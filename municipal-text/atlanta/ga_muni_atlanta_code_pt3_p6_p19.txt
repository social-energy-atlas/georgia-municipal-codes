No. 1998-27, §§ 7—10, 5-12-98; Ord. No. 2000-30, § 1, 5-23-00; Ord. No. 2000-54, § 1, 10-10-00; Ord. No. 2001-69, § 1, 9-26-01; Ord. No. 2002-64, § 1, 8-26-02; Ord. No. 2004-49, §§ 1—3, 8-20-04; Ord.

Sec. 8-2097. - Legal effect.     It is not the purpose or intention of this article that any law be held to be in conflict with it and hereby repealed; rather, it is the intention of this article to be given the legal effect set forth in section 8-2082. (Code 1977, § 8-2097) 
Sec. 8-2098. - Vacant buildings; nuisances. (a)  It is hereby found that there are buildings and other structures and parts of compartmentalized buildings and structures in the city of all zoning classifications which are vacant. By reason of their continued vacancy, these buildings and other structures are subjected to vandalism primarily brought about by reason of removing various parts of the structure. Removal of parts of the structure creates a condition whereby such buildings and other structures are subject to an unauthorized entry. It is further found that when such buildings and other structures are subject to an unauthorized entry, they become a breeding ground for victimless criminal activity, such as, but not limited to, intemperate use of alcoholic beverages and use of drugs, thus leading to incidences of destruction of such buildings and other structures by fire and also creating health and sanitation hazards. Additionally, it is found that other criminal activity, such as, but not limited to, murder and rape, are likewise carried on in such buildings and other structures. Such an unauthorized entry allows various classes of criminal conduct to be carried on in such clandestine surroundings. It is further found that such activity occurs in buildings and structures that may not, within the meaning of applicable portions of Georgia laws and of the Atlanta Housing Code, be subject to demolition and other proceedings. (b)  Therefore, and in furtherance of the legislative findings hereinabove set forth, it is hereby declared by the council that such buildings and other structures, upon a proper adjudication of such as a nuisance as hereinafter provided, are a nuisance and, under the police power of the city, subject to appropriate abatement proceedings. Further, it is hereby declared by the council that such buildings and other structures are nuisances not only with respect to the safety of the inhabitants of the city, but also with respect to the health, sanitation and welfare of the inhabitants of the city. (Code 1977, § 8-2098)

Sec. 8-2100.3. - Cost to city; lien on property.     The amount of the cost of having the nuisance abated by the city, either by contract with a third party or by employees of the city, shall constitute a lien upon the building or structure, and the property upon which it stands, for which execution may issue as for property taxes in accordance with any present or future law of the State of Georgia and ordinances of the City of Atlanta, governing tax enforcement and collection. (Code 1977, § 8-2100.3)

Sec. 8-2181. - Housing code adopted, incorporated by reference.     The Atlanta Housing Code of 1980 is hereby revised and is ordained, enacted and adopted as a general ordinance of the city. Each of the sections and articles of that code is ordained, enacted and adopted as fully as though set out in full in this section. (Code 1977, § 8-2181) Cross reference— Housing code text, app. E. 
Sec. 8-2182. - Barrier-free requirements. (a)  Statement of Intent. The provisions of this section are specifically enacted to further the policy of the city to provide that new single-family, duplexes and triplexes which are constructed with public funds, as herein described, be provided with design features to provide accessibility and usability for physically disabled people. The purpose of this section is to specifically promulgate certain standards which may be less restrictive than ANSI A117.1 while economically providing solutions to accessibility. (b)  Applicability. The following regulations shall be applicable to new single-family dwellings, duplexes, and triplexes which receive city assistance. For purposes of this section, "city assistance" shall mean funding or assistance from the city or any agency thereof, through any of the following means: (i) receipt of a building contract or similar contractual agreement involving any city-funded program or fund, including but not limited to the Urban Residential Finance Authority (URFA), the Housing Trust Fund, or similar programs; (ii) real estate purchased, leased or donated from the city or any agency thereof; (iii) receipt of preferential tax treatment, bond assistance, mortgage assistance, or similar financial advantages derived from the city or any agency thereof; (iv) dispersal under city auspices of any federal or state construction funds as CDBG; or (v) receipt of any other funding or financial benefit from the city or any agency thereof. (c)  Design Requirements. The following design requirements shall apply:     Requirement 1. Building entrances. Applicable dwelling units shall be designed and constructed to have at least one building entrance on an accessible route served by a ramp complying with ANSI A117.1-1986, section 4.8, having a maximum slope not to exceed twelve (1:12), unless it is impractical to do so because of terrain or unusual characteristics of the site. Such building entrance doors shall comply with ANSI A117.1, 4.13, and shall have a minimum clear opening of 32 inches.     Any entrance at the front, side or back of the dwelling is acceptable as long as it is served by an accessible route such as a garage or sidewalk.     Requirement 2. Interior door criteria. All dwelling units, whether or not on an accessible route, shall be designed in such a manner that all the doors designed to allow passage into and within all premises are sufficiently wide to allow passage by persons in wheelchairs. Lever hardware is required.     Doors, except those serving closets less than 15 square feet in area, within individual dwelling units intended for user passage must provide minimum 32″ clear opening. A 2′-10″ door or standard 6′-0″ sliding patio door assembly is deemed sufficient to comply with this requirement; provided however, compliance with ANSI section 4.13.6 (Maneuvering Clearance at Doors) shall not be mandatory.     Requirement 3. Accessible routes into and through the dwelling unit. An accessible route shall be designed and constructed in such a manner that a 36″ wide level route, except at doors, must be provided through the main floor of the unit with ramped or beveled changes at door thresholds.     Requirement 4. Wall reinforcement in bathrooms. Reinforcement in the walls shall be provided at designated locations as specified by ANSI A 117.1, section 4.24, section 4.32, figure 48 and figure 49 so that grab bars may be installed, if needed, at a later date without the necessity of removing portions of the existing wall.     Requirement 5. Light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats and other environmental controls. All applicable dwelling units shall be designed and constructed in such a manner that all premises contain light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats and other controls in accessible locations.     Controls shall meet the requirements of ANSI A117.1, section 4.25. Where multiple controls serve the same elements (e.g., two remote switches for a light) only one need be accessible. (d)  Contracts. The provisions of this section shall be incorporated in all city contracts. (e)  Waiver of Exterior Disability Accessibility Regulations. The requirements of subsection (c), requirement 1 (Building Entrances) herein may be waived by the commissioner of housing, through the issuance of an "Exterior Disability Accessibility Waiver" ("waiver").     A person requesting said waiver shall file an application for disability accessibility waiver with the commissioner, including all documents necessary to prove the existence of the exemption standard herein. The application shall demonstrate that topographical conditions on the site render it impossible to comply with the provisions of subsection (c).     If the application so demonstrates, the commissioner shall issue an exterior disability accessibility waiver to the applicant, in writing, within ten days of receipt of a completed application, which shall become an official component of any issued contract. The commissioner shall retain a copy of said waiver in the department's official records, and shall also forward a copy of said waiver to the director, bureau of buildings at the time of issuance. (Code 1977, § 8-2182) Code of ordinances reference— Human relations, ch. 94.

It is the responsibility of the neighborhood planning unit to schedule said application for consideration at a meeting within six weeks after the semimonthly deadline and to provide the bureau of planning with a letter presenting its comments on the application. The applicant is encouraged to attend the neighborhood planning unit meeting. The chairperson and the NPU shall review the proposed subdivision plat utilizing only the standards and criteria set forth in this part and provide a copy of said comments to the applicant and to district and at-large members of council representing the district within which the subject property is located. The bureau of planning shall post a sign so as to inform the adjacent neighborhood of a proposed subdivision application. Said sign shall include the date of the scheduled NPU meeting at which said application will be discussed. (e)  Action by Commissioner of Public Works. No preliminary subdivision plat shall be approved prior to the receipt of a letter from the commissioner of the department of public works approving the subject preliminary subdivision plat as being in compliance with the provisions of this part and any other applicable code provisions, rules and regulations. No final subdivision plat shall be approved until all required improvements have been made, inspected and accepted by the commissioner of the department of public works. Further, no final subdivision plat shall be approved prior to the commissioner of the department of public works having approved the subject final subdivision plat by affixing his or her signature to the original copy of the final plat as being in compliance with this part and any other applicable code provisions, rules and regulations. (f)  Action by Director of Bureau of Planning. (1)  After all changes and corrections identified in the meeting of the subdivision review committee are made, and after approval by the commissioner of the department of public works as is provided in (e) above, the application shall be presented to the director of the bureau of planning for approval or disapproval of the preliminary subdivision plat or the final subdivision plat, as the case may be.

No. 2005-05, § 1, 1-24-05; Ord. No. 2007-55(07-O-0682), § 2, 9-24-07; Ord. No. 2007-56(07-O-1899), § 15, 9-24-07; Ord. No. 2018-11(18-O-1023), § 14, 5-16-18 ) 
Sec. 15-07.006. - Acknowledgement of lots of record existing prior to the sub-division ordinance. (a)  Eligible Lots. The director shall acknowledge lots with a legal description filed with Clerk of the Superior Court of Fulton County or DeKalb County prior to November 19, 1958, the effective date of the City of Atlanta Subdivision Ordinance, and which do not appear on the official cadastral map on which the bureau of planning has recorded the boundaries of lots recognized by the City of Atlanta provided that all of the following criteria can be satisfied: 1.  No portion of the property in any of the lots to be acknowledged shall have been included in any plat recorded with any other boundaries or dimensions in a manner that shows the intent to abandon the original property lines. Even if the lots on the subject property are currently in their original configuration, any past combination of any portion of the subject properties with another property in a manner that does not evidence intent to maintain the lots in their original configuration shall be considered an abandonment of the original property lines. 2.  Where a single deed includes multiple lots, only a separate metes and bounds description of each individual lot shall be a sufficient description of the original property lines. A legal description in a single deed which identifies multiple lots by reference to lot numbers on a subdivision plat shall not be considered to be a sufficient identification of individual boundaries to justify creation of lots of record unless the metes and bound descriptions of each of the individual lots are also set forth in that deed. A single deed referring to multiple lots on a subdivision plat created under the city's subdivision ordinance and approved and on file with the bureau of planning shall not be required to have a metes and bounds description in the deed so long as the subdivision plat contains a metes and bounds description of the lots and no principal structure, including decks, and porches and other attachments that would ordinarily be included in the building footprint, was constructed over any of the property lines of any lot to be acknowledged. 3.  No primary structure, including decks, and porches and other attachments that would ordinarily be included in the building footprint, shall have been constructed over any of the property lines of the lot to be acknowledged, regardless of whether such primary structure or the attachment thereto, has been or will be demolished. Any document or site plan submitted to the city at any time which shows that a building permit for the primary structure or an addition thereto was requested and granted shall be considered proof that such structure was constructed in that configuration even if the structure no longer exists. 4.  The person requesting the acknowledgment of the lot can produce a full and unbroken abstract of title for the exact legal description to be acknowledged which meets the current Title Standards of the State Bar of Georgia and which is attested to by an attorney licensed by the State of Georgia. The abstract of title must show to the satisfaction of the director that the lots to be acknowledged meet the requirements of this section. 5.  The acknowledgment of the lot does not conflict with other section of the City Code with respect to the creation of new lots of record. 6.  The application procedure is successfully completed. (b)  Legal Effect. Lots approved as lots of record under this section shall be considered legally non-conforming lots of record and shall be recorded on the official cadastral map of the City of Atlanta. (c)  Setback Requirements. Acknowledgement of lots of record under the process provided in this section shall not excuse an applicant for a building permit from any setback requirements for the zoning district where the lot is located. (d)  Other Procedures Available. Applications that do not meet the criteria for acknowledgement of lots of record may still be eligible for subdivision of the property so long as the proposed subdivision meets all other requirements of the City Code. (e)  Procedure for Application. Applicants requesting acknowledgement of historically platted lots of record shall comply with the following procedure: 1.  File a request for acknowledgement on the application form made available by the director. An application shall be accepted when offered to the bureau of planning and the director may designate one or more persons to accept applications. The address on the application is the location where the applicant agrees that all notices and other written communication shall be received. 2.  Each owner of record must show their consent to the procedure as evidenced by the submission of a notarized consent form in substantially the form and containing the same information as that form made available by the director. Consent forms from all owners of record must be submitted as a part of the application package before an application will be accepted. 3.  Submit a certified copy of the recorded plat currently on file in Fulton and/or DeKalb County. The plat must clearly outline the boundary dimensions of the subject lot and must be legible. 4.  Submit a full and unbroken abstract of title for the exact legal description to be acknowledged which meets the current Title Standards of the State Bar of Georgia and which is attested to by an attorney licensed by the State of Georgia. (i)  The abstract of title must document that each lot to be recreated is eligible under the criteria set forth in this section. (ii)  The abstract of title must document the transfer of the original lots since the recording of the original plat and document that no transaction has involved the abandonment of property lines through the combination or recombination of any portion of the original lots on the subject property with each other or with other adjacent properties. 5.  Submit three copies of a recordable plat or survey showing existing and proposed property boundaries and all other applicable information specified in section 15-07.004. (i)  The plat or survey must be clear and legible and shall not exceed 17"x 22". (ii)  The plat or survey must show the proposed property boundaries as a solid line. (iii)  The plat or survey must include original signatures across the surveyor's seal on the mylar and/or on the copies. (f)  Procedure for Processing of Application. A request for acknowledgement application which meets the above criteria shall be acted on by staff authorized by the director to decide on the application provided that: 1.  Within five business days after the close of the semimonthly filing deadline when an acknowledgement application is received, the director, bureau of planning, has distributed a copy of each application to be considered, with accompanying plats and other drawings, to the following: (i)  District councilmember (ii)  Urban Design Commission (iii)  Chair of the Neighborhood Planning Unit (NPU) 2.  The applicant has posted a sign that the property is the subject of an application for acknowledgement of lots of record no later than 15 days prior to the date of the NPU meeting where the application is to be considered and presents a posting affidavit to be included with the application no later than the date of the meeting of the bureau of planning lot of record staff review where the application is to be considered. 3.  The NPU has had opportunity for review and consideration of the acknowledgement application in accord with the following: (i)  The NPU has considered the application at a meeting held within six weeks after the semimonthly deadline closing date. (ii)  Failure of the NPU to consider the acknowledgement application within the required period after receipt of notice from the director shall be considered waiver of the opportunity for review. (iii)  If the applicant requests deferral of NPU consideration and so informs the director, the NPU consideration at the agreed upon meeting date shall be considered timely and the director may reschedule consideration of the application. If the NPU defers on the consideration of the application, this shall be considered waiver of the opportunity for review. (iv)  The NPU shall be responsible for making its recommendations available to the director for consideration by the staff. 4.  Failure of the director to accomplish the tasks required for the required notifications shall not entitle an applicant to approval of the application but the applicant shall have the right to have their application reviewed by the bureau of planning within 180 days of the date that a complete application is received. (g)  Citizen Input. During the lot of record staff review meeting provided in this section, citizens may present information to the director refuting the validity of the deeds or other documentation submitted by the applicant showing the transfer of the original lots since the recording of the original deeds. This information should be presented to the director in writing, at least five business days prior to the date of the subdivision review committee meeting associated with the closing date for the application, which shall be the first date on which the request will be eligible for a final decision by the staff. Information not timely received may not be considered. (h)  Applicant to be Present at Lot of Record Staff Review Meeting. The applicant or his or her designee is required to be present at the time that the staff reviews the application and to provide any additional data that is required by this chapter. Within ten business days after each such meeting, each applicant shall be notified by the director in writing of a list of problems or deficiencies, if any, in the application identified by the staff. (i)  Amendments to the Application. The applicant shall have no more than 30 days from receipt of comments outlined in subsection (h) above to submit amendments to the application to address the problems or deficiencies identified in the lot of record staff review meeting.

The director shall review and take action on the application within 60 days of the date of meeting of the subdivision review committee associated with the closing date for the acknowledgement application or the last date that amendments are received from whichever is later. The applicant may request in writing that the date for final decision by the director be deferred to a date certain but the director shall not be required to agree to extend the date of decision.

No subdivision shall be approved in which lots are created on only one side of a new street. No subdivision shall be approved in which there is a reserved strip of land along any portion of any street proposed to be created, regardless of the form of ownership which may be proposed for the reserved strip of land, except in the case of a parcel acquired by the applicant to provide access to an interior subdivision. In that event the access parcel shall be wide enough to contain the required street right-of-way and in addition shall have a width equal to the width required to provide the minimum corner lot side setback from the proposed street to each existing house on the contiguous lots.

Sec. 16-02.002. - General districts established.     In order to classify, regulate and restrict the location of trades and industries, and the location of buildings designed for specific uses; to regulate and limit the bulk of buildings hereafter erected or structurally altered; to regulate and determine the areas of yards, courts and other open spaces within and surrounding such buildings, the city is hereby divided into general districts, of which there shall be 19 in number, known as follows: R-1 Single-Family Residential District R-2 Single-Family Residential District R-3 Single-Family Residential District R-4 Single-Family Residential District R-5 Two-Family Residential District R-G Residential General District R-LC Residential-Limited Commercial District O-I Office Institutional District C-1 Community Business District C-2 Commercial Service District C-3 Commercial Residential District C-4 Central Area Commercial-Residential District C-5 Central Business Support District I-1 Light Industrial District I-2 Heavy Industrial District SPI-1 Central Core District SPI-2 North Avenue District SPI-3 Midtown District SPI-4 Arts Center District (Code 1977, § 16-02.002) 
Sec. 16-02.003. - Conditional zoning. (1)  Each general district established in section 16-02.002 shall have a subclassification thereunder known as "conditional" for that classification. (2)  All zoning districts as shown on the official zoning map with a suffix "C" after the district designation (i.e. C-1-C) denote that the parcel is zoned "conditional" under previous ordinance amendments by the council. Such conditions shall remain in effect, and copies of such conditional ordinances may be obtained from the clerk of council. (3)  Except as specifically modified by this section, an application for conditional zoning shall be treated as an amendment and shall be subject to the requirements and procedures of chapter 27. (4)  Applicant may apply for conditional zoning and shall so state on the application. The conditional zoning application may be based on written conditions contained within the application and the subsequent zoning amendment, or it may be based on a site plan. All applications for conditional zoning shall be accompanied by survey of the property drawn to scale showing the tract boundaries which shall have been prepared by a registered land surveyor or registered professional engineer. Further each conditional zoning application shall specify the use or uses proposed for each structure to be located on the site. All applications for conditional zoning which are supported by a site plan shall in addition to the requirements cited above also contain plans showing the following: (a)  Location and size of proposed structures including number of stories and total floor area. (b)  Location and size of parking areas, including loading spaces with proposed ingress/egress, and (c)  The specific types and dimensions of any walls, fences, planted buffers or visual screens. (5)  Plans shall be prepared by or under the supervision of a registered architect, landscape architect, or planner holding the designation of member of the American Institute of Certified Planners, competent in the preparation of detailed and accurate plans. Said plans shall be drawn to scale and shall contain the signature, seal and/or state registration number of the professional by whom or under whose supervision said plan was prepared. Said plans shall contain the following certification: "I hereby certify that I am familiar with the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Atlanta, as amended. I further certify that to the best of my knowledge and ability, these plans are accurate and comply with the district and general regulations of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Atlanta." Plans in support of an application for conditional zoning shall be submitted in triplicate. (6)  The zoning review board, after the required public hearing, may recommend approval of the conditional application as submitted, may recommend denial of the application, or may recommend a change in the conditions, as deemed appropriate. (7)  After approval of the conditional zoning ordinance by the mayor and council, a request for a building permit shall be submitted to the director, bureau of buildings, who shall make the determination that the final building and site plans are in conformance with the approved site plan and with any conditions attached by the council. An approved site plan shall not be deemed to authorize the violation of any of the terms or requirements of this zoning ordinance. Minor changes in the approved site plan may be authorized by the director, bureau of planning. For the purposes of this chapter, a minor change in the approved site plan means a change to a site plan that was approved by the city council as a condition of a zoning ordinance, provided that the change in layout does not result in the visible intrusion of any building, structure, driveway, walkway, parking lot, plaza, wall, or similar built element into any open space, yard, landscaped buffer, undeveloped space, or any similar space, when any such space is shown on the site plan as being next to and visible from a property line or street. The term "minor change" does not include any increase in the height in feet of any building or structure, any increase in the number of parking spaces, any increase in total square footage of any heated and/or livable space of any buildings and/or structures, or the addition of any buildings or structures, driveways, roads, or parking lots into any open space, yard, landscaped buffer, undeveloped space, or any similar space when any such space is shown on the approved site plan as lying next to and visible from a property line or street. (8)  If for any reason, development and use of property approved in accordance with the procedure outlined above cannot be accomplished, the plans shall not be altered, changed or varied, except after approval by the council. Applications for amendments to any site plan shall be filed in triplicate with the bureau of planning. (Code 1977, § 16-02.003; Ord. No. 1999-32, § 1, 3-5-99) 
Sec. 16-02.004. - Special public interest district maps; historic and cultural conservation district maps; parking limitation district maps, and pedestrian space plan map. (1)  Where Special Public Interest (SPI) or Historic and Cultural Conservation (HC) districts have the effect of modifying requirements, regulations and procedures applying in existing districts or districts hereafter created and remaining after SPI or HC districts are superimposed, such districts may either be indicated by overlay designation on the official zoning map or by SPI or HC districts; the district boundaries and designation shall be shown on the official zoning map. The parking limitation district maps and the pedestrian plan maps relate to the SPI districts. (2)  Flood Hazard District Map, Chattahoochee Corridor Map, and MARTA Corridor Map. Within areas on the flood hazard district map indicated as subject to flood hazards, in addition to the regulations and procedures applying generally, certain special limitations, requirements and procedures shall apply as hereinafter set forth [see chapter 21]. The flood hazard districts may be shown either by overlay designation or on the official zoning map. For regulations and procedures applying to Chattahoochee Corridor and MARTA Corridor, see chapter 23. (3)  Airport Maps. Within any airport district designated on the official zoning map, in addition to all zoning regulations, special regulations shall apply. See chapter 22. The airport maps are composed of airport district map, DeKalb-Peachtree Airport map, Fulton County Airport map, Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport map, and standards and specifications for airports. (4)  Inset Maps.

No. 2004-51, §§ 1, 2, 8-20-04) 
Sec. 16-02.005. - Authentication; location for public inspection.     The official zoning map, properly attested, shall be available for public inspection in the office of the Bureau of Planning, and shall be the final authority as to zoning status of lands. Proper attestation shall mean the verification of amendments of the official zoning map made through legislation in the manner required by state law and the procedures and requirements of these regulations. No zoning designation listed on the official zoning map which is not supported by legislative action adopted in the manner required by state law and the procedures and requirements of these regulations shall be considered to have been properly attested. (Code 1977, § 16-02.005; Ord. No. 2009-15(09-O-0211), § 1, 5-12-09) 
Sec. 16-02.006. - Recording amendments to official zoning map.     On the effective date of a properly attested amendment of the official zoning map, the change shall be posted in an appropriate manner and records accompanying the map shall identify the official action by which such amendment was made, the date of such action, and the date of posting. No such amendment shall become effective until such change and entry has been made. (Code 1977, § 16-02.006; Ord. No. 2009-15(09-O-0211), § 2, 5-12-09) 
Sec. 16-02.007. - Unauthorized changes in official zoning map.     No change of any nature shall be made in the official zoning map except in conformity with the procedures and requirements of these regulations. (Code 1977, § 16-02.007) 
Sec. 16-02.008. - Replacement of official zoning map.     If the official zoning map becomes damaged, lost or difficult to interpret by reason of the nature or number of changes, the council may by ordinance authorize a new official zoning map which shall supersede the prior map; provided, however, that if there is uncertainty about the zoning status of any area because of the condition of the map or any part thereof, such action shall take the form of an amendment to the zoning ordinance, and shall resolve the uncertainty.     The new official zoning map may correct drafting or other omissions or errors in the prior map, but no such correction shall have the effect of amendment as to zoning status unless the action adopting such map is an amending action. The new official zoning map shall be authenticated and attested as for the original, with wording indicating when and by what instrument the prior document was adopted.     Unless the prior official zoning map has been lost or wholly destroyed, said documents or any remaining significant parts thereof shall be preserved, together with any significant records pertaining to its adoption or amendment, as a guide to prior zoning status of areas. (Code 1977, § 16-02.008) 
Sec. 16-02.009. - Rules for interpretation of boundaries.     Where uncertainties exist as to the boundaries shown on the official zoning map, the following rules shall guide interpretations by the administrative official charged with administration and enforcement of these regulations. (Code 1977, § 16-02.009) 
Sec. 16-02.010. - Center lines as boundaries.     Where boundaries appear to follow center lines of streets, alleys, easements, railroads, waterways and the like, they shall be construed as following such center lines. (Code 1977, § 16-02.010) 
Sec. 16-02.011. - Property and other lines as boundaries.     Where boundaries appear to follow street, lot, block, property, or other lines, they shall be construed as following such lines; provided, however, that in the event of closure of a street or alley, the boundary shall be construed as the center line of the preexisting street or alley unless specific amendment is made otherwise. (Code 1977, § 16-02.011) 
Sec. 16-02.012. - Boundaries extending into water.     Where the full course of boundaries extending into bodies of water is not shown, such boundaries shall be construed as continuing in a straight line to the intersection with another zoning boundary or to jurisdictional limits if no such intersection with another zoning boundary occurs first. (Code 1977, § 16-02.012) 
Sec. 16-02.013. - Boundaries other than as above.     Boundaries which appear parallel or perpendicular to, or as connecting or extensions of, center lines, property lines or other features shown shall be so construed unless there are specific indications to the contrary. (Code 1977, § 16-02.013) 
Sec. 16-02.014. - Dimensions.     Where dimensions are not otherwise indicated on the map, the scale of the map shall govern. (Code 1977, § 16-02.014) 
Sec. 16-02.015. - Where district designation is not indicated for an area.     Where a district designation is not indicated for an area of the official zoning map, it shall be construed to be zoned R-1. Upon discovery of such omission, unless research reveals the correct official zoning status of the land (in which case map corrections and entries relating thereto may be made without legislative action), a corrective amendment shall be initiated by the bureau of planning. (Code 1977, § 16-02.015) 
Sec. 16-02.016. - Boundary changes with changes in jurisdictional boundaries.     Where territory is removed from the jurisdictional limits of the city, zoning boundaries shall be construed as moving with the jurisdictional limits. Where territory is added to the city, unless zoning amendment is concurrent with such annexation, district designation shall be construed as provided in the case of omission of indication (section 16-02.015); and the bureau of planning shall initiate an amendment within 90 days of such annexation. (Code 1977, § 16-02.016) 
Sec. 16-02.017. - Bureau of planning action in cases of uncertainty; extension of regulations in the case of split lots.     Where natural or man-made features existing are at variance with those shown on the official zoning map, or in other circumstances not covered above, upon request from the director, bureau of buildings, or from any affected property owner, or on its own initiative upon determination that such inconsistencies exist, the bureau of planning shall make a finding and interpretation concerning the boundaries involved in accord with the intent and purpose of this part.     In cases where such findings and interpretation involves only correction to the zoning map and does not change the zoning of property, such corrections shall be made by or at the direction of the bureau of planning without further action, other than appropriate entries as to the nature of the change and the date made.     In cases where the zoning district boundary divides a lot of record at the time the boundary was established, the bureau of planning, upon application by the owner of the property or his duly authorized agent, shall make findings and prepare recommendations as to this boundary line. If the bureau finds and recommends that, in view of the circumstances or the property involved and its relation to adjoining properties, the extension of the district boundary not to exceed 100 feet would not create substantial adverse effects on adjoining property, this boundary line may be revised.

In no case shall a parking lot owner be required to provide landscaped areas that exceed ten percent of the paved area. (5)  A minimum of one tree per eight parking spaces shall be included in the required landscaped areas. For the purposes of satisfying this requirement, existing trees that are two and one-half inches or more in caliper as measured at a height 36 inches above ground level, shall be considered to be equivalent to one or more newly planted trees on the basis of one tree for each two and one-half inches in caliper. (6)  In addition to trees, ground cover shall be provided in order to protect tree roots and to prevent erosion. Ground cover shall consist of shrubs, ivy, liriope, pine bark mulch, and other similar landscaping materials. (7)  Shrubs shall be maintained at a maximum height of two and one-half feet, except where such shrubs are screening the parking surface from an adjacent residential use. (8)  In the event that landscaped areas are in the interior of a parking lot they shall be a minimum of six feet in width and six feet in length with a minimum area of 36 square feet. (9)  Continuous landscaped buffer strips shall be constructed along sidewalks and public rights-of-way where surface parking lots are adjacent to such sidewalks or public rights-of-way, except at points of ingress and egress into the facility. Such landscaped buffer strips shall be a minimum of five feet in width and shall contain, in addition to ground cover, trees planted a maximum of 42.5 feet on center along the entire length. (10)  Newly planted trees shall be a minimum of two and one-half inches in caliper as measured at a height six inches above ground level; shall be a minimum of ten feet in height; shall have a 40-foot minimum mature height and shall be drought-tolerant. Trees shall be planted a minimum of 30 inches from any barrier curb, so as to prevent injury to trees from vehicle bumpers. (11)  Where landscaped areas are located adjacent to vehicle overhangs, the trees shall be planted in line with the side stripes between parking spaces in order to avoid injury to trees by vehicle bumpers. (12)  All landscaped areas, including trees located in the public right-of-way that are counted in the fulfillment of this requirement, shall be properly maintained in accordance with approved landscape plans. In the event that a tree or any plant material dies, it shall be replaced within six months so as to meet all requirements of this section and to allow for planting in the appropriate planting season. (13)  Notwithstanding subsection (4) above, existing parking lots shall not be required to reduce the number of parking spaces by more than three percent as a result of implementing these landscaping regulations. (14)  If it is determined by the bureau of planning that implementation of these regulations will result in the loss of parking spaces in existing lots, the director of the bureau of traffic and transportation may increase the percentage of allowable compact car spaces from 25 percent up to 35 percent so as to minimize the loss of parking spaces. (15)  Administrative variances may be granted by the director, bureau of planning only upon making all of the following findings: (a)  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, topography, subsurface conditions, overhead structures or the existence of sufficient trees in the public right-of-way within ten feet of the property line; (b)  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and (c)  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Atlanta. (16)  Owners, lessees, or authorized agents of existing parking lots shall be required to submit a landscaping plan within 12 months of the effective date of this section, which illustrates the proposed application of these landscaping regulations.

Sec. 16-18.001. - Statement of intent.     It is the intent of these regulations to permit creation of Special Public Interest (SPI) Districts: (1)  In general areas officially designated as having special and substantial public interest in protection of existing or proposed character, or of principal views of, from, or through such areas; (2)  Surrounding individual buildings or grounds where there is special and substantial public interest in protecting such buildings and their visual environment; or (3)  In other cases where special and substantial public interest requires modification of existing zoning regulations, or repeal and replacement of such regulations, for the accomplishment of special public purposes for which the district was established.     It is further intended that such districts and the regulations established therein shall be in accord with and promote the purposes set forth in the comprehensive development plan and other officially adopted plans of the city in accordance with it, and shall encourage land use and development in substantial accord with the physical design set forth therein. (Code 1977, § 16-18.001) 
Sec. 16-18.002. - Effect of SPI district designation.     Such SPI districts shall: (1)  Supplant districts or portions of districts existing at the time of creation of a particular SPI district; or (2)  Have the effect of modifying requirements, regulations, and procedures applying in existing districts or districts hereafter created and remaining after SPI districts are superimposed, to the extent indicated in the particular SPI amendment. (3)  The statement of intent for all SPI districts shall specify whether the district supplants existing districts or modifies district regulations. (Code 1977, § 16-18.002) 
Sec. 16-18.003. - Preparation of recommendations for special SPI zoning.     Recommendations for specific SPI zoning amendments shall be prepared by the bureau of planning on its own initiative or at the direction of the council. Each recommendation shall identify the proposed zoning by the SPI prefix and a number identifying the particular district, as for example SPI-1. The identification may also include language indicating the character or location of the district. The recommendation shall contain information and suggestions as indicated below concerning the areas, buildings, and/or premises proposed for such regulations: (1)  Statement of intent: The application shall include a statement of intent, specifying the nature of the special and substantial public interest involved and the objectives to be promoted by special regulations and/or procedures, within the district as a whole, or within subareas of the district, if division in such subareas is reasonably necessary for achievement of regulatory purposes. (2)  Proposed district boundaries: The recommendation shall include a map or maps indicating: (a)  The boundaries of the SPI district and any subareas established within the district for purposes of SPI regulations. (b)  The zoning designations of all portions of underlying districts, if any, which will remain when SPI zoning is superimposed and the general regulations which will be affected by the superimposed SPI zoning. Where it is proposed to change the boundaries or zoning designation of remaining underlying districts affected in the same action by which SPI zoning is applied, the map shall show the nature and location of such change. (c)  The location and zoning designation of districts or portions of districts, if any, to be supplanted by SPI zoning. (3)  Proposed regulations. The bureau of planning's recommendations shall include proposed regulations designed to promote the special purposes of the district, as set forth in the statement of intent. In particular, such regulations may require submission of detailed site plans, building plans and elevations, and maps indicating the relation of proposed development to surrounding or otherwise affected property in terms of location, amount, character and continuity of open space; protection of desirable principal views; convenience of access through and between buildings or in other locations where appropriate for public purposes and where such access will reduce vehicular/pedestrian conflicts on public streets; lighting; mixtures of proposed uses; and other matters as appropriate to determinations related to the special interest of the district and the objectives to be promoted. (Code 1977, § 16-18.003) 
Sec. 16-18.004. - Procedural requirements.     Adoption of SPI districts shall be by the same procedures as for amendments generally. (Code 1977, § 16-18.004) 
Sec. 16-18.005. - Special administrative permit requirement for building permits: Effect on other special permit requirements.     Except as provided below, no building permit in any SPI district shall be issued unless and until it has been approved through the approval of a special administrative permit under the requirements so specified in section 16-25.004, as meeting applicable requirements and intent as set forth for the district involved.     Where regulations may require the approval of special administrative permits for other purposes so specified, processing by the director, bureau of planning shall without additional application include consideration of the other special administrative permits. Where such regulations require special exception or special use permit action, the special administrative permit for building permit purposes shall not be issued until separate application has been made for such special exception or special use permit and the necessary approvals have been obtained. (Code 1977, § 16-18.005) 
Sec. 16-18.006. - Classes of cases exempted from detailed review requirements.     The director, bureau of planning may exempt certain classes of applications for building permits from detailed review requirements as set forth above upon written findings that generally within SPI districts, the actions proposed are of such a character or of such a scale as to make detailed reviews and approval by the planning director unnecessary. Where applications for building permits are determined by reference to such findings to be thus exempted, the permit shall be issued if otherwise lawful. (Code 1977, § 16-18.006) 
Sec. 16-18.007. - Provisions for variations from regulations applying generally in SPI districts.     As part of general action when plans require approval of a special administrative permit, regulations for a particular SPI district or for specified classes of SPI districts, the director, bureau of planning may authorize variations from regulations generally applying based on written findings that: (a)  A plan proposed by an applicant, while not strictly in accord with regulations applying generally within the district, meets public purposes and provides public protection to an equivalent or greater degree; or (b)  In the particular circumstances of the case, strict application of a particular regulation or regulations is not necessary for the accomplishment of public purposes or the provision of public protection, at the time or in the future.     Notation concerning the existence of such variation shall be made on the official zoning map, by appropriate identification and date; and a copy of the variation shall be filed in the office of the bureau of buildings for future guidance and as a public record. As appropriate to the circumstances of the case, a copy shall also be recorded with the clerk of the council.     The council or other officials or agencies of the city charged with approval responsibilities under SPI procedures may also be authorized in regulations applying generally within the district upon making findings in a particular case that such variations are necessary to achieve public purposes set forth for the district, or for public protection or the protection of the environs of particular buildings or premises of special and substantial public interest, or to ease the transition from one district to another. Among other things, such variations may require relocation or increase in yards or other open space generally required, reduction in height generally permitted, additional limitations on uses, signs or illumination, and buffering and screening to a greater degree than generally required. (Code 1977, § 16-18.007)

Sec. 16-18E.012. - Residential subareas: Architectural requirements.     In addition to the general regulations and provisions of this chapter, and except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the following architectural regulations shall apply to all residential subareas: (1)  Definitions. For the purposes of interpreting this code section, the following definitions shall apply: a.  Neighborhood means the Inman Park Neighborhood as it exists on the official neighborhood map of the City of Atlanta. b.  Substantially proportional means that the element in question, such as roof pitch, scale, mass, or height, is sufficiently proportional to that found in the chosen architectural style to allow a trained observer to identify the new construction as originating from said architectural style. c.  Substantially characteristic means that the material in question, such as brickwork, stonework, or roofing material, reflects visual qualities that are sufficiently characteristic of those found in the chosen architectural style to allow a trained observer to confirm that the new construction is consistent with said architectural style. (2)  Statement of intent. The council finds that the following established residential architectural styles currently exist in the neighborhood and contribute to its unique historic character: Queen Anne; Folk Victorian; High Victorian Eclectic; Neoclassical Revival; Dutch Colonial Revival; Prairie; Stick; and Craftsman. The purpose of the following regulations is to set forth basic, minimum standards of architectural design and construction that are consistent with these existing historic styles of residences within the neighborhood, as the cumulative historic diversity of the built environment is a defining characteristic of this neighborhood. It is not the intent of these regulations to limit the design of new housing to replication of existing structures, but rather to foster residential design that incorporates the historic architectural elements and materials that are specific to the neighborhood in a meaningful, coherent manner. The following regulations are intended to achieve basic compatibility with these existing architectural styles while simultaneously encouraging consistent, creative designs that are more than a mere aggregation of random historic elements, through the use of specific standards and criteria. In addition, these regulations are intended to integrate the aesthetic and physical characteristics of new construction and landscape in this area into the existing neighborhood and public park areas in a meaningful way so as to restore and promote the public health, safety and welfare of this community. (3)  Standards for criteria. The following standards and criteria shall apply to all new construction in the residential subareas: a.  All new construction on each lot shall be representative of a single architectural style chosen from those styles set forth in subsection (2) above. b.  No individual house design shall be substantially repeated on the same side of a street block. c.  A planting strip not less than four feet in width shall be provided adjacent and parallel to the street and shall remain unpaved. d.  A sidewalk not less than six feet in width shall be provided between the planting strip and the required front yard, parallel to the street. e.  A paved walkway from the front sidewalk to the front entry of the principal structure shall be provided. f.  All front façades, front porches, front steps, and front doors of the principal structure shall face and be parallel to the street. g.  The form and pitch of the roof of new construction shall be substantially proportional to the chosen architectural style. h.  The height, scale, and massing of new construction shall be substantially proportional to the chosen architectural style. In no case shall the height of a structure exceed 35 feet. (See section 16-28.022 for excluded portions of structures.) i.  The first floor of the principal structure shall be on foundations and elevated above grade a minimum of two entrance step risers each of which shall be no less than seven inches in height. j.  Front porches on the principal structure shall be required. The design and size of said front porch shall be substantially proportional to the chosen architectural style, provided that they shall be a minimum of 12 feet wide or one-third the width of the front façade, whichever is greater, and a minimum of eight feet deep. Front porches shall contain roofs, balustrades, columns, steps, and other features typical of the chosen architectural style. Front porches may extend up to ten feet into the required front yard. All front porch steps shall have closed risers and ends. k.  Decks are permitted when located to the rear of the principal structure. l.  When any portion of a chimney is visible as a façade element, the chimney shall originate at grade. m.  Fences and walls, visible from the public right-of-way upon completion, subject to the provisions of section 16-28.008(5) and the following limitations, may occupy required yards: 1.  Fences not exceeding four feet in height may be erected in the front yard.

Sec. 16-18F.002. - Statement of intent.     The intent of this chapter in establishing the SPI-6 Poncey-Highland District is as follows. It is within the public interest to: (1)  Encourage and require architectural and site design compatibility for new construction that will impact existing housing and neighborhood quality within the Highland-North Avenue Historic District and other adjacent neighborhoods of historic and architectural significance. (2)  Encourage and require a high quality of housing development for the entire Presidential Park Development Area, with specific regard to architectural, site and landscape design. (3)  Encourage owner-occupancy of new housing to the maximum extent possible in single-family, two-family and multi-family structures in accordance with housing densities established for RG-1, RG-2 and RG-4 zoning and the layout of the Poncey-Highland Housing Plan identified below. (4)  Encourage the construction of affordable high-quality housing through innovative site and building designs that maintain compatibility with existing housing types in adjacent historic neighborhoods, and the objective of high-quality housing development. (Code 1977, § 16-18F.002) 
Sec. 16-18F.003. - Organization.     The regulations are composed of two (2) parts. The first part includes those regulations which apply to the entire SPI-6 district. The second part includes specific regulations which are unique to each of the subareas. The map entitled, "Poncey-Highland Housing Plan" (hereinafter referred to as PHHP), prepared by the City of Atlanta Bureau of Planning dated July 17, 1987, shall be made a part of these regulations for purposes of delineating the subareas.     The SPI-6 Poncey-Highland District is divided into subareas as follows: (1)  Subarea 1: All new development in this subarea shall be accomplished in accordance with all of the regulations and restrictions of RG zoning for single- and two-family dwellings except as specified in the general regulations for SPI-6 [section 16-18F.004] and the specific regulations for Subarea 1. (2)  Subarea 2: All new development in this subarea shall be accomplished in accordance with all of the regulations and restrictions of RG-2 zoning and a maximum floor area ratio of 0.348 except as specified in the general regulations for SPI-6 [section 16-18F.004] and specific regulations for Subarea 2. (3)  Subarea 3: All new development in this subarea shall be accomplished in accordance with all of the regulations and restrictions of RG-2 zoning and a maximum floor area ratio of 0.348, except as specified in the general regulations for SPI-6 [section 16-18F.004] and the specified regulations for Subarea 3. (4)  Subarea 4: All new development in this subarea shall be accomplished in accordance with all of the regulations and restrictions of RG-4 zoning and a maximum floor area ratio of 1.49 except as specified in the general regulations for SPI-6 and specific regulations for Subarea 4. (Code 1977, § 16-18F.003) 
Sec. 16-18F.004. - General regulations.     The following regulations shall apply to the entire Poncey-Highland SPI-6 District, which includes all subareas. All proposed development shall require preliminary design review by the Atlanta Urban Design Commission (AUDC). Plans submitted for review shall include a site plan at a minimum scale of 1″ = 20′, typical building sections, exterior elevations at a minimum scale of ¼″ = 1′-0″, and outline specifications covering all exterior building and landscaping materials. All final construction documents submitted in application for a building permit shall require a certificate of appropriateness from the AUDC as provided for in sections 16-20.007 and 16-20.008 of this part. All proposed development shall conform to the following regulations; and AUDC shall have the power to hear, grant or deny variances from the terms of these regulations. (1)  Regulations shall be established for all subareas. Regulations as stated herein shall be minimum standards which must be followed and shall be applied by the AUDC. (2)  The compatibility rule: In order to assure that these regulations allow flexibility and accommodate innovative design solutions, many regulations shall be made subject to the compatibility rule, which states that the element in question (site design, architectural scale and exterior architectural elements) shall be similar in character to that which is prevalent for like uses in the immediate area. The compatibility rule is the discretionary device to allow architectural and site design compatibility, and other special design considerations to be assessed by AUDC. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to provide substantiation of various design elements in adjacent, existing residential buildings. (3)  The subdivision of land within the SPI-6 district shall be subject to administrative approval provided for in the Subdivision Regulations of the City of Atlanta. Applications for administrative approval shall not be filed until after required preliminary review by AUDC has occurred. Subdivision of land or combination of lots shall be to the maximum extent feasible, compatible with existing siting characteristics in areas adjoining the SPI-6 district. (4)  Off-street parking: a.  Off-street parking shall not be permitted in the front yard of a lot used for residential purposes. b.  Off-street parking shall be permitted in the rear or side yard of a lot used for residential purposes. c.  Carports or garages shall be permitted if detached from and located to the rear of the main residential structure. If the structure is located on a corner lot, the front yard setback for that side street shall apply to the construction of a carport or garage. Carports and garages should also be permitted if they are part of the main structure and conform to similar existing structures of the older homes. d.  Off-street parking shall not be permitted on vacant lots, except that one adjacent lot owned by the resident occupant may be used to park up to two owners' vehicles in operable condition provided such parking does not fall within the established front, side or rear yard setback and such parking is screened from street view by landscaping or fencing as approved by AUDC. e.  Off-site parking is prohibited. f.  Off-street parking of personal travel trailers, motor homes and trucks in excess of three-quarter ton shall not be permitted overnight. (5)  Accessory structures: The design of all accessory structures as defined by this part shall be subject to design review by AUDC. (6)  Electric vehicle charging stations equipped with Level 1 and/or Level 2 EVSE are permitted as an accessory structure and shall be subject to design review by AUDC. (7)  Site design: a.  It is not the intent of the SPI-6 district regulations to limit new development to single-family lots matching prior subdivision lines. However, where single-family lots are combined for higher residential development, i.e., condominium development, the siting of all multi-family and single-family structures shall retain the appearance of individual lots with front building façades parallel to street rights-of-way or perpendicular to side lot lines where possible, and with building spacings subject to the compatibility rule and design review by AUDC. b.  All buildings shall conform to traditional housing characteristics by having a sidewalk, front walk, front yard, front porch, and front doors facing the street. c.  Driveways extending to parking areas in the side or rear yard shall be a maximum of 10 feet wide where passing through the front yard. d.  Landscaped areas in front of each residential building shall be designed to reinforce the appearance of individual ownership. e.  An appropriate buffer of natural material fences or walls shall be provided between multi-family units and existing residential dwellings.

Sec. 16-18G.011. - Residential Subareas 2 and 3: Architectural requirements.     In addition to the regulations and provisions of this chapter, and except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the following architectural regulations shall apply. (1)  Definitions . For the purposes of interpreting this code section, the following definitions shall apply; a.  Neighborhood means the Candler Park Neighborhood as it exists on the official neighborhood map of the City of Atlanta. b.  Substantially proportional means that the element in question, such as roof pitch, scale, mass, or height, is sufficiently proportional to that found in the chosen architectural style to allow a trained observer to identify the new construction as originating from said architectural style. c.  Substantially characteristic means that the material in question, such as brickwork, stonework, or roofing material, reflects visual qualities that are sufficiently characteristic of those found in the chosen architectural style to allow a trained observer to confirm that the new construction is consistent with said architectural style. (2)  Statement of intent. The council finds that the following established residential architectural styles currently exist in the neighborhood and contribute to its unique character: Late Victorian; Transitional style of bungalow between late Victorian and Craftsman; Bungalows with Greek Revival, Tudor or Craftsman detailing; American Four Square; and Queen Anne. These residential structures generally exhibit the following significant characteristics: small rectangular shaped lots; houses which are generally situated near the front centers of these lots and stand back a uniform distance from the streets; and, due to the hilly topography, many houses with low retaining walls at the sidewalk and with steps which lead up from the sidewalk. The purpose of the following regulations is to set forth basic, minimum standards of architectural design and construction that are consistent with these existing historic styles of residences within the neighborhood, as the cumulative historic diversity of the built environment is a defining characteristic of this neighborhood. It is not the intent of the regulations to limit the design of new housing to replication of existing structures, but rather to foster residential design that incorporates the historic architectural elements and materials that are specific to the neighborhood in a meaningful, coherent manner. The following regulations are intended to achieve basic compatibility with these existing architectural styles while simultaneously encouraging consistent, creative designs that are more than a mere aggregation of random historic elements, through the use of specific standards and criteria. In addition, these regulations are intended to integrate the aesthetic and physical characteristics of new construction and landscape in this area into the existing neighborhood and public park areas in a meaningful way so as to restore and promote the public health, safety and welfare of the community. (3)  Standards and criteria. The following standards and criteria shall apply to all new construction in the residential subareas: a.  All new construction on each vacant lot shall be representative of a single architectural style chosen from those styles set forth in subsection (2) above. b.  A paved walkway from the front sidewalk to the front entry of the principal structure shall be provided. c.  All front façades, front porches, front steps, and front doors of the principal structure shall face and be parallel to the street. d.  The form and pitch of the roof of new construction shall be substantially proportional to the chosen architectural style. e.  The height, scale and massing of new construction shall be substantially proportional to the chosen architectural style. In no case shall the height of a structure exceed 35 feet.

These regulations shall supplant existing districts or portions of existing districts as shown on the attached map referenced in section 16-18I.003; further provided however that: 1.  Any zoning or special use permit conditions associated with the previous zoning for any parcel within the SPI-9 District shall continue in full force and effect. Such conditions shall be incorporated as a condition of the SPI-9 zoning for such parcels. Where the SPI-9 regulations impose no standard or impose a less strict standard than that set forth in any condition incorporated from a previous zoning, the SPI-9 zoning shall not be construed to have removed such condition; and 2.  All existing categories of historic protection designated pursuant to Chapter 20 of Part 16 shall continue in full force and effect and said existing historic protection regulations shall be overlaid upon, and shall be imposed in addition to, the regulations set forth in this chapter. Whenever the following regulations are at variance with said existing historic protection regulations, the historic protection regulations shall prevail. (Ord. No. 2010-54(10-O-1339), § 1(Att. A), 10-13-10) 
Sec. 16-18I.002. - Statement of intent.     The intent of the council in establishing the SPI-9 Buckhead Village Special Public Interest District is as follows: 1.  To encourage the redevelopment of properties within the Buckhead Village consistent with the community vision established in the City of Atlanta Comprehensive Development Plan, the 1999 Vision for the Buckhead Village, the 2001 Buckhead LCI Plan, 2005 Buckhead Village Parking & Circulation Study, and the 2007 Piedmont Area Transportation Plan; 2.  To provide for a balanced mix of office, retail, commercial, residential and related uses within the SPI-9 District so as to serve the needs of the Buckhead community, surrounding residential neighborhoods, and specialty shoppers and visitors; 3.  To provide for appropriate transitions from the high intensity areas along Peachtree Road to the mixed-use character of the surrounding village areas and the lower density residential neighborhoods that border the district and to prevent incompatible commercial uses and parking in residential neighborhoods; 4.  To implement the community vision through the provision of specific graphic standards to provide a pleasing, cohesive urban aesthetic for the district through vibrant, quality design; 5.  To ensure the safe and convenient movement of pedestrians within Buckhead Village through the provision of adequate and accommodating streetscapes and to reduce pedestrian and vehicular conflicts by providing clear delineated streetscapes for pedestrian movement; 6.  To reduce auto dependency and create opportunities for increasing the use of alternative transportation modes thereby mitigating traffic congestion, noise, and other negative impacts that detract from the village and surrounding neighborhoods; 7.  To increase connectivity for all transportation modes within the district and between the district and other areas; 8.  To provide a cooperative means for meeting parking needs within the village; 9.  To create incentives for the provision of public facilities and functional, publicly-accessible open spaces; 10.  To encourage and implement environmentally-responsible development; 11.  To provide a range of housing types to meet varying housing needs; and 12.  To make more predictable, streamline, and expedite the permitting process for developments meeting the intent and requirements of the district regulations. (Ord. No. 2010-54(10-O-1339), § 1(Att. A), 10-13-10)

Sec. 16-18I.004. - Graphic appendix and standards.     The SPI-9 Buckhead Village Special Public Interest Graphic Appendix and Standards are hereby adopted and made part of this ordinance and shall apply to property in the SPI-9 District. In cases of a conflict between the Design Standards and the text of this section, the text of this section shall govern. (Ord. No. 2010-54(10-O-1339), § 1(Att. A), 10-13-10) 
Sec. 16-18I.005. - Application procedures and permits. 1.  Special administrative permit (SAP) application: a.  An SAP application and a specified number of copies each of a site plan, landscape plan, and elevation drawings of each exterior façade shall be submitted, as applicable, and approved by the director of the office of planning prior to an applicant filing for a building permit. All exterior demolition, new construction (including additions to existing buildings), modifications of outdoor dining, or any construction which results in increased lot coverage, modification of the building footprint, or modification of building façades that alters the configuration of openings at sidewalk-level, shall be subject to said SAP approval. b.  An applicant shall arrange a conference to discuss the application and the requirements of this chapter with the director or their designee either prior or subsequent to SAP submittal provided that such meeting shall be held within 14 days of the date of the request by the applicant, unless a longer period is mutually agreed upon. All SAP applications shall be processed in accordance with the standards and procedures applicable to SAP applications contained in section 16-25 except as otherwise modified by this Chapter 18I. c.  Where regulations require the approval of an SAP for purposes other than those so specified, processing by the director of the office of planning or the director's designee shall include consideration of other special administrative permits, without additional application. Where regulations require variance, special exception, rezoning, or special use permit action, the SAP for building permit purposes shall not be issued until the necessary approval has been obtained for such action. 2.  Reserved. 3.  Administrative variations: As part of general action when plans require approval of an SAP, the director of the office of planning or the director's designee may authorize variations from regulations generally applying based on written findings, to be filed as a public record, that either: a.  A plan proposed by an applicant, while not strictly in accordance with regulations applying generally within the district, satisfies the public purposes and intent of such regulations, and provides public protection to an equivalent or greater degree than strict enforcement of such regulations would provide; or b.  In the particular circumstances of the case, strict application of a particular regulation or regulations is not necessary for the accomplishment of public purposes or the provision of public protection, at that time or in the future. 4.  Variances and special exceptions: Administrative variations shall not be authorized to be granted for any of the following requirements, whereas instead, such relief shall only be authorized by action of the board of zoning adjustment (BZA): a.  A reduction of required transitional height planes or transitional yards where the boundaries of SPI-9 adjoin any residential district outside of SPI-9 without an intervening street; b.  A reduction of open space requirements as specified in these SPI-9 regulations; c.  A reduction of public access or public spaces as specified in these SPI-9 regulations; and d.  An increase of the maximum height as specified in these SPI-9 regulations. 5.  Floor area ratio and the application of bonuses. The FAR for each parcel within SPI-9 shall be as depicted on Map Attachment A except where modified by any zoning or special use permit condition. Where the Official Zoning Map would allow FAR different than the FAR shown on Map Attachment A, the FAR shown on Map Attachment A shall control provided, however, that Map Attachment A shall not control any zoning or special use permit condition. The FAR allowed in SPI-9 may be increased by the application of bonuses as set forth in these regulations provided, however, that amendments to the Official Zoning Map allowing a parcel additional FAR above the existing FAR for that parcel by the application of such bonuses shall be made in as set forth in section 16-27.001 et seq. for a change in condition of zoning with the following modifications: a.  The application shall include calculations showing the current permitted FAR and the proposed FAR and the type of bonus which is to be applied to increase the FAR to the proposed level; b.  The impact analysis for the proposed increase in FAR by this change of condition with respect to each of the matters enumerated in section 1627.004 shall discuss the effect of the increased FAR rather than the impact which would be associated with proposed change in a zoning classification; and c.  The public notice issued pursuant to 16-27.007 shall include existing FAR, proposed FAR, the proposed maximum allowable FAR and the type of bonus which is to be applied to allow the increase of FAR to the proposed level. (Ord. No. 2010-54(10-O-1339), § 1(Att. A), 10-13-10; Ord. No. 2018-11(18-O-1023), § 9.C, 5-16-18 )

The director shall maintain public records of future block area alterations or recalculations authorized by SAP consistent with SPI-12 requirements, and shall periodically update the block area map to reflect said changes. c.  Peachtree Frontage Area. An additional building height of 75 feet shall be permitted when located within the Peachtree Frontage Area as demarcated on Map Attachment "C". d.  Transit Station Area. An additional building height of 100 feet shall be permitted when located within the Transit Station Area as demarcated on Map Attachment "C". e.  Combined height. i.  Maximum total building height shall be the sum of subsections 3(a), 3(b), 3(c) and 3(d) above, provided that said sum shall not exceed 600 feet, except as provided below. ii.  Architectural features, with no habitable elements, may exceed the maximum total building height limitations. Such features shall not exceed a maximum height of 60 feet above the height otherwise authorized in subsection 3(e)(i) above. iii.  lncentivized developments may exceed the maximum total building height limitations. Such features shall not exceed a maximum height greater than the sum of subsections 3(a), 3(b), 3(c) and 3(d) above and those heights set forth for incentivized developments in section 16-18L.020. 4.  [Building heights in subarea 3:] Building heights in subarea 3 shall not exceed a maximum of 35 feet. 5.  Transitional height planes. a.  No portion of any structure shall protrude through a height limiting plane beginning the specified number of feet above the point set forth in subsection 16-18L.007(5)(b) below and extending inward over the SPI-12 district at an angle of 45 degrees. The following districts shall be considered "protected districts" for purposes of this section 16-18L.007(5): i.  R-1 through R-5; ii.  RG-1 and RG-2; iii.  MR-1, MR-2, and MR-MU; and iv.  Landmark, Historic, PD, and SPI districts and district subareas having uses and densities predominantly similar to those permitted in the district classifications listed in subsections (i) through (iii) above. b.  Proximity to districts and measurement applications: i.  For parcels in an SPI-12 district that are contiguous to a protected district, the transitional height plane shall be measured beginning 35 feet above the required SPI-12 setback or transitional yard adjoining the common property line with such protected district. ii.  For parcels in an SPI-12 district that are not contiguous to but are within 150 feet of a protected district, the transitional height plane shall be measured beginning 15 feet above the nearest lot line of the protected district, provided this transitional height plane shall not extend more than 150 linear feet (measured along the ground) from the protected district up to and into the SPI-12 district. (See diagrams at section 16-29.001(62).) c.  The purpose and intent of this provision is to provide protection for the named protected districts from nearby looming structures regardless of the presence of an intervening public right-of-way or park or space, public or private street or alley, or any lot or parcel remnant. d.  Transitional height plane measurements shall be applied to parcels on a point-by-point basis and not average grade. 6.  Future connectivity. Any buildings shall be designed so as not to prohibit or obstruct the ability for future inter-parcel access and connectivity notwithstanding the provisions of section 16-28.006(10) except where the director determines that such connectivity is impractical due to topographic or other site-specific constraints. This provision shall not be interpreted to prohibit or restrict that which would otherwise be permitted within this district or require inter-parcel rights to be granted to adjacent property owners. 7.  Sunlight preservation. Tower level building footprints (for portions of buildings 125 feet in height or greater) shall not exceed 65 percent of the sidewalk level building footprint. In no case, however, shall these tower level building footprints be required to be less than 30,000 square feet. _____ TABLE 2: SPI 12 BUCKHEAD/LENOX STATIONS DEVELOPMENT CONTROLS TABLE SUBAREA 1 SUBAREA 2 SUBAREA 3 Total FAR, maximum a NA a NA 0.40 Front yard, minimum (feet) b NA b NA b NA Side and rear yard, minimum (feet) No minimum No minimum 20′ INDEX/FOOTNOTES NON-RESIDENTIAL USES (COMMERCIAL AND RETAIL USES)   a  Not Applicable in Subareas 1 and 2.

Sec. 16-18P.004. - Application procedures. 1.  A Special Administrative Permit (SAP) application and a specified number of copies each of a site plan, landscape plan, and elevation drawings of each exterior façade shall be submitted, as applicable, and approved by the Office of Zoning and Development prior to filing for a building permit. All exterior demolition, new construction (including additions to existing buildings), new or expanded outdoor dining, or work which results in increased lot coverage, modification of the building footprint, or modification of building façades that would reduce the configuration of street facing openings, shall be subject to said SAP approval. All applications for a SAP shall be processed in accordance with the standards and procedures applicable to said SAP applications contained in chapter 25 of part 16 except as otherwise modified by this chapter 18P. No SAP shall be issued until after such time any other required Special Use Permit or Board of Zoning Adjustment action has been obtained. 2.  Administrative variations: As part of general action when plans require approval of an SAP, the Office of Zoning and Development may authorize variations from regulations generally applying based on written findings, to be filed as a public record, that either: a.  A plan proposed by an applicant, while not strictly in accordance with regulations applying generally within the district, satisfies the public purposes and intent of such regulations, and provides public protection to an equivalent or greater degree than strict enforcement of such regulations would provide; or b.  In the particular circumstances of the case, strict application of a particular regulation or regulations is not necessary for the accomplishment of public purposes or the provision of public protection, at that time or in the future. c.  Notwithstanding any provision in this chapter or part to the contrary, no administrative variation shall be authorized for those listed in section 16-18P.005 for the Board of Zoning Adjustments. 3.  The Office of Zoning and Development may exempt certain classes of applications for SAPs from detailed review requirements as set forth upon written findings that generally within these districts, the actions proposed are of such a character or scale as to make detailed reviews and approval unnecessary. Where applications for special administrative permits are determined by reference to such findings to be thus exempted, the permit shall be issued if otherwise lawful. 4.  For the purposes of this chapter, a unified development plan approved under a single SAP and meeting all floor area ratio requirements, open space requirements, and off-street parking requirements, may be subdivided, even if the resultant parcels do not otherwise meet these requirements. Any changes from the approved SAP shall require a new or amended SAP, which shall be based on the geographic extent of the original SAP and shall meet floor area ratio requirements, open space requirements, and off-street parking requirements of such; and shall indicate built or planned improvements on the original parcel(s). Where a single property owner no longer owns all parcels, the applicant shall obtain authorization from all property owners prior to permit submittal. ( Ord.

Sec. 16-18R.004. - Application procedures.     A special administrative permit (SAP) application and seven copies each of a site plan, landscape plan and elevation drawings of each exterior façade shall be submitted, as applicable, and approved by the director of the bureau of planning prior to an applicant filing for a building permit. All exterior demolition, new construction (including additions to existing buildings), expansions of existing outdoor dining, outdoor dining within required sidewalk areas, or any construction which results in increased lot coverage, modification of the building footprint, or modification of building façades that alters the configuration of openings, shall be subject to said site plan and building elevation approval. Before making an application for a special administrative permit, a pre-application conference between the applicant and the director of the bureau of planning or the director's designee is required to discuss the application and relevant requirements of these regulations. Said pre-application conference shall be held within 14 days of the date of the request by the applicant, unless a longer period is mutually agreed upon. All applications for a SAP shall be processed in accordance with the standards and procedures applicable to said SAP applications contained in Chapter 25 of Part 16 except as otherwise modified by this Chapter 18.     Where regulations may require the approval of a SAP for other purposes so specified, processing by the director of the bureau of planning shall, without additional application, include consideration of other special administrative permits. Where such regulations require special exception or special use permit action, the special administrative permit for building permit purposes shall not be issued until the necessary approval has been obtained for special exception or special use permit.     The director of the bureau of planning may exempt certain classes of applications for special administrative permits from detailed review requirements as set forth upon written findings that generally within these districts, the actions proposed are of such a character or of such a scale as to make detailed reviews and approval by the planning director unnecessary. Where applications for special administrative permits are determined by reference to such findings to be thus exempted, the permit shall be issued if otherwise lawful. (Ord.

Sec. 16-18R.007. - Transitional uses and yards. 1.  Adjoining lot in same frontage: Where a lot in this district abuts a lot in any R-1 through R-G, MR, PD-H district, or SPI-18 Subareas 4, 5, 6, and 10 at the side along the same street frontage, and without an intervening street, such lot within this district, or the first 100 feet on such lot if it is wider than 100 feet, shall not be used for any drive-in facility, car wash, service station, repair garage, or paint and body shop even where otherwise specifically authorized. 2.  Transitional height planes . a.  No portion of any structure shall protrude through a height limiting plane beginning the specified number of feet above the point set forth in subsection 16-18R.007(1)(b) below and extending inward over the SPI-18 district at an angle of 45 degrees. The following districts shall be considered "protected districts" for purposes of this section 16-18R.007(1): i.  R-1 through R-5; ii.  RG-1 and RG-2; iii.  MR-1, MR-2, and MR-MU; and iv.  Landmark, Historic, PD, and SPI districts and district subareas having uses and densities predominantly similar to those permitted in the district classifications listed in subsections (i) through (iii) above. b.  Proximity to districts and measurement applications: i.  For parcels in an SPI-18 district that are contiguous to a protected district, the transitional height plane shall be measured beginning 35 feet above the required SPI-18 setback or transitional yard adjoining the common property line with such protected district. ii.  For parcels in an SPI-18 district that are not contiguous to but are within 150 feet of a protected district, the transitional height plane shall be measured beginning 15 feet above the nearest lot line of the protected district, provided this transitional height plane shall not extend more than 150 linear feet (measured along the ground) from the protected district up to and into the SPI-18 district. (See diagrams at section 16-29.001(62).) c.  The purpose and intent of this provision is to provide protection for the named protected districts from nearby looming structures regardless of the presence of an intervening public right-of-way or park or space, public or private street or alley, or any lot or parcel remnant. d.  Transitional height plane measurements shall be applied to parcels on a point-by-point basis and not average grade. 3.  Transitional yards: a.  Where SPI-18 Subareas 1, 2, 3 and 9 adjoin an R-1 through R-G, or PD-H district or SPI-18 Subareas 4, 5 and 6 without an intervening street, a minimum of 20 feet is required which shall not be used for the purpose of parking, paving, loading, servicing or any other activity with the exception of private alleys or drives a maximum of ten feet in width. Where SPI-18 Subareas 7 and 8 adjoin an R-1 through R-G, or PD-H district or SPI-18 Subareas 4, 5 and 6 without an intervening street, a minimum of 20 feet is required which shall not be used for the purpose of parking, paving, loading, servicing or any other activity. Such yards shall be planted as approved by the city arborist and maintained as a landscaped strip. b.  Where SPI-18 Subarea 3 adjoins SPI-18 Subarea 4 no transitional yard or permanent opaque wall are required when redevelopment occurs as part of a single development. c.  Screening: In addition to the above transitional yard requirements, permanent opaque walls six feet in height shall be provided and shall be maintained in sightly condition. (Ord. No. 2007-67(07-O-1792), § 1(Att. A), 11-13-07; Ord. No. 2019-09(18-O-1581), § 10.15, 1-31-19 ) 
Sec. 16-18R.008. - Development controls.     See SPI-18 Mechanicsville: Development Controls Table for Bulk Limitations, Maximum Building Coverage, Public Space Requirements, and Minimum Open Space Requirements.     For purposes of this chapter, and notwithstanding the provisions of code section 16-29.001(24), mixed-use development is defined as any development which contains as principal uses both residential and non-residential uses on the same development site, and in which each of such uses constitute at least 20 percent of the total floor area, excluding accessory uses. When either the total non-residential or residential floor area of a development is less than 20 percent of the total floor area, minimum residential useable open space requirements (UOSR) or public space requirements (PSR) shall not apply to said floor area. 1.  Residential uses may utilize net lot area (NLA) or gross lot area (GLA) when calculating maximum permitted residential floor area, provided that useable open space requirements (UOSR) are calculated based on the same lot area. 2.  Affordable new sales housing units or rental housing units requirements: a.  Affordable workforce housing bonus: All or portion of the non-residential floor area ratio (FAR) may be utilized for residential purposes as indicated in SPI-18 Mechanicsville: Development Controls Table, provided that 20 percent or more affordable sales or rental housing units are provided for that portion of residential units resulting from said utilization. b.  The mix of affordable studio, one bedroom, two bedroom, and three bedroom units shall be proportionally similar to the percentage bedroom mix in the overall development. The size of each affordable unit shall not be smaller than the smallest unit for each unit type in the overall development. Said units shall be distributed evenly throughout the development and or building. c.  Affordable workforce housing shall have the maximum price or maximum rent set forth for moderate income housing units as defined in Part 19, Chapter 1, section 19-1006. d.  Affordable workforce housing requirements shall be in place for a minimum of 15 years from the date of issuance of the occupancy permit and shall include deed restrictions governing the value or rental rate placed on the affordable units. e.  No housing unit associated with a development project for which bonus FAR calculations were applied shall be issued an occupancy permit until such time as documentation is provided to the bureau of buildings establishing that the affordable workforce housing requirements have been met and have been instituted as part of the warranty deed as an allowable exception to title for each affordable workforce unit that is a part of said development project. 3.  Minimum open space requirements. There are no total open space requirements (TOSR): a.  For residential uses, including all residential components of mixed use developments: i.  Open space requirements as indicated on Table I, "Land Use Intensity Ratios" shall be required for UOSR only, subject to additional requirements contained in subsection ii below for Subarea 10. ii.  In Subarea 10, when a development spans public streets or contains non-contiguous parcels, credit for provided useable open space may be transferred offsite to parcels within the development, provided that: 1)  Both parcels are within SPI 18 Subarea 10; and 2)  Said open space is in excess of the minimum open space required for the donor parcel; and 3)  Said open space is constructed at the same time as the residential components to which it is credited. b.  For nonresidential uses, including all non-residential components of mixed-use developments: Public Space requirements shall be as indicated in SPI-18 Mechanicsville: Development Controls Table. See section 16-28.012 for definitions and measurements. Required yards, sidewalks and supplemental zone widths that are constructed on private property may be counted towards this requirement. Such public space may include planted areas, fountains, community gardens, parks plazas, hardscape elements related to sidewalks and plazas, and similar features located on private property. c.  For mixed-uses: The sum of minimum open space requirements specified in subsections a. and b. above for non-residential and residential shall be met. d.  All buildings and structures built before 1950 shall have no Useable Open Space requirements or Public Space Requirements, provided that additions that increase the building footprint by more than ten percent of the pre-1950 footprint shall be subject to said requirements and that the entire development lot and floor area shall be used in determining these requirements. e.  Residential balconies: Balconies for residential units, which are enclosed on not more than three sides, may be counted towards UOSR for a maximum depth of six feet. 4.  Yards and supplemental zones: shall be as indicated in SPI-18 Mechanicsville: Development Controls Table. 5.  For additional subarea requirements see SPI-18 Mechanicsville: Development Controls Table. (Ord.

Sec. 16-18U.002. - Statement of intent.     The intent of the council in establishing SPI-21 Historic West End/Adair Park Special Public Interest District as a zoning district is as follows: 1.  Implement provisions of the Comprehensive Development Plan incorporating certain recommendations contained in studies of this area, including the comprehensive study known as Historic West End Historic District Livable Centers Initiative (LCI) Plan; 2.  Create an urban environment in the commercial area of the West End where people can live, work, meet and play; 3.  Encourage the development and redevelopment of the underutilized industrial properties along Murphy Avenue in Adair Park in a commercially-viable manner that also ensures that future redevelopment provides net positive benefits to the physical environment of the Adair Park community and encourages the growth of a healthy, pedestrian-oriented, transit-supportive neighborhood; 4.  Improve the aesthetics of the built environment; 5.  Encourage a compatible mixture of residential, commercial, cultural and recreational uses; 6.  Provide a range of housing types and prices to meet different housing needs; 7.  Provide appropriately-scaled, continuous pedestrian oriented uses and activities adjacent to sidewalks along streets with identified pedestrian needs; 8.  Facilitate safe, pleasant and convenient pedestrian circulation and minimize conflict between pedestrians and vehicles; 9.  Provide for development within this area that is compatible with existing low-and moderate-density development within surrounding residential areas; 10.  Prevent encroachment of incompatible commercial uses into residential neighborhoods; 11.  Ensure pedestrian-oriented building forms; 12.  Encourage infill and rehabilitation development within traditionally commercial areas that include proportionately significant residential uses; 13.  Provide sufficient parking in an unobtrusive manner; 14.  Encourage the use of transit through the location of mixed-use development and regional entertainment and cultural facilities around a transit-oriented center; 15.  Encourage opportunities for economic development, both residential and commercial, where there is a planned relationship between the transportation system and development; 16.  Maximize opportunities for pedestrian amenities, including parks, plazas, greenways and public art; 17.  Provide sufficient, safe and accessible parks, plazas and greenways for active and passive enjoyment; 18.  Reduce parking requirements by encouraging shared parking and alternative modes of transportation; 19.  Encourage development that reflects the village's original scale; 20.  Recognize that certain subareas are more attractive to development than others at different times in the development lifecycle, and to not impose onerous requirements on subareas that might prohibit redevelopment; and 21.  Address needs for accessibility, safety, and economic development of the Adair Park neighborhood and commercial/transitional districts that are in close proximity to the West End MARTA Rail station and Murphy Avenue. (Ord. No. 2005-51, § 1(Att. A), 8-22-05)

When any portion of a lot is within the applicable distance, the entire lot shall be considered within the zone.  (Ord. No. 2005-51, § 1(Att. A), 8-22-05; Ord. No. 2019-09(18-O-1581), § 7.L, 1-31-19 ) 
Sec. 16-18U.004. - Application procedures.     A special administrative permit shall be required for development in this district as set forth in this section. A special administrative permit (SAP) application and seven copies each of a site plan, landscape plan and elevation drawings of each exterior façade shall be submitted and approved by the director of the bureau of planning prior to the applicant filing for a building permit. All new construction, including additions to existing buildings, expansions of existing outdoor dining, outdoor dining within required sidewalk areas, or any construction which results in increased lot coverage or a modification of the building footprint within this district, shall be subject to said site plan review and approval. Before making application for a special administrative permit, a pre-application conference between the applicant and the director of the bureau of planning or the director's designee is required to discuss the application and relevant requirements of these regulations. Said pre-application conference shall be held within 14 days of the date of the request by the applicant, unless a longer period is mutually agreed upon. All applications for a special administrative permit shall be processed in accordance with the standards and procedures applicable to said SAP applications contained in Chapter 25 of Part 16 except as otherwise modified by this Chapter 18U. (Ord. No. 2005-51, § 1(Att. A), 8-22-05) 
Sec. 16-18U.005. - Exemption from special application permit.     Exemption from the special application permit process will be considered for applications requesting general repairs or renovations, based on the following conditions:     In all subareas: 1.  There are no exterior additions to existing buildings; 2.  There are no expansions of existing outdoor dining or outdoor dining within required sidewalk areas; 3.  There is no construction which results in increased lot coverage or a modification of any building footprint; and     In Subareas 1 through 8: 4.  There are no alterations to any exterior building façades visible from the public right-of-way that reduce the number or amount of window openings or doors, alter façade materials, or decrease the height of the façade. In addition, the director of the bureau of planning may exempt certain classes of applications for building permits from detailed review requirements as set forth above upon written findings that generally within SPI districts, the actions proposed are of such a character or of such a scale as to make detailed reviews and approval by the planning director unnecessary. Where applications for building permits are determined by reference to such findings to be thus exempted, the permit shall be issued if otherwise lawful. 5.  Battery exchange stations shall be permitted where service stations are permitted. (Ord. No. 2005-51, § 1(Att. A), 8-22-05; Ord. No. 2014-53(14-O-1278), § 2(Attach. B), 12-10-14 ) 
Sec. 16-18U.006. - Variations.     In connection with the issuance of special administrative permits as is provided herein, the director of the bureau of planning is authorized to receive and decide requests for variations either as is provided at section 16-18.007 within this part or, alternatively, pursuant to the following standards: (1)  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, topography, subsurface conditions, overhead structures or the existence of sufficient trees in the public right-of-way within ten feet of the property line; (2)  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and (3)  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Atlanta. The director of the bureau of planning is also authorized to receive and decide requests for a reduction of the required on-site parking for properties located in the reduced parking zone, to a maximum reduction of 100 percent of the regular onsite parking requirements given in this section. Parking reductions may be based upon consideration of such factors as adequacy of the existing pedestrian infrastructure, age of the structure, urban design features of the structure, local pedestrian accessibility and connectivity, and proposed use for the site. (Ord. No. 2005-51, § 1(Att. A), 8-22-05)

CHAPTER 19. - PD PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS 
Sec. 16-19.001. - Statement of intent.     The intent of this chapter in establishing the PD Planned Development Districts is as follows: (1)  To create new planned development districts for specialized purposes where tracts are suitable in location, area and character for development on a unified basis. This suitability shall be determined primarily by reference to the comprehensive development plan, with due consideration given to the existing and prospective character of surrounding development. (2)  To relate the general development pattern and objectives of the comprehensive development plan so as to provide for the comfort and convenience of occupants and facilitate protection of the character of surrounding neighborhoods. (3)  To reduce automotive traffic congestion by a reasonably close relationship between origins and destinations of persons living, working or visiting in such development. (4)  To relate by physical proximity, major street networks, or by mass transit, housing, commercial and service facilities and principal places of employment. (5)  To promote economical and efficient land use, an improved level of amenities, appropriate and harmonious variety, creative design and a better environment for both large-scale and smaller developments. (Code 1977, § 16-19.001) 
Sec. 16-19.002. - "Planned development" defined.     For purposes of these regulations, a planned development is: (a)  Land under unified control, to be planned and developed as a whole; (b)  In a single development operation or a definitely programmed series of development operations, including all land and buildings; (c)  For principal and accessory structures and uses substantially related to the character and purposes of the district; (d)  According to comprehensive and detailed plans which include not only streets, utilities, lots or building sites and the like, but also site plans, for all buildings to be constructed; (e)  With a program for provision, operation and maintenance of such areas, facilities and improvements proposed for common use by some or all of the occupants of the district, but will not be provided, operated or maintained at general public expense. (Code 1977, § 16-19.002) 
Sec. 16-19.003. - Relation of PD regulations to subdivision or other regulations; variations on equal satisfaction of public purposes.     The planned development regulations which follow shall apply generally to the initiation and regulation of all planned development districts.

Sec. 16-19.004. - PD districts: Where and how permitted. (1)  Planned development districts may hereafter be established by amendment to the official zoning map and related amendatory action where tracts suitable in location and character for the uses and structures proposed are to be planned and developed on a unified basis, according to the requirements and procedures set forth herein. (2)  PD districts shall be appropriately located with respect to intended functions, to the pattern and timing of development existing or proposed in the comprehensive development plan, and to all necessary public and private facilities which must be existing or clearly be available by the time the development reaches the stage where they will be needed. All requirements specified in Chapter 27, "Amendments," shall be met, as well as the following specific requirements. (3)  PD districts, other than PD-H on five (5) acres or less, shall be so located with respect to expressways, arterial and collector streets or mass transit facilities, and shall be so designed as to provide direct access to such districts without creating traffic along minor streets in residential neighborhoods outside the planned development district. (Code 1977, § 16-19.004) 
Sec. 16-19.005. - Procedures on PD amendments. (1)  Site Development Requirements: (a)  The site shall be suitable for development in the manner proposed without hazards to persons or property, on or off the tract, from probability of flooding, erosion, subsidence or slipping of the soil, or other dangers, annoyances or inconveniences. Condition of soil groundwater level, drainage and topography shall be appropriate to both kind and pattern of use intended. (b)  If appropriate to the form of planned development, land to be included in PD districts may be divided by streets, alleys, rights-of-way or easements, but shall be so located, dimensioned and arranged as to permit unified planning and development and to meet all requirements in connection therewith, as well as to provide necessary protection against adverse relationships between uses in the district and uses in surrounding areas. (2)  Applications; Materials To Be Submitted: Applications for PD amendments shall be submitted as for other amendments. Material submitted with the application or on subsequent request by the bureau of planning shall include plans, maps, studies and reports which may reasonably be required to make the determinations called for in the particular case and to include the items designated below and with sufficient copies for necessary referrals and records, as provided in the rules of the bureau. (a)  Location of tract or parcel by vicinity map at a scale of not less than one (1) inch equals 2000 feet, and landmarks sufficient to property identify the location of the property. (b)  An accurate and current boundary survey of the tract by a registered surveyor or professional engineer. (c)  Existing and proposed roads, indicating rights-of-way, easements and utilities; watercourses and their names; present use of any structure. (d)  Location of ingress and egress to the site with dimensions. (e)  Existing topography accurately shown with a maximum of five-foot contour intervals at a scale of not less than 50 feet to the inch. Other maximum intervals may be required by the bureau of planning where topographic considerations warrant. (f)  Floodplain limits as adopted by the City of Atlanta. (g)  A report identifying all property owners within the area of the proposed district giving evidence of unified control of its entire area. The report shall state agreement of all present property owners and/or their prospective successors in title to proceed with the proposed development according to the regulations in effect when the map amendment creating the PD district is passed, with such modifications as are set by the council in the course of such action. (h)  A report establishing a program for guaranteeing maintenance of all common areas, including open space and streets, through condominium association, homeowner association, bonding or other protective maintenance guarantees. (3)  Preliminary Review of Application as Submitted: On receipt of the application and preliminary concept plan and detailed proposals as indicated above, the director, bureau of planning shall cause a study to be made by qualified representatives of the bureau of planning and such other agencies or officials as appear appropriate in the circumstances of the case to determine conformity with the comprehensive development plan, and to zoning and other regulations applicable in the case. (4)  Preliminary Conferences With Applicants: Following such study, unless complete conformity is found, the applicant shall be notified in writing of discrepancies, and of the willingness of the bureau to confer for the purpose of assisting him in bringing the material submitted as nearly as possible into conformity with requirements and/or to define specifically modification of regulations or of the comprehensive development plan which seems justified in view of equivalent service of public purposes by the proposal.     If the applicant does not desire to participate in such conferences, the bureau shall base its report to the zoning review board and council on the application as received.     If the applicant joins in such a conference, changes may be made in the original proposal, further conferences may be held, and additional material may be requested to guide in determinations.     In the course of such preliminary conferences, any recommendations for changes shall be recorded in writing, with reasons therefor, and shall be transmitted to the zoning review board. (5)  Bureau of Planning Recommendations: The planning bureau shall process applications for planned development as any other zoning amendment, and the findings of fact shall address the following: (a)  The suitability of the tract for the general type of PD zoning proposed, physical characteristics of the land, and relation of the proposed development to surrounding areas and existing and probable future development. (b)  The relationship to major roads and mass transit facilities, utilities and other facilities and services when so required. (c)  The evidence of unified control. (d)  The suitability of plans proposed or the desirability of amendments. (e)  The desirable specific modifications in PD or general regulations as applied to the particular case, based on determination that such modifications are necessary or justified in the particular case by demonstration that the public purposes of PD or other regulations would be met to at least an equivalent degree by such modifications. (f)  The suitability of a program of maintenance for any common area.     Based on such findings, the bureau of planning shall recommend approval of the PD amendment as proposed, approval conditional on stipulated modifications, or disapproval, with recorded reasons therefor. (6)  Actions by Zoning Review Board; Council: Actions by the zoning review board and the council shall be as provided for amendments generally. The zoning review board may recommend the application in accord with PD and other regulations applicable, may include recommended modifications of PD or other applicable regulations as provided in subsection (5)(e) above, or may recommend denial of the application.     If the amendment is granted, the council shall, in its amending action, approve the development concept plan or indicate required modifications; and such approved plan, with required modifications, if any, shall be binding in determinations concerning final development plans.     If the planned development district is granted, the development shall be required to be in accord with final development plans meeting the requirements of these and other regulations, as modified by the council in the case of an amending action, and shall conform to any time limitations established by the council on beginning and completion of the development as a whole, or in specified stages. (7)  Bureau of Planning Action: (a)  Approval of final plans: After a PD district has been established, no building permit shall be issued therein unless and until the bureau of planning has approved final plans and reports for the development as a whole or stages or portions thereof deemed satisfactory in relation to the total development. The form and content of such final plans and reports shall be as prescribed in zoning, subdivision regulations, or other regulations, generally or for particular PD districts, and in the rules of the bureau of planning and other affected agencies.     Approval of final plans and reports shall be based on compliance with regulations applying at the time the land was zoned to PD status, including such specific modifications as were made by the council in its amending action.     Upon approval of final plans and reports, building permits shall be issued in the same manner as for building permits generally, provided that any requirements concerning the order and location in which building permits are to be issued in the particular PD district shall be observed. Except as provided below, final plans and reports approved shall be binding on the applicants and any successors in title so long as PD zoning applies to the land. (b)  Bureau of planning action on modification of final plans: Changes in approved final plans may be permitted by the bureau of planning on applications by the original applicant or successors in interest, but only upon making a finding that such changes are: a.  In accord with all applicable regulations in effect at the time of the amendment creating the PD district as modified in the amending action; or b.  In accord with all applicable regulations currently in effect, without modification; and c.  In accord with the approved development concept plan, including any required modifications.     Changes other than as indicated above shall be made only by new PD or other amendments. (c)  Final plan approval is an administrative action: Final plan approval is an administrative action.

Sec. 16-19A.006. - Site planning.     Site planning within the districts shall provide protection of the development from potentially adverse surrounding influences, and protection of surrounding areas from potentially adverse influences from within the development. In particular: (1)  Principal vehicular access points: Principal vehicular access points shall be designed to encourage smooth traffic flow with controlled turning movements and minimum hazards to vehicular or pedestrian traffic. Merging and turnout lanes and/or traffic dividers and extra width of the approach street shall be required where existing or anticipated heavy flows indicate need. In general, minor streets shall not be connected with streets outside the districts in such a way as to encourage use of such minor streets by substantial amounts of through traffic. (2)  Access for pedestrians and cyclists: Access for pedestrians and cyclists entering or leaving the district shall be by safe and convenient routes. Such access need not be adjacent to, or limited to the vicinity of, vehicular access points. Where there are crossings of pedestrian ways and vehicular routes at edges of planned developments, such crossings shall be safely marked and controlled; and where such ways are exposed to substantial vehicular traffic at edges of districts, safeguards may be required to prevent crossing except at designated points. (3)  Protection of visibility for automotive traffic, cyclists and pedestrians: Protection of visibility for automotive traffic, cyclists and pedestrians shall be as generally provided at section 16-28.008(9), "Visibility Clearance at Intersections." In addition, where there is pedestrian or bicycle access from within the development to a street at its edges by paths or across yards or other open space without a barrier to access to the street, no material impediment to visibility, as defined therein, shall be created or maintained within areas appropriate to the circumstances of the case, but in any event within a visibility triangle equivalent to that required at section 16-28.008(9). (4)  Yards, fences, walls or vegetative screening at edges of PD-H districts: Yards, fences, walls or vegetative screening at edges of PD-H districts shall be provided where needed to protect residents from undesirable views, lighting, noise or other off-site influences, or to protect occupants of adjoining residential districts from similar adverse influences within the PD-H district. In particular, extensive off-street parking areas and service areas for loading and unloading vehicles other than passenger, and areas for storage and collection of refuse and garbage shall be screened. (5)  Transitional height planes. (a)  No portion of any structure shall protrude through a height limiting plane beginning the specified number of feet above the point set forth in subsection 16-19A.006(5)(b) below and extending inward over the PD-MU district at an angle of 45 degrees. The following districts shall be considered "protected districts" for purposes of this section 16-19A.006(5): i.  R-1 through R-5; ii.  RG-1 and RG-2; iii.  MR-1, MR-2, and MR-MU; and iv.  Landmark, Historic, PD, and SPI districts and district subareas having uses and densities predominantly similar to those permitted in the district classifications listed in subsections (i) through (iii) above. (b)  Proximity to districts and measurement applications: i.  For parcels in a PD-MU district that are contiguous to a protected district, the transitional height plane shall be measured beginning 35 feet above the required PD-MU setback or transitional yard adjoining the common property line with such protected district. ii.  For parcels in a PD-MU district that are not contiguous to but are within 150 feet of a protected district, the transitional height plane shall be measured beginning 15 feet above the nearest lot line of the protected district, provided this transitional height plane shall not extend more than 150 linear feet (measured along the ground) from the protected district up to and into the PD-MU district. (See diagrams at section 16-29.001(62).) (c)  The purpose and intent of this provision is to provide protection for the named protected districts from nearby looming structures regardless of the presence of an intervening public right-of-way or park or space, public or private street or alley, or any lot or parcel remnant. (d)  Transitional height plane measurements shall be applied to parcels on a point-by-point basis and not average grade. (6)  Repealed. (7)  Internal relationships, site planning: The site plan shall provide for safe, efficient, convenient and harmonious groupings of structures, uses and facilities, for appropriate relation of space inside and outside buildings to intended uses and structural features, and for preservation of desirable natural features and minimum disturbance of natural topography. (a)  Streets, drives, parking and service areas: Streets, drives, parking and service areas shall provide safe and convenient access to dwelling units and general facilities, and for service and emergency vehicles. Streets shall not be so laid out as to encourage outside traffic to traverse the development on minor streets, nor occupy more land than is required to provide access as indicated, nor create unnecessary fragmentation of the development into small blocks. In general, block size shall be the maximum consistent with use and shape of the site and the convenience and safety of occupants. (b)  Vehicular access to streets: 1.  If the street or portion thereof serves 50 or less dwelling units, vehicular access from off-street parking and service areas may be directly to the streets from the sites of individual dwelling units. Determination of number of dwelling units served shall be based on normal routes of traffic anticipated in the development. 2.  Vehicular access to other streets or portions of streets: Vehicular access to other streets or portions of streets from off-street parking and service areas shall be so combined, limited, located, designed and controlled as to channel traffic from and to such areas conveniently, safely and in a manner which minimizes marginal traffic friction and promotes free flow of traffic on streets without excessive interruption. (8)  Ways for pedestrian and cyclists; use by emergency or service vehicles. Walkways shall form a logical, safe and convenient system, approved by the department of public safety for pedestrian access to all dwelling units, project facilities, and principal off-site pedestrian destinations.     Walkways to be used by substantial numbers of children and routes to school or other destinations shall be so located and safeguarded as to minimize contact with normal automotive traffic. If substantial bicycle traffic is anticipated, bicycle paths shall be coordinated with the walkway system. Street crossings shall be held to a minimum on such walkways, shall be located and designed to promote safety, and shall be appropriately marked and otherwise safeguarded. (9)  Protection of visibility for automotive traffic, cyclists and pedestrians. Protection of visibility for automotive traffic, cyclists and pedestrians shall be as provided in section 16-19A.006(3) above. (Code 1977, § 16-19A.006; Ord.

CHAPTER 20. - HC HISTORIC AND CULTURAL CONSERVATION DISTRICTS[14] Footnotes: --- (14) --- Cross reference— Historic preservation program, § 6-4041 et seq. 
Sec. 16-20.001. - Statement of intent.     Within zoning districts now existing or hereafter created, it is the intent of this chapter to permit in general areas of substantial historic, architectural, and/or cultural significance, or for individual buildings or sites designated as having such significance, the creation and regulation of the following categories of zoning protection: (1)  Landmark Buildings and Sites; (2)  Historic Buildings and Sites; (3)  Landmark Districts; (4)  Historic Districts; and (5)  Conservation Districts.     The council finds that many buildings, sites and districts as herein defined, having a special character or a special historic or aesthetic interest or value, or representing the finest architectural products of distinct periods in the history of the city, have been destroyed or uprooted, notwithstanding the feasibility of preserving and continuing the use of such buildings, sites and districts, and without adequate consideration of the irreplaceable loss to the people of the city of aesthetic, educational, economic and historic values represented by such buildings, sites and districts. In addition, distinct areas may be similarly uprooted or may have their distinctiveness destroyed, although the preservation thereof may be both feasible and desirable. It is the finding of the council that the standing of this city as the capital of government, culture, business and education and as a major tourist and convention center must be maintained and enhanced by preserving the historical and architectural heritage of the city and by preventing the destruction of such cultural assets.     It is hereby declared as a matter of public policy that the identification, protection, enhancement, perpetuation and use of buildings, sites and districts of special character or of a special historic or aesthetic interest or value is a public necessity and is required in the interest of the health, prosperity, safety, education and general welfare of the people. Accordingly, the public policy objectives of this chapter are as follows: (1)  To effect and accomplish the protection, enhancement and perpetuation of such buildings, sites and districts which represent or reflect special elements of the city's cultural, social, economic, and architectural history; (2)  To safeguard the city's historic, cultural heritage, as embodied and reflected in such buildings, sites and districts; (3)  To stabilize and improve property values in such buildings, sites and districts; (4)  To foster civic pride in the beauty and noble accomplishments of the past; (5)  To protect and enhance the city's attractions to tourists and visitors and thereby support and stimulate business and industry; (6)  To strengthen the economy of the city; (7)  To promote the use of buildings, sites and districts for the education, pleasure and general welfare of the people of the city; (8)  To promote attention to sound design principles in areas of new development and redevelopment; (9)  To raise the level of community understanding and expectation for quality in the built environment; and (10)  To implement the Comprehensive Development Plan of the City of Atlanta. (Code 1977, § 16-20.001)

Sec. 16-20.005. - Nominations. (a)  Applications. (1)  Authority to apply: Nominations initiated by the director do not require an application. Except for nominations initiated by the director, an application shall be required to begin the nomination process set forth in this section. The following persons are empowered to file an application with the director for the nomination of a building, site or district to any category of protection provided by this part: the Atlanta City Council; for buildings or sites, the owner(s) of the building or site to be nominated, or an authorized agent; for districts, the owners of at least 10 properties, or the owners of 10 percent of the total number of properties within the proposed district, whichever is less, for each proposed district. Applications required by this section shall not be construed as zoning amendment applications required in Code of Ordinances section 16-27.001 et seq. (2)  Form of application. When required as set forth above, applications for nominations shall be in the following form: Applications by the city council shall be in the form of a resolution requesting that the director initiate a nomination. Applications by property owners shall be made on forms prescribed by the director and available to the public. No such owner application shall be deemed to be complete until all supporting documentation required in the nomination process has been provided in a form prescribed by the director. Further, all owner applications shall be verified by each owner or each owner's authorized agent. (3)  Processing of application: After an application is received in proper form, the director shall begin the nomination procedures set forth in this part within a reasonable time after receipt based upon the availability of the research and information necessary for the nomination and the availability of staff resources. (b)  Initiation of Nomination Process: The process of nomination is initiated by a written notice of intent to nominate a building, site or district to any category of protection provided by this part. Said notice, which shall be prepared and mailed by the director, shall be sent by first class mail to the owner or owners of each such building or site, or in the case of districts to each individual owner of property within such district. Said notice shall describe the building, site or district proposed for nomination, including its location and/or boundaries; shall specify the category of protection to which it is proposed for nomination; shall specify the existing zoning classification, and/or boundaries, and historic protection, if any; shall state that the property could be nominated to another category of protection during the nomination process; shall announce the time, date and place of the public hearing by the commission to consider said nomination; shall include a statement notifying the property owner(s) of the automatic interim controls provided for in subsection (c) below; and shall include a copy of the interim control ordinance. In addition to the written notice of intent to nominate which initiates the nomination process, the director shall also, at least 15 but not more than 45 days prior to the hearing before the commission, cause to be published a notice within a newspaper of general circulation within the territorial boundaries of the city. This published notice shall state the time, date, place and purpose of the hearing. This published notice shall also include the location and/or boundaries of the property or properties, the existing zoning classification and historic protection, if any, the category of protection proposed, and a statement that the property could be nominated to another category of protection during the nomination process. (c)  Interim Control: (1)  Findings and purpose: The governing body finds that immediate but temporary interim controls prohibiting any alteration or demolition of any building or site for which a notice of intent to nominate has been mailed are required in furtherance of the city's comprehensive historic preservation program. Temporary preservation of the status quo is essential to effectively evaluate each proposed nomination and to allow consideration of appropriate designations of all proposed landmark or historic districts, buildings or sites, and to prevent circumvention of the intent of this part. (2)  Control regulations: Therefore, any property or properties for which a notice of intent to nominate has been mailed shall receive the full legislative protection of, and be controlled by, the regulations governing that category of protection to which said property is proposed to be nominated, as specified in this part [section] and chapter 20 of Part 16 of the Code of Ordinances governing protection and treatment of properties so categorized. Said protection shall become automatically effective without further action of any kind immediately upon the date and time that the director of the urban design commission mails the notice of intent to nominate required by subsection (b) above. Except as provided below, the period of this mandatory interim protection shall not exceed 120 days commencing on the date and time of the mailing of said notice of intent to nominate. This interim control period allows and is based upon approximately 45 days for public hearing, evaluation of, and action on the proposed nomination by the commission and approximately 75 days for public hearing and review by the zoning review board, action by the zoning committee, and final action by the city council and the mayor as specified in this part. This 120-day period may be extended by resolution of council only if said extension is due to delay in the legislative process and only for a period of time equal to any such delay, but in no event shall the total interim control period permitted by this section exceed a maximum of 180 days. (3)  Enforcement: The director of the commission shall deliver a copy of each notice of intent to nominate to the director of the bureau of buildings at or before the time and date each notice is mailed by the director of the commission. The director, bureau of buildings shall immediately take all steps necessary to accomplish the requirements of this section, and is prohibited from accepting any application or issuing any permit of any kind for any building, site or district specified in each notice of intent of nominate, unless the director of the bureau of buildings certifies that such permits are necessary due solely to unanticipated emergency public safety reasons or are approved pursuant to a valid certificate of appropriateness as provided for in this part [section] and in chapter 20 of Part 16 of the Code of Ordinances. Violations of this section shall be punishable as provided for in section 16-30.002 of the Code of Ordinances, as amended. (d)  Preparation of Report: Prior to the commission's public hearing to consider any nomination(s) to any category of protection, the director shall conduct research and compile a written report in the nature of findings and recommendations regarding the historic, architectural and/or cultural significance of each proposed nomination. This report shall include a statement on each of the following to the extent that they apply to the proposed nomination(s): 1.  The criteria upon which the nomination of the building, site or district and its boundaries is based, including a finding that the proposed nomination either does or does not meet the minimum criteria required for nomination and designation; 2.  A description of the building(s) and/or site(s), as well as features of significance, including date of construction, architect or builder, and architectural style and materials used; 3.  A description of the boundaries of each building, site or district, including any proposed transition zone, which may be in the form of either a metes and bounds description or a plat or map. For all district nominations, the proposed boundaries shall be drawn to include all contributing properties reasonably contiguous within an area. Where reasonably feasible in relation to the purpose of each district, boundaries shall include frontage on both sides of streets, and shall divide the proposed district from other districts at rear lot lines, side lot lines, or at other points where divisions will create minimum inter-district friction. Internal boundaries may subdivide the district into subareas and transition areas for regulatory purposes. All descriptions shall be attached to the written report; 4.  If the proposed district is visually related to surrounding areas in such a way that actions in the surrounding area might have potentially adverse environmental influences on the district, proposed boundaries for such transitional areas shall be shown, and shall be called transitional zones; 5.  The existing zoning classification of the proposed designation; 6.  A reference to that section of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Atlanta which permits the transfer of development rights of Landmark Buildings or Sites, or Historic Buildings or Sites; and 7.  All economic incentives which may be available to assist in the preservation of each Landmark Building or Site, or Historic Building or Site. (e)  Commission Action: (1)  Public hearing: The commission shall hold a public hearing to consider the nomination of each building, site or district proposed as a Landmark Building or Site, Historic Building or Site, Landmark District, Historic District, or Conservation District. Notice of the hearing shall be given as provided in subsection (b) of this section. The commission shall review and consider the staff report prepared pursuant to subsection (d) of this section as well as any other relevant information or documentation presented to it. The commission may solicit expert testimony regarding the historic, architectural or cultural importance of the building, site or district under consideration for nomination.     The commission shall afford to the owner or agent of any property which is being considered for nomination or any interested member of the public a reasonable opportunity to present testimony and documentation regarding the historic, architectural or cultural importance of the building, site or district proposed for nomination. (2)  Successive nominations: A two-year waiting period shall be required before a building or site can be renominated for designation to the same category from which it was disapproved by the council. (3)  Decision and transmittal: The commission shall make a decision in public with respect to each proposed nomination in the form of a written resolution within fifteen (15) days after the initial public hearing date. The resolution of nomination by the commission shall set forth those findings of fact which constitute the basis for the nomination and shall affirmatively state that the building, site or district meets or exceeds the criteria required for nomination. Upon adoption of the resolution of nomination by the commission, the director of the commission shall promptly transmit such resolution, including all supporting documentation, to the chair of the zoning committee of the city council and to the commissioner of the department of community development. The director shall also notify by first class mail the owner or owners of the property or properties which are the subject of said resolution of nomination of the decision of the commission. (Code 1977, § 16-20.005) 
Sec. 16-20.006. - Designations. (a)  Preparation of Designation Ordinance: Upon the nomination by the commission of any building, site or district to any category of protection provided by this part, the director of the urban design commission, in consultation with the bureau of planning, shall prepare a proposed zoning designation amendment accomplishing the intent of the resolution of nomination. For proposed Landmark or Historic District(s) the ordinance shall include proposed detailed regulations to be applied and which may be designed to supplant or to modify any existing regulations, including regulations pertaining to the use of land, buildings or structures within the districts, including any and all subareas of the districts according to section 16-20.005 of the Code of Ordinances. Such regulations may be drafted to require, for a particular district or its subareas, if any, certificates of appropriateness in addition to those required in section 16-20.007 of the Code of Ordinances. Such regulations may be prepared with the advice and assistance of the owner or owners of all such properties within the district, neighborhood groups, historic preservation groups, or other organizations or individuals qualified by interest, training and experience in achieving the objectives set forth in this chapter. The director shall present this proposed ordinance to the chair of the zoning committee for consideration. (b)  Zoning Committee Action: Upon receipt of a resolution of nomination and proposed designation legislation, the zoning committee shall proceed at or before its next regular meeting to act upon the proposed designation ordinance.     The zoning committee may, by majority vote, modify any nomination by the urban design commission to another category provided that the reasons for such modification by the zoning committee shall be made a part of the record of the committee proceedings. The proposed designation ordinance, along with supporting documentation, shall then be presented by the chair of the zoning committee at the next regular meeting of the city council at which time said proposed ordinance shall be referred to the zoning review board for public hearing. (c)  Public Hearing: (1)  A public hearing on each proposed designation ordinance, except for Conservation Districts, shall be held by the zoning review board. Since the adoption by the city council and approval by the mayor of an ordinance that designates a building, site or district to any category of protection provided in this part except Conservation Districts is a zoning action which establishes either (1) an overlay zoning district with accompanying district regulations and map or (2) an overlay zoning regulation, notice as is provided in this chapter shall be followed for all such designation actions; provided however, that designation of Conservation Districts, and interim protection(s) afforded any property or properties pursuant to section 16-20.005(c) of the Code of Ordinances are not zoning actions and does not require the above-referenced notice and hearing procedures. (2)  In addition to the requirements of chapter 27 of Part 16 of the Code of Ordinances relating to amendments to the zoning ordinance, and prior to action by the zoning review board on any proposed designation of a building, site or district to any category of protection permitted by the chapter, except Conservation Districts, the department of community development, through the bureau of planning, shall evaluate each such proposed designation and shall also consider the following matters: a.  City goals and policies as are contained in the comprehensive development plan; b.  Impact of proposal on transportation, urban design, other planning and development goals and objectives of the city; c.  Potential impacts of tax abatements and other financial incentives which may be available to the property owner to assist in preservation; and d.  Potential impacts of tax abatements and other financial incentives on the city budget.     In conducting such evaluation, the department of city planning shall request assistance and information from other city departments and agencies, including the department of finance, as may be appropriate to the specific proposal under construction. (d)  Final Action: After public hearing by the zoning review board, each proposed designation ordinance shall be returned to the zoning committee for action and then reported to the city council for final action. (e)  Post-Adoption Actions: (1)  Within 20 days after any designation ordinance becomes law, the director of the commission shall send to the owner or owners of record of each such property so designated, by first class mail, a copy of the ordinance, a statement of the regulations governing their property, and a statement of the economic incentive which may be available for their property. (2)  Within 20 days after any designation ordinance becomes law, the director of the commission shall send notice of such action to the following officials and agencies: a.  Commissioner of the department of city planning; b.  Commissioner of the department of public works; c.  Commissioner of the department of parks and recreation; d.  Commissioner of the department of watershed management; e.  Director, bureau of planning; f.  Director, bureau of buildings; g.  Director, bureau of housing and code compliance; h.  Police chief; i.  Fire chief; and j.  State historic preservation officer. (3)  Within 20 days of any designation ordinance becomes law, except designations of conservation districts, the director of the commission shall file in the office of the clerk of the Superior Court of Fulton County of in the office of the Clerk of the Superior Court of DeKalb County, as is appropriate to said property, a certificate of notification that such property has such designation, and said certificate of notification shall be maintained on the public records until such time as the designation may be withdrawn by the city council and mayor. (4)  The director of the commission may cause to be created a suitable plaque appropriately identifying each designated building, site or district. Such plaques shall be affixed to private property only with the written consent of the owner or owners of said property. (Code 1977, § 16-20.006; Ord. No. 2003-07, § 1, 1-28-03; Ord. No. 2003-98, § 1, 10-14-03; Ord. No. 2013-27(13-O-1088), § 4, 6-26-13; Ord. No. 2017-14(17-O-1157) , § 6, 4-26-17) 
Sec. 16-20.007. - Certificates of appropriateness; generally. (a)  When Required, Generally: In addition to other permits which are required pursuant to any city ordinance, and in addition to any certificate of appropriateness which may be required pursuant to any other landmark or historic building, site or district regulation contained in Part 16 of the Code of Ordinances, certificates of appropriateness shall, unless provided otherwise in the detailed regulations governing Landmark or Historic Districts contained within a designation ordinance as provided in section 16-20.006 of the Code of Ordinances, be required for any of the following actions within each of the following categories: (1)  Landmark buildings and sites: a.  To change the exterior appearance of any Landmark Building or Site; b.  To change the interior appearance of any Landmark Building or Site which has a designated interior; c.  To erect a new structure or to make an addition to any Landmark Building or Site; d.  To demolish or move any Landmark Building or Site in whole or in part; or e.  To vary any applicable regulation. (2)  Historic buildings and sites: a.  To change the exterior appearance of any Historic Building or Site; b.  To erect a new structure other than a replacement structure referred to in section 16-20.008(e), or to make an addition to any Historic Building or Site which is visible from the public way; or c.  To vary any applicable regulation. (3)  Landmark Districts: a.  To change the exterior appearance of any structure within any Landmark District; b.  To erect any new structure or to make an addition to any structure within a Landmark District; c.  To demolish or move any structure, in whole or in part, within a Landmark District; or d.  To vary any applicable regulation. (4)  Historic Districts: a.  To change the exterior appearance of any structure within an Historic District; b.  To erect a new structure or to make an addition to any structure within an Historic District; c.  To demolish or move any contributing structure in whole or in part, within an Historic District; or d.  To vary any applicable regulation. (b)  Conservation Districts Exempted: Certificates of appropriateness are not required for Conservation Districts. However, no person shall construct, alter, demolish or move, in whole or in part, any building, structure or site located within a Conservation District until the commission shall have reviewed the proposed action(s) and made written recommendations regarding any such action to the owner(s) of the property. Upon application of the owner of any property within any such Conservation District for a building or other development permit, the director, bureau of buildings shall promptly refer such applicant to the urban design commission. The applicant shall provide the director of the commission with complete plans regarding the permit for which application has been made, and the director of the commission shall present the plans at the next regular meeting of the urban design commission. At said meeting, the commission shall review the subject plans and shall transmit, through the director, the written recommendations of the commission regarding such permit application to the applicant, with a copy to the bureau of buildings. The recommendations shall be sent by first class mail to the owner within five days following the date of the commission review. Such recommendations constitute an advisory review only, and the owner may elect to modify plans in order to incorporate said recommendations, or may elect to proceed with the original plans for the permit application. If the commission fails to provide said written advisory comments to the owner(s) within 30 days of the owner(s) initial application to the bureau of buildings, the bureau of buildings shall issue the permit(s) at the request of the owner without compliance with this subsection. (c)  Demolition or Moving of Historic Building and Sites Exempted: A certificate of appropriateness is not required to demolish or move any Historic Building or Site. However, prior to the demolition or moving of any historic building or site, an application shall be required in accordance with the following procedures: (1)  Each applicant shall submit on the same day to both the bureau of buildings and the director of the urban design commission all applications, plans and information required by the bureau of buildings to obtain such a permit. (2)  In addition, the applicant shall submit, at the same time and in the same manner, a site plan and drawings, including elevations, indicating the floor area and height of the proposed new building and the impact of the proposed building or alteration on the historic site, as the term "building" is defined in section 16-29.001 of the Code of Ordinances, and provided that such building has a total square footage at least equal to the square footage of the footprint of the building or site proposed to be demolished or moved. (3)  The urban design commission shall have 45 days following the receipt of all materials required in subparts (1) and (2) above to renew the application and provide to the applicant written comments advising the applicant about actions which could be taken to maintain the integrity of the Historic Site. (4)  During the 45-day commission review, the bureau of buildings shall process and review the application in accordance with its usual procedures, but shall issue no permit prior to the expiration of said 45-day period. (5)  Immediately after the expiration of said 45-day commission review period of an alteration or demolition permit application, and whether or not the commission's comments are favorable, but providing that the application otherwise meets existing regulations generally applicable to such permits, the director, bureau of buildings shall issue to the applicant a written certificate stating that the demolition permit application is in order; and a demolition permit will be issued when the applicant is issued a foundation permit for the building which is to be placed on the site, and further stating that the certificate shall remain in force for period of 18 months or until the City of Atlanta enacts legislation designating the site as a Landmark Building or Site, whichever occurs sooner. (6)  The requirements of this section are intended to ensure that no Historic Building and Site be demolished unless the owner(s) has the intent and financial ability to construct a new building replacing the Historic Building or Site proposed to be demolished. (Code 1977, § 16-20.007) 
Sec. 16-20.008. - Same; types and procedures.     There shall be four (4) types of certificates of appropriateness.

If said property is part or parts of properties abutting a street, posting shall be required above, with the notice indicating the relation of the parts proposed for hearing to the parts abutting streets. c.  Notice by regular mail: The director shall also cause notice of the time, date and place of the hearing and the nature of the proposed change to be given by regular mail, with mailing at least 15 days prior to the hearing. Such mail shall be addressed to property owners (as ownership and address appears on the tax records of Fulton/DeKalb County) of all property within 300 feet of the property involved in the proposed change. (3)  Time limits on hearings of the commission: Hearings of the commission on type III applications shall be held within 90 days from the date on which the director receives in due form a complete application from the applicant. The commission shall make a decision on said applications within 21 days of the date of the final public hearing held on said application. (4)  Standards of review: The commission, in reviewing all applications for type III certificates of appropriateness, shall apply the standards specified in section 16-20.009 of the Code of Ordinances. The burden of proof is on the applicant to establish before the commission that the required standards have been met. If the commission finds that said standards are satisfied, after said public hearings, the commission shall issue the appropriate type III certificate of appropriateness, conditionally or otherwise. If the commission finds that the applicant has failed to present sufficient evidence that the standards are satisfied, the type III certificate of appropriateness shall be denied. (5)  Exemption for condition of unreasonable economic return or public health and safety: In any case in which the commission has denied a type III certificate of appropriateness because of the applicant's failure to meet the standards required in subsection (4) above, the applicant may, within 30 days of the date of said denial, apply to the commission for a condition of unreasonable economic return or public safety exemption. Said application(s) for exemption shall follow all the procedures and standards set forth in subsection (d), governing type IV certificates of appropriateness. (6)  Failure to decide in due form within time limits: Failure of the commission to decide said application within the time limits set forth in subsection (c)(3) shall be deemed to be approval of the application for said certificate of appropriateness, and upon request of the applicant, the director, bureau of buildings shall issue any permit dependent upon such application for certificate of appropriateness, if otherwise lawful, and shall record as authorization for such action the provisions of this paragraph. (d)  Type IV: Demolitions: Demolition of a Landmark Building or Site, a building or site in a Landmark District, or a contributing building or site in an Historic District, constitutes an irreplaceable loss to the quality and character of the City of Atlanta. Therefore, all demolitions of said specified buildings or sites shall require a type IV certificate of appropriateness. Said certificates shall be granted according to the following procedures and standards: (1)  Conditions: Type IV certificates of appropriateness shall be issued by the commission only when one (1) or both of the following two (2) conditions have been established pursuant to the standards and criteria required below: a.  The demolition is required to alleviate a threat to public health and safety; and/or b.  The demolition is required to rectify a condition of unreasonable economic return. (2)  Standards and criteria: The standards and criteria required to be shown in order to establish the existence of the conditions specified in subsection (d)(1) above shall be as follows: a.  Threats to public health and safety: To prove the existence of a threat to public health and safety, the applicant must establish, and the commission must find, the following: (i)  Demonstrate through independent analyses and supporting information that a major and imminent threat to public safety exists; (ii)  Present all reasonable alternatives for rectifying the threat and analysis of all such alternatives; and (iii)  Demonstrate that the costs associated with rectifying the threat would create a condition whereby the investments in the project are incapable of earning a reasonable economic return as described in subsection (d)(2)b below. b.  Unreasonable economic return: To prove the existence of a condition of unreasonable economic return, the applicant must establish, and the commission must find, both of the following: (i)  That the building or site is incapable of earning a reasonable economic return.

Failure of the applicant to submit said required documentation and/or evidence shall be construed as a failure on the part of the applicant to meet that standard for which the documentation and/or evidence is lacking.     After receipt of a completed application in which all required information is attached, the commission shall make a determination on said application in accordance with the time frames set forth herein.     For type IV applications based upon a purported condition of a threat to public health and safety, a copy of the application and all supporting documents shall be delivered within five (5) days of receipt of a complete application by the director of the commission to the director, bureau of buildings.     The bureau of buildings shall evaluate each such application in accordance with the standards contained in this section and will prepare a written evaluation and report. Said report shall be presented to the commission at or before the commission's initial public hearing on the application. b.  Notice of public hearing: Notice of the public hearings required for type IV certificates shall be as is provided for in subsection (c)(2) above. c.  Hearings on certificates: The commission shall hold an initial public hearing on every type IV certificate of appropriateness application within 45 days of receipt of the completed application required in subsection (3)a above. At such hearing, the commission shall provide a reasonable opportunity for the presentation of facts, documentation, and the expression of view by the applicant and any other person(s) desiring to be heard. Records of the hearing(s) shall be maintained as is required by subsection (b) above. At said hearing, one of the following procedural courses shall be followed: (i)  For type IV applications based on a condition of a threat to public health and safety, the commission, after hearing from all interested persons, including the bureau of buildings, shall determine whether a certificate shall be granted based upon the standards for said applications set forth in this section.     Said decision shall be made in public within 21 days from the date the commission holds its initial public hearing and shall be made as is required by subsection (b)(9) above. (ii)  For type IV applications based on a condition of unreasonable economic return, the applicant shall have the burden of showing that the property in question is incapable of earning a reasonable economic return in the absence of such a demolition in accordance with the standards and criteria set forth in subsection (d)(2)b above. As a part of the showing, the commission shall cause to be established a three-person economic review panel. Said economic review panel shall be comprised of three (3) real estate and redevelopment experts knowledgeable in real estate economics in general, and more specifically, in the economics of renovation, redevelopment and other aspects of rehabilitation.     The panel shall consist of one (1) person selected by the commission, one (1) person selected by the applicant and one (1) person selected by the first two (2) appointees. If the first two (2) appointees cannot agree on a third person within 30 days of the date of the initial public hearing, the third appointee shall be selected by the commissioner of the department of community development within five (5) days after the expiration of the 30-day period; and the commissioner shall notify the director in writing of his selection.     All of the evidence and documentation presented at the initial public hearing shall be made available to and reviewed by the economic review panel. Further, the commission shall announce at the initial public hearing that further evidence or documentation from any interested party may be made a part of the record by submitting such evidence or documentation to the director by a date certain, and the director shall transmit said materials to the economic review panel. The economic review panel shall convene at its discretion and shall review the evidence of unreasonable economic return in relation to the standards and criteria set forth in subsection (d)(2)b. The economic review panel may, in its discretion, convene a meeting to hear testimony or oral argument by any interested party, provided that notice for such meeting shall be as is provided for in subsection (c)(2) above. Within 45 days after the economic review panel is established, the panel shall complete an evaluation of unreasonable economic return, applying the standards and criteria set forth in subsection (d)(2)b and shall complete and forward a written report on this evaluation to the commission.     At the next regular commission hearing following receipt of the report from the economic review panel, the commission shall reconvene its public hearing to take final action on the application. If, after reviewing all of the evidence, the commission finds that said standards and criteria set forth in subsection (d)(2)b are satisfied, the commission shall issue the appropriate type IV certificate of appropriateness, conditionally or otherwise. If the commission finds that the applicant has failed to present sufficient evidence that the standards and criteria are not satisfied, said certificate shall be denied. Provided, however, that the commission's decision shall be consistent with the conclusions reached in the economic review panel's report unless, based on all of the evidence and documentation presented to the commission, the commission finds by a vote of a three-fourths majority of a quorum present that the economic review panel acted in an arbitrary manner, or that their report was based on an erroneous finding of a material fact. Provided, further, however, that if the report of the economic review panel is that an economic hardship exists, then the commission may defer action on the certificate for a period of 90 days while the commission prepares or causes to be prepared a plan to save the building from demolition pursuant to subsection (4) below. (4)  Preservation plan: After a finding by the commission that the conditions for either a threat to public health and safety or an unreasonable economic return have been met, the commission may, within 60 days, prepare or cause to be prepared a plan under which the subject building or site (1) is preserved in a manner to effectuate the purposes of this chapter, and (2) is capable of providing a reasonable economic return to the property owner(s). The plan may include complete or partial tax abatements, tax credits, authority for alteration or construction not inconsistent with the purposes of this chapter and other actions allowable by law.     This plan will be reviewed by the economic review panel to determine if the plan is capable of providing a reasonable economic return. If the commission does not produce a plan within 60 days, the commission shall issue a certificate of appropriateness for demolition. If the commission develops a plan which is judged by the panel as capable of earning a reasonable economic return, the commission may deny the certificate of appropriateness for demolition.     If a plan is developed, but the plan is deemed by the economic review panel as incapable of earning a reasonable economic return, the commission may, within 30 days of the decision of the panel, recommend to the mayor that the city or a willing private buyer acquire a specified appropriate protective interest, including obtaining title or easements in the building or site involved. If, within an additional 15 days, the city does not initiate eminent domain proceedings to obtain ownership of the appropriate protective interest and neither the city nor a private buyer has made a firm offer to enter into a contract with the owner to acquire such interest, the commission shall issue a certificate of appropriateness for demolition. The commission shall also issue a certificate of appropriateness if an offer is forthcoming but is not equal to or greater than the fair market value of the property immediately prior to designation adjusted for inflation between the time of designation and the time of application for a demolition permit.     The owner may reject any offer for purchase. However, the commission may deny a certificate of appropriateness if the owner rejects an offer which is equal to or greater than the fair market value of the property immediately prior to designation adjusted for inflation between the time of designation and the time of application for a demolition permit. (5)  Salvage plan: In connection with any type IV certificate of appropriateness, the commission may prepare and submit to the applicant, at or before the issuance of any said permit, a salvage plan. Said plan may suggest salvage and preservation, for reuse in restoration elsewhere, specified classes of building materials, architectural details and ornaments, fixtures and the like. Also, in connection with any type IV certificate, the commission may require the preservation of trees, shrubs and other landscaping of substantial significance. (Code 1977, § 16-20.008; Ord. No. 2003-08, §§ 1, 2, 1-28-03) 
Sec. 16-20.009. - Same; further standards.     In deciding individual applications for certificates of appropriateness, the commission shall be guided by the purposes set forth in section 16-20.001, by findings contained in ordinances designating buildings and sites for protection, by purposes and objectives which are contained within individual Landmark and Historic District regulations, and by findings contained in reports prepared in support of Landmark and Historic District regulations as are required in article D of chapter 4 of part 6. Furthermore, in considering whether to grant approval, conditional approval or denial of an application for a type II or type III certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall apply the following standards: (1)  Every reasonable effort shall be made to adapt the property in a manner which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure or site and its environment. (2)  The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building, structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features should be avoided when possible. (3)  Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or site and its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right, and this significance shall be recognized and respected. (4)  Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a building, structure, object or site shall be kept where possible. (5)  Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material should reflect the material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by historical, physical, or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures. (6)  Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural material, and such design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the property, neighborhood or environment. (7)  Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to buildings, structures or sites shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the building, structure or site would be unimpaired. (8)  Considerations on proposed moving of structures, in whole or in part, shall include the effect on the neighborhood from which the move is made. In general, where the structure forms a significant part of a complex of similarly meritorious buildings, preference shall be given to relocation on a site elsewhere in the district. Where the structure does not form part of such a complex, preference shall be given to removal to a location in which the addition will reinforce existing complexes of buildings of significant historic, architectural and/or cultural character. (Code 1977, § 16-20.009) 
Sec. 16-20.010. - Judicial review of decisions on certificates of appropriateness. (a)  Any person aggrieved by a final decision of the commission on a certificate of appropriateness, or any officer, department or board of the city, may appeal from such decision to the Superior Court of Fulton County by filing with the clerk of said court a petition in writing setting forth plainly, fully and distinctly wherein such decision is contrary to law. Such appeal shall be filed within 30 days after the final decision of the commission is rendered. (b)  Upon such filing, the clerk of Superior Court shall give immediate notice thereof to the executive director of the urban design commission. Within the time prescribed by law, the commission shall cause to be filed with said clerk a certified copy of the proceedings held before the commission, including a transcript of the evidence heard before the commission and the decision of the commission. (c)  Thereafter at the next term of the Superior Court or in vacation upon 10 days' notice to the parties, the judge of such court shall proceed to hear and pass upon the appeal. In determining the questions presented by the appeal, the court shall determine whether the decision of the commission is correct as a matter of law. (d)  The filing of an appeal in the Superior Court from a decision of the commission shall not ipso facto act as a supersedeas, but a supersedeas may be granted by the court upon such terms and conditions as may seem reasonable and proper. (Code 1977, § 16-20.010) 
Sec. 16-20.011. - Further provisions. (a)  Inspections: The director shall from time to time inspect, in cooperation with a designee of the director, bureau of buildings, work undertaken pursuant to decisions of the commission. The director shall take all necessary and legal steps to assure conformity to the requirements thereof. In any cases where the director of the commission becomes aware of work being undertaken on any designated property without or in violation of a certificate of appropriateness, the director of the commission shall immediately notify the director, bureau of buildings, who shall issue an immediate stop-work order. Further, the director, bureau of buildings shall furnish the director of the commission a quarterly report concerning all designated properties, number and nature of inspections made, number of correction notices issued, and steps being taken to remedy violations. (b)  Maintenance and Enforcement: The owner or owners, or the owner's agent, of each building or site designated to a category of protection pursuant to this chapter shall keep in good repair all of the exterior portions of such building or site and all interior portions thereof which, if not so maintained, may cause or tend to cause the exterior portion of such building or site to deteriorate, decay, or become damaged or otherwise to fall into a state of disrepair. Further, said owner or owners shall keep in good repair all portions of the building or site which, if not so maintained, may cause or tend to cause such portions to deteriorate, decay, or become damaged or otherwise fall into a state of disrepair. The provisions of this section shall be in addition to all other provisions of law requiring any such building or site to be kept in good repair. The director, bureau of buildings shall be responsible for the enforcement of the maintenance provisions contained within this section. (c)  Interpretation: In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be construed to be the minimum requirements or maximum limitations, as the case may be, commensurate with promotion of the purpose of historic preservation. Whenever the requirements of these regulations are at a variance with the requirements of any other governmentally adopted statute, rule, regulations, ordinance or code, the most restrictive or that imposing the higher standard shall govern. (d)  Penalties: Any person, firm or corporation violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed guilty of an offense and upon conviction thereof shall be punished as provided in section 1-8 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Atlanta, as amended. Each day's continuance of a violation may be considered a separate offense. The owner of any building, structure or site, or part thereof, where anything in violation of this chapter exists, and any architect, builder, contractor or agent of the owner, or any tenant, who commits or assists in the commission of any violation, shall be guilty of a separate offense. (e)  Separability of Provisions: Should any section or provision of this chapter be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of this chapter as a whole or any section thereof other than the section or provision specifically declared to be invalid. (Code 1977, § 16-20.011)

Appeals from any such decision of the director regarding the approval and/or denial of Type II Certificates may be taken by any aggrieved person by filing an appeal in the manner prescribed in the appeals section of chapter 16-20.008(a) for Type I Certificates. (Ord. No. 2003-16, § 1(Att. A), 3-11-03) 
Sec. 16-20A.006. - General regulations.     The following regulations shall apply to more than one subarea in the Cabbagetown Landmark District, which includes all five subareas. certificates of appropriateness required above shall be obtained from the commission or the director, as applicable, in accordance with the following regulations: (1)  Minimum standards. These regulations constitute the minimum standards that shall be followed and shall be applied by the commission and director. (2)  The commission shall apply the standards in section 16-20.009 only if the standards set forth elsewhere in this chapter 20A do not specifically address the application. (3)  Applications. Materials necessary for complete review of an application shall be submitted with the application as set forth by the director. In addition, a scaled site plan showing all improvements, photographs of existing conditions and adjoining properties, and elevation drawings of all improvements shall be submitted for all Type III certificate of appropriateness applications. For new construction of a principal building, the application shall also include a scaled drawing showing all front yard setbacks, heights of, and widths of, and the distances between all existing buildings on the block face, along with those of the proposed structure. (4)  Additional notification. The applicant shall be given contact information for interested Cabbagetown community organizations and shall be directed to provide the organization with a copy of the submitted application and attachments within three days of submission to the commission. (5)  Cabbagetown design guidelines. The commission shall adopt and maintain guidelines, referred to herein as the Cabbagetown Design Guidelines. These guidelines shall: further the intent of these regulations; further define elements of architectural style and applicability; provide important additional detailed information regarding the construction and renovation of historic buildings; and be used as a guide to ensure the compatibility of future development in the Cabbagetown Landmark District. (6)  The compatibility rule. a)  In general, the intent of the regulations and guidelines is to ensure that alterations to existing structures and new construction are compatible with the design, proportions, scale, massing, and general character of the contributing buildings in the immediately adjacent environment of the block face, the entire block, a particular subarea (including appropriate reference to subarea style) or the district as a whole. To permit flexibility, many regulations are made subject to the compatibility rule, which states: "The element in question (roof form, architectural trim, etc.) shall match that which predominates on the contributing buildings of the same architectural style and like use on that block face or, where quantifiable (i.e., buildings height and width as measured at front façade, floor height, lot dimensions, etc.), no smaller than the smallest or larger than the largest such dimension of the contributing buildings of the same architectural style and like use in that block face." b)  For the purposes of the compatibility rule, height and width shall be measured at the front façade. c)  In any instance where one contributing building of the same architectural style and like use on a block face is higher or wider by more than ten percent than any other contributing building of like use on a block face, such structure shall be eliminated in the application of the compatibility rule. d)  Those elements to which the rule applies are noted in the regulations by a reference to the "compatibility rule." (7)  Variances. Variance requests shall be heard by the commission which will have the authority to grant or deny variances from the provisions of this chapter when, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of its provisions in a particular case will result in unnecessary hardship. The procedures, standards, criteria and appeal provisions for decisions regarding such variances shall be the same as those specified in chapter 26 of this Part 16. (8)  Financial hardship exemptions. a)  These regulations set forth a minimum standard of architectural compatibility with the rest of the district. However, in order to balance other equally important objectives of economic development, neighborhood revitalization, and prevention of displacement of residents, the commission may allow reasonable exemptions from these regulations to a property owner's principle residence on the ground of economic hardship to the property owner. b)  The burden of proving economic hardship by a preponderance of the evidence shall be on the applicant. c)  The commission shall consider the following factors in determining whether an economic hardship exemption in whole or in part will be granted: 1.  The present income of the property owner(s) and those occupying the property; 2.  The age of the property owner; 3.  The length of time the property owner has resided in the neighborhood or in the residence for which the exemption is sought; 4.  The availability of other sources of funds that are appropriate to the circumstances of the applicant, including loans, grants and tax abatements; 5.  The costs associated with adherence to these regulations; 6.  The degree of existing architectural significance and integrity of the structure; and 7.  The purpose and intent of this chapter. d)  The commission shall consider these factors and shall grant an exemption, in whole or in part, as appropriate upon a finding that the applicant's economic hardship outweighs the need for strict adherence to these regulations. (9)  Minimum lot requirements.

Sec. 16-20B.001. - Statement of intent.     The intent of establishing the regulations for the Druid Hills Landmark District is as follows: (1)  To recognize the masterpiece of design that is the 1893 plan for Druid Hills created for Joel Hurt's "ideal residential suburb" by Frederick Law Olmsted, the father of American landscape architecture, a plan subsequently formalized by his sons, the Olmsted Brothers, and completed by the Druid Hills Corporation. (2)  To preserve the environmental character and physical appearance of the area, including parkways, houses and buildings created during the 1895 to 1941 period of development; existing general landscaping features; and existing spatial relationships between the buildings and streets and to ensure that any new development is compatible with the present architectural and spatial attributes that prevail. (3)  To preserve the residential character of the area except when nonresidential uses may be required to preserve houses and buildings built during the historically significant period of development and to ensure that redevelopment reflects and reinforces the exceptional features established in the original planning. (4)  To ensure that new construction observes the general setback and height restrictions of the original development and is in harmony with the historic character of the district. (5)  To ascribe special recognition to the manner in which the several churches contribute so substantially to the beauty of the district. ( Ord. No. 2015-58(15-O-1417), § 1(Att. A), 11-25-15 )

Sec. 16-20B.003. - General regulations.     The following general regulations shall apply to the entire district which includes the following subareas: (1) the Ponce de Leon Corridor; (2) Fairview Road; (3) Springdale Road/Oakdale Road/Lullwater Road/Lullwater Parkway and (4) Emory University. Any proposed development, new construction, addition, alteration, or demolition shall require a certificate of appropriateness as noted below and shall conform to the following regulations: (1)  General standards. In the Druid Hills Landmark District, the Commission shall apply the following general standards only if the standards set forth elsewhere in this chapter 20B do not specifically address the application: (a)  A property shall be used as it was historically or be given a new use that requires minimal change to its distinctive materials, features, spaces, and spatial relationships. (b)  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize a property shall be avoided. (c)  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes shall not be undertaken that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or elements from other historic properties. (d)  Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. (e)  Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques, or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property, shall be preserved. (f)  Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, texture, and, where possible, materials. (g)  Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. (h)  Archaeological resources shall be protected and preserved in place. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken. (i)  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction, shall not destroy historic materials, features, and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new work may be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, scale and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its environment. (j)  New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. (2)  Certificates of appropriateness. (a)  Except as otherwise provided herein, the procedures for determining the correct type of certificate of appropriateness shall be those specified in section 16-20.008 of the Zoning Ordinance. (b)  Notwithstanding any other provision herein, no certificate of appropriateness shall be required unless, at a minimum, the work would otherwise require a building permit. (c)  No certificate of appropriateness shall be required for the removal of dead, dying, or hazardous tree as defined in the City of Atlanta Tree Ordinance or a tree with a diameter breast height of less than six inches. (d)  Type I certificates of appropriateness shall be reviewed and decided by the Director of the Commission and are required for the following: (i)  In-kind repair or replacement of roofing material, and in-kind repair of driveways, walkways, other similar paving, windows, and exterior doors. (e)  The following Type II certificates of appropriateness shall be reviewed and decided by the director of the commission and shall be required for new paving not visible from the public right-of-way, fences, walls, and retaining walls. If a Type II certificate of appropriateness is required and the proposed alteration meets the requirements of this chapter, as applicable, and other criteria applicable to Type II certificates, the director of the commission shall issue the Type II certificate within 14 days of receipt of the completed application. If a Type II certificate of appropriateness is required and the proposed alteration does not meet the requirements of this chapter, as applicable, the director of the commission shall deny the application with notice to the applicant within 14 days of receipt of the completed application. Appeals from any such decision of the director regarding the approval and/or denial of Type II certificates may be taken by any aggrieved person by filing an appeal in the manner prescribed in the appeals section of chapter 16-20.008(a) for Type I certificates. (f)  The following Type II certificates of appropriateness shall be reviewed and decided by the commission and shall be required for the following: (i)  Any alteration to any façade of any principal structure or accessory structure and all site work, except as noted in section 16-20B.003(2)(b), (c), (d), and (e) above. (ii)  Clearance or removal of any tree with a diameter breast height of six inches or greater, except as noted in subsection (2)(c) above, and shrub massings or hedges over three feet high. (iii)  Any major alteration in the landscape or topography which is visible from the public right-of-way. (g)  Type III certificates of appropriateness shall be reviewed and decided by the commission and shall be required for: (i)  All new principal structures. (ii)  All additions to existing principal structures and accessory buildings, including decks. (iii)  All new accessory structures. (iv)  Subdivision, aggregation, consolidation or replatting of lots. (v)  The conversion of any existing building to a nonresidential permitted principal use or use permitted by special use permit. (h)  Type IV certificates of appropriateness shall be reviewed and decided by the commission and shall be required for the demolition or moving of any contributing principal structure or contributing accessory building.

All retaining walls shall be faced with brick, stone or stucco. (8)  Subdivisions, aggregations, consolidations and replats. The platting pattern of the Druid Hills Landmark District is an integral, defining, and essential part of the historic character of the District. In addition to the requirements of the subdivision and zoning ordinances, including but not limited to sections 15-08.002(a)(2) and 15-08.005(d)(6), no subdivision, aggregation, consolidation or replat shall be approved unless the commission finds: a.  The proposed subdivision, aggregation, consolidation or replat conforms to the platting pattern in the Druid Hills Landmark District with regard to lot size, dimensions, orientation, and configurations as it existed in 1982, as documented in maps attached to the 1982 designation of the Druid Hills Landmark District, and maps attached to the 2001 Druid Hills Landmark District expansion; and b.  The resulting lot(s) are so laid out that any existing structures meet the District regulations and that any new structures can be situated and constructed upon such lots to meet the District regulations. (9)  Contributing/non-contributing property list. a.  All contributing buildings, structures or sites within the District shall be shown on the List adopted herewith entitled "Druid Hills Landmark District—Street Address Range and C/NC Property Determination List" (List).

No. 2014-21(14-O-1118), § 1(Attach. A), 6-11-14 ) 
Sec. 16-20C.004. - General regulations.     The following general regulations shall apply to all properties within the Martin Luther King, Jr. Landmark District, except where otherwise stated. 1.  General criteria. The commission shall apply the standards set forth below only when the standards set forth elsewhere in Chapter 20C do not specifically address the application in whole or in part: a.  A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use authorized in section 16-20C.005 using minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment. b.  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided. c.  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken. d.  Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. e.  Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved. f.  Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence. g.  Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. h.  Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken. i.  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment. j.  New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 2.  The compatibility rule. a.  Block definitions. The following words and terms, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section: i.  Block. An area of land located within a continuous perimeter of public streets. An individual block shall begin at the back edge of curb of the adjacent street. Interstate 75/85, when no intervening street exists, shall be permitted to count as an adjacent street for purposes of meeting this definition, beginning at the edge of the adjacent 75/85 right-of-way. ii.  Block face. One side of a block, located between two consecutive street intersections. b.  The intent of these regulations is to ensure that alterations to existing structures and new construction are compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features of each subarea and of the immediately adjacent environment of a particular block or block face. To further that intent and simultaneously retain flexibility, the regulations provide a "compatibility rule" which is: The element in question, such as roof form or architectural trim, shall match that which predominates: i.  On contributing buildings of like use along the same block face in Subareas 1 and 2. ii.  On contributing buildings on the same block in Subareas 3 and 4. c.  Where quantifiable, such as building height or floor height, the element shall be no smaller than the smallest or larger than the largest such dimension of the contributing building(s) along the same block face in Subareas 1 and 2 and on individual blocks in Subareas 3 and 4. d.  Those elements to which the compatibility rule applies are specified in these regulations by reference to "compatibility rule." e.  Building height shall be measured on the front elevation from the average point of grade on the front elevation to the highest point of the roof or façade, whichever is higher. f.  For new construction of single-family or two-family dwellings, the final average finished grade of the lot shall be no higher than the highest grade level existing prior to such construction or related land disturbance at any point along the front yard property line adjacent to the public right-of-way. The intent and purpose of this grade provision is to prevent manipulation of grade levels in order to construct a taller dwelling than would otherwise be authorized. g.  Whenever individual block faces in Subareas 1 and 2 or individual blocks in Subareas 3 and 4 are void of contributing structures, the contributing structures located on the opposing block face shall be utilized for purposes of adhering to compatibility rule provisions. If the opposing block face is void of contributing structures, the contributing structures on the nearest block face along the same street frontage shall be utilized. h.  Urban gardens. i.  Market gardens are limited to parcels which are used as churches, synagogues, temples, mosques and other religious worship facilities or schools. 3.  Certificates of appropriateness. a.  General provisions. i.  The procedures for determining the correct type of certificate of appropriateness shall be those specified in section 16-20.008, except as otherwise provided herein. ii.  No certificate of appropriateness shall be required unless, at a minimum, the work would otherwise require a building permit. iii.  No certificate of appropriateness shall be required to repaint any structure or portion thereof, or, to make ordinary repairs and maintenance using in-kind materials. iv.  No certificates of appropriateness shall be required for demolition or moving of non-contributing structures. b.  Type II certificates of appropriateness. i.  Type II certificates reviewed by the director. The following shall require a Type II certificate of appropriateness, and shall be reviewed by the director of the commission: (1)  Fences, walls and retaining walls; (2)  Decks, skylights, solar panels, mechanical equipment and where authorized, antennas and related equipment; (3)  New accessory structures and alterations to existing accessory structures; (4)  Shutters and awnings; (5)  Security doors and window grates; (6)  Replacement of elements that otherwise meet the regulations including but not limited to siding, windows, porch railings, porch columns, porch flooring, and exterior doors; and (7)  Paving intended for pedestrians including sidewalks, walkways, paths and porches. If such Type II certificates of appropriateness meet the requirements of this chapter and other criteria applicable to Type II certificates the director shall issue the Type II certificate within 14 days of receipt of the completed application. If such Type II certificates of appropriateness do not meet the requirements of this chapter and such other criteria, the director shall deny the application, with notice to the applicant, within 14 days of receipt of the completed application. Appeals from the decision of the director either approving or denying such Type II certificates may be taken by any aggrieved person by filing an appeal in the manner prescribed in the appeals section of chapter 16-20.008(a) for Type I certificates. ii.  Type II certificates reviewed by the commission. All required Type II certificates of appropriateness not listed above shall be reviewed by the commission. In addition, the following shall be reviewed by the commission as a Type II certificate of appropriateness: (1)  Alterations to any façade of any principal structure; and (2)  All site work, except as noted in section 16-20C.004(3)(b)(i)(7). c.  Type III certificates of appropriateness. The following Type III certificates of appropriateness shall be reviewed by the commission and shall be required for: i.  All new principal structures; ii.  Additions; iii.  Height or building footprint revisions to previously approved plans that are yet to be constructed; iv.  Lot consolidations, subdivisions and replatting; and v.  Variances, special exceptions and administrative appeals. d.  Type IV certificates of appropriateness. i.  Type IV certificates of appropriateness shall be reviewed by the commission and shall be required for the demolition or moving of any contributing structure. ii.  A partial demolition of a contributing structure shall require a Type IV certificate of appropriateness only when said partial demolition will result in the loss of significant architectural features that destroys the structure's historic or cultural interpretability or importance. 4.  Contributing buildings list. a.  All contributing buildings, structures or sites within the district shall be shown on the list adopted herewith entitled "Martin Luther King, Jr. Landmark district contributing buildings list." Said contributing buildings list shall identify each building, structure or site within Subareas 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the district that meets the definition of "contributing building, structure or site" set forth in section 16-20.002. b.  The director shall periodically review said contributing buildings list to correct errors or omissions to said list, or to reflect any changed conditions relevant to the contributing status of buildings, structures or sites within the district, consistent with the requirements of Chapter 20C and Chapter 20 of Part 16, and shall maintain public records of said list and all such errors, omissions or updates. An action by the director to correct such errors or omissions, or to make updates, shall be initiated by execution of a signed and dated form promulgated by the director specifying the action initiated, the reason(s) for such action, and the identification of all property subject to said action. Said form shall be mailed by first class mail to the owner or owners of the effected property within five calendar days of the initiation of the action by the director. c.  An action by the director to correct errors or omissions, or to update, the contributing buildings list as authorized in subsection 16-20C.004(4)(b) above shall result in the immediate prohibition of any new or amended applications of any kind effecting such property, including but not limited to demolition requests, building permits or land disturbance permits, and including acceptance of any such application or request by any City of Atlanta bureau, agency, official, employee or agent. Said prohibitions shall become automatically effective without further action of any kind immediately upon the date and time that the director takes an action authorized in subsection 16-20C.004(4)(b) above. The purpose and intent of this provision is to maintain the status quo regarding any such effected property until the director's action is reviewed and affirmed or reversed by the commission in the manner specified in subsection 16-20C.004(4)(d) below. The period of this mandatory interim protection shall be 90 days or until a final decision reviewing such action is made by the commission, whichever first occurs, commencing on the date and time of the director's decision. This interim control period allows and is based upon approximately 30 days for the initial scheduling of the public hearing following the director's action and approximately 60 days for completion of the public hearing and a final decision by the commission. d.  All actions by the director to correct errors or omissions, or to update, said list shall be reviewed and approved by the commission using the notice and procedures required for Type III certificates of appropriateness with the following modifications: i.  Hearings on such review and approval by the commission shall be scheduled by the director within 30 days of the director's action on such correction(s) or update(s) and shall be decided by the commission within a reasonable time; and ii.  The commission shall affirm the action(s) of the director upon an expressed finding by the commission that the director's action(s) correctly applied the definitions and requirements for determining the contributing status of the properties in question in Chapter 20C and Chapter 20 of Part 16. In exercising its review, the commission may reverse or affirm the action(s) of the director, wholly or partly. Appeals from a final decision by the commission on such reviews shall be taken by any person aggrieved by such decision pursuant to Code section 16-20.010. 5.  Transitional Zone: Subarea 5. a.  The existing zoning map and regulations governing all properties within the Transitional Zone (Subarea 5) of the district shall remain in full force and effect. The regulations set forth herein and in Code section 16-28A.010 (Signs) that pertain to the Transitional Zone (Subarea 5) shall be overlaid upon, and shall be imposed in addition to, said existing zoning regulations. b.  Applications for rezonings, special use permits and special exceptions within the Transitional Zone (Subarea 5) shall be reviewed and commented upon by the commission. Applications for building permits, special administrative permits, variances, subdivisions, replats or lot consolidations within the Transitional Zone (Subarea 5) shall be reviewed and commented upon by the director. c.  These regulations are intended to control through a review and comment procedure the potential for adverse impact resulting from development and redevelopment in the periphery of Subareas 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the district. 6.  Financial hardship exemptions. a.  These regulations set forth a minimum standard of architectural compatibility with the rest of the district. However, in order to balance with other equally important objectives in the district, including economic development, neighborhood revitalization, and prevention of displacement of residents, the commission may allow reasonable exemptions from these regulations on the ground of economic hardship to the property owner. b.  In order to qualify for an economic hardship exemption, the applicant(s) must first make a showing that the alteration(s) requested is necessary in order to continue utilizing the structure for its intended purposes. c.  If the commission finds that the requirement of subsection (6)(b) herein is satisfied, they may grant an exemption, in whole or in part, only in accordance with each of the following factors, standards and criteria: i.  The burden of proof that the regulations and guidelines pose such a hardship shall be on the property owner. ii.  The commission shall consider the following factors in determining whether an economic hardship exemption in whole or in part will be granted: (1)  The present and future income of the property owner(s) and those occupying the property; (2)  The availability, at present or in the future, or other sources of income of revenue, including loans, grants, and tax abatements; (3)  The costs associated with adherence to the district regulations in comparison to the costs associated with achieving the same proposal without the district regulations; (4)  The degree of existing architectural importance and integrity of the structure; and (5)  The purpose and intent of this chapter. iii.  The commission shall balance these factors as applied to the applicant for said exemption and shall grant said exemption, in whole or in part, as appropriate to the case upon a finding that the economic hardship to the applicant is significant and substantially outweighs the need for strict adherence to these regulations. Appeals from a final decision by the commission on such reviews shall be taken by any person aggrieved by such decision pursuant to Code section 16-20.010. 7.  Lot consolidations, subdivisions and replatting. No subdivision, consolidation or replatting of parcels or lots shall be approved unless the applicant establishes: a.  That the proposed subdivision, consolidation or replat is substantially consistent with the historic character of the district and meets all lot requirements set forth in Chapter 20C; and b.  That the proposed subdivision, consolidation or replat will facilitate development that furthers the historic qualities and regulations of the district. In addition, within Subareas 1 and 2, all subdivisions, consolidations or replats of parcels or lots shall conform to the historic platting pattern in these subareas with regard to lot size, dimensions, and configurations. 8.  Variances, special exceptions and administrative appeals. a.  Variance applications and applications for special exceptions and administrative appeals from these regulations shall be heard by the commission. The commission shall have the authority to grant or deny variances from the provisions of this chapter pursuant to the procedures, standards, and criteria specified in section 16-26.001 through section 16-26.006. The commission shall have the authority to grant or deny applications for special exceptions from the provisions of this chapter pursuant to the procedures, standards and criteria specified in section 16-25.001 through section 16.25.005. The commission shall have the authority to grant or deny applications for administrative appeal pursuant to the standards in section 16-30.010 (a) through (d). b.  Appeals from final decisions of the commission regarding variances, special exceptions and administrative appeals shall be as provided for in section 16-20.010. 9.  Prohibited variances. Notwithstanding any provision in this chapter or part to the contrary, no variance from this chapter's maximum building height requirements shall be permitted or authorized by the commission, commission staff or any other board, official or entity. 10.  Time period of historical significance. Where referenced in this chapter, the time period of historical significance for the district shall be the lifetime of Martin Luther King, Jr. (1929—1968). 11.  Special permits: The following uses shall require a special permit of the type indicated to be granted by the director of the commission with the applicable provisions of Chapter 25 of this part. a)  Special administrative permits: 1)  Urban gardens as a principal use on an undeveloped lot. ( Ord.

Sec. 16-20G.005. - General regulations.     The following general regulations shall apply to the West End Historic District. (1)  Certificates of Appropriateness: Certificates of appropriateness within this district shall be required as follows: (a)  When required: (i)  To change the exterior appearance of any portion of a structure within the district, when said change can be seen from the public right-of-way; (ii)  To erect a new structure or to make an addition to any structure within the district, when said addition can be seen from public right-of-way; and (iii)  To demolish or move any contributing structure, in whole or in part, within the district. (b)  Type required: (i)  Except as otherwise provided herein, the procedures for determining the appropriate type of certificate of appropriateness shall be those specified in section 16-20.008 of the Code of Ordinances. (ii)  Notwithstanding any other provision herein, no certificate of appropriateness shall be required unless, at a minimum, the work would otherwise require a building permit. (iii)  Type I certificates of appropriateness for ordinary repairs and maintenance are not required in this district. This exemption in no way obviates the requirements for certificates of appropriateness set forth in this section. (iv)  The following Type II Certificates of Appropriateness shall be reviewed by the director of the commission and shall be required for any of the following: (a)  fences, walls, retaining walls; (b)  decks, skylights, solar panels, mechanical and communication equipment if visible from a public street; (c)  new accessory structures and alterations to existing accessory structures; (d)  shutters, awnings if visible from a public street; (e)  replacement of non-original, non-historic or missing elements that otherwise meet the regulations, including but not limited to siding, windows, porch railings, porch columns, porch flooring, exterior doors if visible from a public street, and (f)  paving. If a Type II Certificate of Appropriateness is required and the proposed alteration meets the requirements of this chapter, as applicable, and other criteria applicable to Type II certificates, the director of the commission shall issue the Type II Certificate within 14 days of receipt of the completed application. If a Type II Certificate of Appropriateness is required and the proposed alteration does not meet the requirements of this chapter, as applicable, the director of the commission shall deny the application with notice to the applicant within 14 days of receipt of the completed application. Appeals from any such decision of the director regarding the approval and/or denial of Type II Certificates may be taken by any aggrieved person by filing an appeal in the manner prescribed in the appeals section of chapter 16-20.008(a) for Type I Certificates. (v)  The following Type II Certificates of Appropriateness shall be review by the commission and shall be required for any of the following to the extent they are visible from a public street: a.  Alterations to any façade of any principal structure; and b.  All site work, except as noted in Section 16-20G.005(b)(4). (vi)  The following Type III Certificates of Appropriateness shall be reviewed by the commission and shall be required for: a.  All new principal structures. b.  Additions that are visible from a public street or park. c.  Revisions to previously approved plans that result in an increase in floor area ratio, lot coverage, height or a change in the building footprint. c.  Subdivisions and aggregations. d.  Variances. (vii)  Type IV certificates of appropriateness shall be reviewed by the commission and shall be required for the demolition or moving of any contributing principal structure. A partial demolition of a contributing principal structure shall require a Type IV certificate of appropriateness only when said partial demolition will result in the loss of significant architectural features that destroys the structure's historic interpretability or importance. (2)  The Compatibility Rule: The compatibility rule is a method of ensuring that alterations to existing structures and the design of proposed new construction are sensitive to and sympathetic toward existing elements of design, proportions, scale, massing, materials, and general character of the contributing buildings in the immediately adjacent environment of the block face. To permit flexibility, many regulations are made subject to the compatibility rule, which states: "The elements in question (roof form, architectural trim, etc.) shall match that which predominates on the contributing buildings of the same block face, or where quantifiable (i.e., buildings height and width as measured at front façade, floor height, lot dimensions, etc.), shall be no smaller than the smallest or larger than the largest such dimension of the contributing buildings of the same block face." Those elements to which the compatibility rule applies are specified in these regulations by reference to "compatibility rule." (3)  Variances: The urban design commission shall have the power to hear, grant and deny variances from the provisions of this chapter (20G) when, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of its provisions in a particular case will result in unnecessary hardship. The procedures, standards, criteria, and appeal provisions for decisions regarding such variances shall be the same as those specified in chapter 26 of this part 46, which provisions are hereby incorporated herein. (4)  Financial Hardship Exemptions: (a)  These regulations set forth a minimum standard of architectural compatibility with the rest of the district. However, in order to balance with other equally important objectives in the district, including economic development, neighborhood revitalization, and prevention of displacement of residents, the urban design commission may allow reasonable exemptions from these regulations on the ground of economic hardship to the property owner. (b)  In order to qualify for an economic hardship exemption, the applicant(s) must first make a showing that the alteration(s) requested is necessary in order to continue utilizing the structure for its intended purposes. (c)  If the urban design commission finds that the requirement of subsection (ii) herein is satisfied, they may grant an exemption, in whole or in part, only in accordance with the following factors, standards and criteria: (i)  The burden of proof that the regulations and guidelines pose such a hardship shall be on the property owner. (ii)  The urban design commission shall consider the following factors in determining whether an economic hardship exemption in whole or in part will be granted: a.  The present and future income of the property owner(s) and those occupying the property; b.  The availability, at present or in the future, or other sources of income of revenue, including loans, grants, and tax abatements; c.  The costs associated with adherence to the district regulations; d.  The degree of existing architectural importance and integrity of the structure; and e.  The purpose and intent of this chapter. (iii)  The urban design commission shall balance these factors as applied to the applicant for said exemption and shall grant said exemption, in whole or in part, as appropriate to the case upon a finding that the economic hardship to the applicant is significant and substantially outweighs the need for strict adherence to these regulations. (5)  Lot size: In addition to the requirements of the subdivision and zoning ordinances, the compatibility rule specified in this chapter 20G shall apply to all subdivisions and aggregations of lots with regard to lot size, dimensions and configurations. (Code 1977, § 16-20G.005; Ord.

The district is divided into three (3) subareas, as shown on said official zoning map, which shall be known as: (1)  The Residential Subarea; (2)  The Transitional Commercial Subarea; and (3)  The Transitional Industrial Subarea. (Code 1977, § 16-20I.003) 
Sec. 16-20I.004. - Organization.     The overlay zoning regulations for the Adair Park Historic District are composed of two (2) parts. The first part consists of general regulations which apply to all property located within this district. The second part consists of specific regulations that apply to each of the subareas. (Code 1977, § 16-20I.004) 
Sec. 16-20I.005. - General regulations.     The following regulations shall apply to all properties within the Adair Park Historic District. (1)  The Compatibility Rule: The compatibility rule is a method of requiring that alterations and new construction are sensitive and sympathetic to existing elements of design, scale and general character of the district with particular attention to the immediate environment constituting a particular block. In accordance with this purpose, the compatibility rule is as follows: "To the maximum extent possible, the element in question, such as roof form or architectural trim, shall substantially match that which predominates on that block. When elements are quantifiable, such as building height or floor heights, they shall equal the statistical average of all like elements of all structures of like use in that block." Those elements to which the compatibility rule applies are specified in regulations by reference to "compatibility rule." (2)  Variances: The urban design commission shall have the power to hear, grant and deny variances from the provisions of this chapter when, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of its provisions in a particular case will result in unnecessary hardship. The procedures, standards, criteria, and appeal provisions for decisions regarding such variances shall be the same as those specified in chapter 26 of this Part 16, which provisions are hereby incorporated herein. (3)  Signs: General advertising signs shall not be permitted in the historic district. (Code 1977, § 16-20I.005)

This exemption in no way obviates the requirements for certificates of appropriateness for all minor alterations (Type II), major alterations (Type III) and demolitions (Type IV, except partial demolitions). 2.  Except with regard to Type I certificates, the procedures for determining the appropriate type of certificate required under subsection 16-20I.006(1)a. above shall be those specified in section 16-20.008 of the zoning code, provided, however, that a partial demolition shall require a Type IV certificate of appropriateness only when said partial demolition will result in the loss of significant architectural features which destroys the structure's historic interpretability or importance. (2)  Financial Hardship Exemptions: a.  These regulations set forth a minimum standard of architectural compatibility within the subarea. However, in order to balance this concern with other equally important objectives in the district, including economic development, neighborhood revitalization, and prevention of displacement of residents, the urban design commission may allow reasonable exemptions from these regulations on the ground of economic hardship to the property owner. The burden of proof that the regulations and guidelines pose such a hardship shall be on the property owner. b.  In order to qualify for an economic hardship exemption, the applicant(s) must first make a showing that the alteration(s) requested is necessary in order to continue utilizing the structure for its intended purpose. c.  If the urban design commission finds that this requirement of subsection 16-20I.006(2)b. herein is satisfied, they shall consider the following factors in determining whether an economic hardship exemption in whole or in part will be granted: 1.  The present and future income of the property owner(s) and those occupying the property; 2.  The availability, at present or in the future of other sources of income of revenue, including loans, grants, and tax abatements; 3.  The cost associated with adherence to the subarea regulations; 4.  The degree of existing architectural importance and integrity of the structure; and 5.  The purpose and intent of this chapter. d.  The urban design commission shall balance these factors as applied to the applicant for said exemption and shall grant said exemption, in whole or in part, as appropriate to the case upon a finding that the economic hardship to the applicant is significant and substantially outweighs the need for strict adherence to these regulations. (3)  Lot Size: In addition to the requirements of the subdivision and zoning ordinances, the compatibility rule specified in this chapter 20I shall apply to all subdivisions and aggregations of lots with regard to lot size, dimensions and configurations. (4)  Architectural Standards: a.  Building façades: 1.  All new construction shall conform to the existing building orientation (setbacks) by having sidewalks, front yards, porches and front doors facing and parallel to the street, and if located on a corner, the main façade shall face the principal street whenever possible. 2.  At a minimum, the front of all new construction, including any portion thereof, shall be placed at the distances from the street determined by the compatibility rule.

CHAPTER 20J. - WHITTIER MILL HISTORIC DISTRICT[24] Footnotes: --- (24) --- Cross reference— Historic preservation program, § 6-4041 et seq. 
Sec. 16-20J.001. - Statement of intent.     The intent of the regulations for the Whittier Mill Historic District is as follows: (1)  To enhance and integrate land use regulations, tailored to the historic character of this district, with existing land use regulations; (2)  To continue and encourage residential uses in the district; (3)  To preserve and protect the historic attributes of the built environment of the district, particularly, those houses, buildings and structures constructed prior to 1930; the existing street patterns; and limited access/egress which contributes to the village; (4)  To preserve existing landscape and topographical features of the district that exhibit or will assist in maintaining significant historic elements of the village; (5)  To maintain the spatial relationships that now exist between buildings, and between buildings and streets; (6)  To ensure that additions and modifications to existing structures reinforce the historic qualities and features of the district; (7)  To ensure that new development is consistent with the historic character of the district; (8)  To balance the need to regulate exterior changes to the structures in the district with the unique layout, landscaping and topography of the district that results in a high percentage of visibility from the public right-of-ways so as to exercise greater regulatory control over principal façades than other façades; (9)  To encourage economic development, neighborhood revitalization and prevention of displacement of residents; and (10)  To preserve and enhance the important aesthetic appearance of the district so as to substantially promote the public health, safety and welfare. (Code 1977, § 16-20J.001) 
Sec. 16-20J.002. - Scope of regulations. (a)  The existing zoning map and regulations governing all properties within the Whittier Mill Historic District shall remain in full force and effect. The following zoning regulations shall be overlaid upon, and shall be imposed in addition to, said existing zoning regulations. Whenever the following overlay regulations are at variance with said existing zoning regulations, the following regulations (chapter 20J) shall apply. All other statutes, rules, regulations, ordinances, or other governmentally adopted regulations pertaining to properties within this district shall continue to apply; and any variance between said other regulations and these overlay district regulations (chapter 20J) shall be governed by the interpretation provision set forth in section 16-20.011(c) of the Code of Ordinances. (b)  Except when otherwise explicitly provided, the provisions of chapter 20 of this part shall apply to this district. (Code 1977, § 16-20J.002) 
Sec. 16-20J.003. - Boundaries.     The boundaries of the Whittier Mill Historic District shall be as shown on the official zoning map adopted herewith entitled the "Whittier Mill Historic District." The district is divided into two (2) subareas, as shown on said official zoning map, which shall be known as: (1)  The Residential Subarea; and (2)  The Transitional Subarea. (Code 1977, § 16-20J.003) 
Sec. 16-20J.004. - Organization.     The overlay zoning regulations for the Whittier Mill Historic District are composed of two (2) parts. The first part consists of general regulations which apply to all property located within this district. The second part consists of specific regulations that apply to each of the subareas. (Code 1977, § 16-20J.004) 
Sec. 16-20J.005. - General regulations.     The following regulations shall apply to all properties within the Whittier Mill Historic District: (1)  The Compatibility Rule: The compatibility rule is a method of requiring that alterations and new construction are sensitive and sympathetic to existing elements of design, scale and general character of the district with particular attention to the immediate environment constituting a particular block. In accordance with this purpose, the compatibility rule is as follows: "To the maximum extent possible, the element in question, such as roof form or architectural trim, shall substantially match that which predominates on that block. When elements are quantifiable, such as building height or floor heights, they shall equal the statistical average of all like elements of all structures of like use in that block." Those elements to which the compatibility rule applies are specified in regulations by reference to "compatibility rule." (2)  Variances: The urban design commission shall have the power to hear, grant and deny variances from the provisions of this chapter when, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of its provisions in a particular case will result in unnecessary hardship. The procedures, standards, criteria, and appeal provisions for decisions regarding such variances shall be the same as those specified in chapter 26 of this Part 16, which provisions are hereby incorporated herein. (Code 1977, § 16-20J.005) 
Sec. 16-20J.006. - Specific regulations—Residential Subarea I.     In addition to the general regulations set forth in section 16-20J.005, and any other applicable regulations, the following regulations shall apply to all properties located within Residential Subarea I: (1)  Certificates of Appropriateness: Certificates of appropriateness within this subarea shall be required as follows: a.  When required: 1.  To change the exterior appearance of the following elements of a structure within the subarea, when said changes can be seen from the public right-of-way: foundations, siding, chimneys and roofs; 2.  To change the exterior appearance of the following elements of the front façade of a structure: windows, doors, architectural details and porches. For the purpose of this chapter, front façade means the elevation of the building which faces the front yard as defined in Code of Ordinances section 16-28.007(3) and (4). 3.  To erect a new structure; and 4.  To demolish or move any contributing structure, in whole or in part, within the subarea. b.  Type required: 1.  Type I certificates of appropriateness for ordinary repairs and maintenance are not required in this subarea. This exemption in no way obviates the requirements for certificates of appropriateness for all minor alterations (Type II), major alterations (Type III) and demolitions (Type IV, except partial demolitions). 2.  Except with regard to Type I certificates, the procedures for determining the appropriate type of certificate required under subsection 16-20J.006(1)a. above shall be those specified in section 16-20.008 of the zoning code, provided, however, that a partial demolition shall require a Type IV certificate of appropriateness only when said partial demolition will result in the loss of significant architectural features which destroys the structure's historic interpretability or importance of the front façade. (2)  Financial Hardship Exemptions: a.  These regulations set forth a minimum standard of architectural compatibility within the subarea. However, in order to balance this concern with other equally important objectives in the district, including economic development, neighborhood revitalization, and prevention of displacement of residents, the urban design commission may allow reasonable exemptions from these regulations on the ground of economic hardship to the property owner. The burden of proof that the regulations and guidelines pose such a hardship shall be on the property owner. b.  In order to qualify for an economic hardship exemption, the applicant(s) must first make a showing that the alteration(s) requested is necessary in order to continue utilizing the structure for its intended purpose. c.  If the urban design commission finds that this requirement of subsection (b) herein is satisfied, they shall consider the following factors in determining whether an economic hardship exemption in whole or in part will be granted: 1.  The present and future income of the property owner(s) and those occupying the property; 2.  The availability, at present or in the future of other sources of income of revenue, including loans, grants, and tax abatements; 3.  The cost associated with adherence to the subarea regulations; 4.  The degree of existing architectural importance and integrity of the structure; and 5.  The purpose and intent of this chapter. d.  The urban design commission shall balance these factors as applied to the applicant for said exemption and shall grant said exemption, in whole or in part, as appropriate to the case upon a finding that the economic hardship to the applicant is significant and substantially outweighs the need for strict adherence to these regulations. (3)  Lot Size, Dimensions and Configurations: In addition to the requirements of the subdivision and zoning ordinances, the compatibility rule specified in this chapter 20J shall apply to all subdivisions and aggregations of lots with regard to lot size, dimensions and configurations. (4)  Duplexes: Notwithstanding any contrary provisions in Part 16 of the Code of Ordinances, new construction of a new two-family or duplex dwelling shall be permitted within this district only as a single building. (5)  Grading: a.  Grading shall not excessively or unnecessarily alter the natural topography of the site, with the exception of grading necessary to protect and preserve the structural integrity of a structure. b.  New grades shall meet existing topography in a smooth transition. (6)  Architectural Standards: a.  Building façades: 1.  All new construction shall conform to the existing building orientation by having porches and front doors facing the front yard. 2.  At a minimum, the front of all new construction, including any portion thereof, shall be placed at the distance from the street determined by the compatibility rule. 3.  There shall be two (2) side yards, one (1) on each side of the principal building, each having a width of not less than the width of the side yards for the block as established by the compatibility rule. 4.  There shall be a rear yard of not less than 10 feet. 5.  All building materials which upon completion are visible from the public right-of-way, shall be compatible with those which predominate in the subarea. 6.  Siding repair or replacement shall match the original materials in scale and direction.

Sec. 16-20K.006. - General regulations.     The following general regulations shall apply to all properties located within the Grant Park Historic District. (1)  General Criteria. (A)  Notwithstanding any other provision herein, no Certificate of Appropriateness shall be required unless, at a minimum, the work would otherwise require a building permit. (B)  Except as otherwise provided herein, the procedures for determining the appropriate type of certificate shall be those specified in section 16-20.008 of the zoning code. (C)  In Residential Subarea I, the commission shall apply the standards referenced in 16.20.009 only if the standards set forth in this Chapter 20K do not specifically address the application. (2)  Certificates of Appropriateness. (A)  Type I Certificates of Appropriateness for ordinary repairs and maintenance shall not be required in this district. Painting or repainting of any structure, or portion thereof, does not require a Certificate of Appropriateness. (B)  Type II Certificates of Appropriateness shall be required for: Minor alterations to those façades of any contributing principal structure that face public streets; fences; walls; accessory structures; decks; and paving. If the proposed alteration meets the requirements of section 16-20K.007, then the director of the commission shall issue the Type II Certificate. If the proposed alteration does not meet the requirements of section 16-20K.007, the director of the commission shall deny the application. Appeals from said decision of the director regarding the issuance and/or denial of Type II Certificates may be taken by any aggrieved person by filing said appeal in the manner prescribed in the appeals section of Chapter 16-20.008(a) for Type I Certificates. (C)  Type III Certificates of Appropriateness shall be required for: 1.  All new principal structures; 2.  All major alterations and additions to existing structure, with respect to any façade that faces a public street. (D)  Type IV Certificates of Appropriateness shall be required for demolition or moving of any contributing principal structure. A partial demolition of a contributing principal structure shall require a Type IV Certificate of Appropriateness only when said partial demolition will result in the loss of significant architectural features which destroys the structure's historic interpretability or importance. (3)  Variances. Variance requests shall be heard by the commission which will have the authority to grant or deny variances from the provisions of this chapter when, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of its provisions in a particular case will result in unnecessary hardship. The procedures, standards, criteria and appeal provisions for decisions regarding such variances shall be the same as those specified in chapter 26 of this Part 16. (4)  Financial Hardship Exemptions. A.  These regulations set forth a minimum standard of architectural compatibility with the rest of the district. However, in order to balance other equally important objectives of economic development, neighborhood revitalization, and prevention of displacement of residents, the commission may allow reasonable exemptions from these regulations to a property owner's principle residence on the ground of economic hardship to the property owner. B.  The burden of proving economic hardship by a preponderance of the evidence shall be on the applicant. C.  The commission shall consider the following factors in determining whether an economic hardship exemption in whole or in part will be granted: 1.  The present income of the property owner(s) and those occupying the property; 2.  The age of the property owner; 3.  The length of time the property owner has resided in the neighborhood or in the residence for which the exemption is sought; 4.  The availability of other sources of funds that are appropriate to the circumstances of the applicant, including loans, grants, and tax abatements; 5.  The costs associated with adherence to these regulations; 6.  The degree of existing architectural significance and integrity of the structure; and 7.  The purpose and intent of this chapter. D.  The commission shall consider these factors and shall grant an exemption, in whole or in part, as appropriate upon a finding that the applicant's economic hardship outweighs the need for strict adherence to these regulations. (5)  Subdivisions. In addition to the requirements of the subdivision and zoning ordinances, including but not limited to sections 15-08.002(a)(2) and 15-08.005(d)(6), all subdivisions of lots shall conform to the historic platting pattern in the district with regard to lot size, dimensions, and configurations. (6)  Tree Preservation and Replacement. The provisions of City of Atlanta Tree Ordinance, Atlanta City Code section 158-26, shall apply to this district. (7)  Paved surfaces: The original layout, patterns and paving materials of sidewalks, curbs and streets shall be retained. (Ord.

Sec. 16-20L.005. - General regulations.     The following general regulations shall apply to all properties located within the Inman Park Historic District. 1.  General criteria. a.  Except as otherwise provided herein, the procedures for determining the appropriate type of certificate of appropriateness shall be those specified in section 16-20.008 of the Zoning Code. b.  In the Inman Park Historic District, the commission shall apply the standards referenced below only if the standards set forth elsewhere in this chapter 20L do not specifically address the application including multi-family residential, institutional, commercial, industrial and mixed use structures in Subarea 1: i.  A property shall be used as it was historically or be given a new use that requires minimal change to its distinctive materials, features, spaces, and spatial relationships. ii.  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize a property shall be avoided. iii.  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes shall not be undertaken that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or elements from other historic properties. iv.  Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. v.  Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques, or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property, shall be preserved. vi.  Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, texture, and, where possible, materials. vii.  Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. viii.  Archaeological resources shall be protected and preserved in place. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken. ix.  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction, shall not destroy historic materials, features, and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new work may be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, scale and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its environment. x.  New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. c.  New construction in Subarea 2 and in Subarea 3: Contemporary design for new construction and for additions to existing properties shall not be discouraged when such new construction and additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural, or cultural material, and such construction or additions satisfy section 16-20L.007 or section 16-20L.008, as applicable. d.  Compatibility rule: i.  The intent of the mayor and council in establishing the regulations of the Inman Park Historic District is to ensure that alterations to existing structures, and new construction, in Subarea 1 and alterations to existing contributing structures in Subarea 2 and Subarea 3 are compatible with the historic design, scale, and general character of the entire district as it existed in 1945, of the contributing structures in each subarea, and of the contributing structures in the immediately adjacent environment of a particular block face; and further, to ensure that lot platting in Subarea 1 is compatible with the historic platting pattern of Subarea 1 and of a particular block face as it existed in 1945. ii.  To further that intent and simultaneously permit flexibility in design, the regulations provide a compatibility rule which is as follows: (a)  Where quantifiable (i.e. building height, setback, etc.), the element or building characteristic in question shall be no less than the smallest such element or building characteristic of buildings or site layouts in that block face that characterizes such like contributing buildings and shall be internally consistent with the historic design of the structure and shall be no greater than the greatest such element or building characteristic of buildings or site layouts in that block face that characterizes such like contributing buildings or site layouts and shall be internally consistent with the historic design of the structure. (b)  Where not quantifiable (roof form, architectural trim, etc.) it shall be compatible with that which predominates in contributing structures on that block face and shall be internally consistent with the historic design of the structure. e.  Initial plan review for proposed improvements in Subareas 2 and 3. Prior to submission of any development plans involving new construction including any addition to any existing building that otherwise requires review by the commission, such plans shall first be submitted to and reviewed by the bureau of planning for conformance with the zoning requirements of Subarea 2 or 3 as applies. The director of the bureau of planning shall review said plans and shall transmit to the director of the urban design commission in writing within 30 days of receipt of such plans a written statement as to whether or not in the planning director's opinion, such plans are in conformance with the zoning requirements imposed within Subarea 2 or within Subarea 3, as is applicable. f.  Building height shall be measured on the front elevation from the average point of grade on the front elevation to the highest point of the roof or façade, whichever is higher. 2.  Certificates of appropriateness. a.  Notwithstanding any other provision herein, no certificate of appropriateness shall be required unless, at a minimum, the work would otherwise require a building permit. b.  Type I certificates of appropriateness for ordinary repairs and maintenance shall not be required in this district. Painting or repainting of any structure or portion thereof does not require a certificate of appropriateness. c.  Type II certificates of appropriateness shall be reviewed by the director of the commission and shall be required for: i.  All alterations to existing structures where visible from a public street or park, unless such alterations or additions are specifically exempted from certificates of appropriateness in the subarea regulations. ii.  Fences, walls, accessory structures, decks, rear porches, and paving. iii.  If a Type II certificate of appropriateness is required and the proposed alteration meets the requirements of section 16-20L.006, section 16-20L.007, or section 1620L.008, as applicable, the director of the commission shall issue Type II certificate within 14 days of the application. iv.  If a Type II certificate of appropriateness is required and the proposed alteration does not meet the requirements of section 16-20L.006, section 16-20L.007, or section 16-20L.008, as applicable, the director of the commission shall deny the application with notice to the applicant within 14 days of the application. v.  Appeals from any such decision of the director regarding the approval and/or denial of Type II certificates may be taken by any aggrieved person by filing an appeal in the manner prescribed in the appeals section of Chapter 16-20.008(a) for Type I certificates. d.  Type III certificates of appropriateness shall he reviewed by the commission and shall be required for: i.  All new principal structures. ii.  Additions that are visible from a public street or park, unless such additions are specifically exempted from a certificate of appropriateness in the subarea regulations. iii.  Revisions to previously approved plans that result in an increase in floor area ratio, lot coverage, height or a change in the building footprint. iv.  Subdivisions, consolidations, and replats as required per section 16-20L.005(5). v.  Variances and special exceptions. e.  Type IV certificates of appropriateness shall be required for demolition or moving of any contributing principal structure. A partial demolition of a contributing principal structure shall require a Type IV certificate of appropriateness only when said partial demolition will result in the loss of significant architectural features that destroys the structure's historic interpretability or importance. 3.  Variances, special exceptions, and appeals. Variance applications, applications for special exceptions, and appeals from these regulations shall be heard by the commission. The commission shall have the authority to grant or deny variances from the provisions of this chapter when, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of its provisions in a particular case will result in unnecessary hardship. The procedures, standards, and criteria for decisions regarding such variances shall be the same as those specified in chapter 26 of this Part 16. The commission shall have the authority to grant or deny applications for special exceptions pursuant to the standards in chapter 25. The commission shall have the authority to grant or deny applications for appeal pursuant to the standards in section 16-30.010 and the appeal provisions for said decision, set forth in section 16-30.010(e), shall also apply to the commission's decision. 4.  Financial hardship exemptions. a.  These regulations set forth a minimum standard of architectural compatibility with the rest of the district. However, in order to balance other equally important objectives of economic development, neighborhood revitalization, and prevention of displacement of residents, the commission may allow reasonable exemptions from these regulations for Type II certificates of appropriateness for repair only to a property owner's principal residence on the ground of economic hardship to the property owner. b.  The burden of proving economic hardship by a preponderance of the evidence shall be on the applicant. c.  The commission shall consider the following factors in determining whether an economic hardship exemption in whole or in part will be granted: i.  The present income of the property owner(s) and those occupying the property; ii.  The age of the property owner; iii.  The length of time the property owner has resided in the neighborhood or in the residence for which the exemption is sought; iv.  The availability of other sources of funds that are appropriate to the circumstances of the applicant, including loans, grants, and tax abatements; v.  The costs associated with adherence to these regulations; vi.  The degree of existing architectural significance and integrity of the structure; and vii.  The purpose and intent of this chapter. d.  The commission shall consider these factors. If it finds that the applicant's economic hardship outweighs the need for strict adherence to these regulations it shall grant an exemption, in whole or in part, as appropriate. 5.  Subdivisions or consolidations. a.  In Subarea 1, the platting pattern of the lnman Park Historic District is an integral part of the historic character of the district. No subdivision or consolidation shall be approved unless it can be shown that the proposed subdivision or consolidation is substantially consistent with the historic character of the district. In addition to the requirements of the subdivision and zoning ordinances, including but not limited to sections 15-08.002(a)(2) and 15-08.005(d)(6), all subdivisions or consolidations of lots shall conform to the historic platting pattern in the Inman Park Historic District with regard to lot size, dimensions, and configurations. The compatibility rule shall apply, and no subdivision or consolidation shall be approved unless and until the urban design commission has made a finding that it is consistent with this provision or with the platting pattern of the neighborhood, as it existed in 1945. b.  In Subarea II and III, no replat to create additional lots or consolidation shall be approved unless and until the commission has made a finding that the proposed replat or consolidation will result in lots that would allow for future development that would meet the district and subarea regulations without the need for variance or special exception. The commission may make such a finding independent of or concurrently with the review of proposed new construction, alterations, or additions on those same lots. 6.  Tree preservation and replacement. The provisions of the City of Atlanta Tree Ordinance, Atlanta City Code section 158-26, shall apply to this district. 7.  Any time the provision 16-20.011 (b) of this part is enforced in this district, the director of the commission shall notify the Inman Park Neighborhood Association within ten days and a 30-day period for comment be allowed for the association. Further, the director shall regularly send to the Inman Park Neighborhood Association the agenda for each regular meeting and for any special meeting of the commission in which there is any agenda item for property located within the Inman Park Historic District. (Ord.

No. 2003-102, § 3(Att. C), 11-10-03) 
Sec. 16-20M.002. - Scope of regulations. (1)  The existing zoning map and regulations governing all properties within the Oakland City Historic District shall remain in full force and effect. The following zoning regulations (Chapter 20M) shall be overlaid upon, and shall be imposed in addition to, said existing zoning regulations. Whenever the following regulations conflict with said existing zoning regulations, the following regulations (Chapter 20M) shall apply. (2)  Except when otherwise explicitly provided, the provisions of Chapter 20 of this part shall apply to this district.

Sec. 16-20M.005. - Compatibility rule.     The intent of the mayor and council in establishing the regulations of the Oakland City Historic District is to ensure that all work requiring a certificate of appropriateness is compatible with the historic design, scale, and general character of the entire district and of the contributing structures in the immediately adjacent environment of a particular block face. To further that intent and simultaneously permit flexibility in design, the regulations provide a compatibility rule which is as follows: Where quantifiable (i.e. building height, setback, etc.), the element or building characteristic in question shall be no less than the smallest such element or building characteristic of buildings or site layouts in that block face that characterizes such like contributing buildings and shall be internally consistent with the historic design of the structure and shall be no greater than the greatest such element or building characteristic of buildings or site layouts in that block face that characterizes such like contributing buildings or site layouts and shall be internally consistent with the historic design of the structure. Where not quantifiable (roof form, architectural trim, etc.), the element or building characteristic in question shall be compatible with that which predominates in such like contributing structures on that block face and shall be internally consistent with the historic design of the structure. (Ord. No. 2003-102, § 3(Att. C), 11-10-03) 
Sec. 16-20M.006. - General criteria. (1)  Notwithstanding any other provision herein, no certificate of appropriateness shall be required unless, at a minimum, the work would otherwise require a building permit. (2)  Except as otherwise provided herein, the procedures for determining the appropriate type of certificate shall be those specified in section 16-20.008 of the Zoning Code. (3)  The commission shall apply the standards referenced in 16.20.009 only if the standards set forth in this Chapter 20M do not specifically address the application. (Ord.

Sec. 16-20M.007. - Certificates of appropriateness. (1)  Type I certificates of appropriateness for ordinary repairs and maintenance shall not be required in this district. Painting or repainting of any structure, or portion thereof, does not require a certificate of appropriateness. (2)  Type II certificates of appropriateness shall be required for: minor alterations to any principal structure when the alterations are visible from a public street; and the construction of fences, walls, accessory structures, decks, and paving. If the proposed alteration meets the requirements of section 16-20M.007, then the director of the commission shall issue the Type II certificate of appropriateness within 14 days of application for such certificate. If the proposed alteration does not meet the requirements of section 16-20M.012 and .013, the director of the commission shall deny the application. Appeals from said decision of the director regarding the issuance and/or denial of Type II certificates of appropriateness may be taken by any aggrieved person by filing said appeal in the manner prescribed in the appeals section of Chapter 16-20.008(a) for Type I certificates of appropriateness. (3)  Type III certificates of appropriateness shall be required for: (a)  Construction of all new principal structures; (b)  All major alterations and additions to an existing structure, when the alterations or additions are visible from a public street. (4)  Type IV certificates of appropriateness shall be required for demolition or moving of any contributing principal structure.

No. 2003-102, § 3(Att. C), 11-10-03) 
Sec. 16-20M.008. - Variances.     Variance requests shall be heard by the commission which will have the authority to grant or deny variances from the provisions of this chapter when, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of its provisions in a particular case will result in unnecessary hardship. The procedures, standards, criteria, and appeal provisions for decisions regarding such variances shall be the same as those specified in chapter 26 of this Part 16. (Ord. No. 2003-102, § 3(Att. C), 11-10-03) 
Sec. 16-20M.009. - Financial hardship exemptions. (1)  These regulations set forth a minimum standard of architectural compatibility with the rest of the district. However, in order to balance other equally important objectives of economic development, neighborhood revitalization, and prevention of displacement of residents, the commission may allow reasonable exemptions from these regulations to a property owner's principle residence on the grounds of economic hardship to the property owner. (2)  The burden of proving economic hardship by a preponderance of the evidence shall be on the applicant. (3)  The commission shall consider the following factors in determining whether an economic hardship exemption in whole or in part will be granted: (a)  The present income of the property owner(s) and those occupying the property; (b)  The age of the property owner; (c)  The length of time the property owner has resided in the neighborhood or in the residence for which the exemption is sought; (d)  The availability of other sources of funds that are appropriate to the circumstances of the applicant, including loans, grants, and tax abatements; (e)  The costs associated with adherence to these regulations; (f)  The degree of existing architectural significance and integrity of the structure; and (g)  The purpose and intent of this chapter. (4)  The commission shall consider these factors and shall grant an exemption, in whole or in part, as appropriate upon a finding that the applicant's economic hardship outweighs the need for strict adherence to these regulations. (Ord. No. 2003-102, § 3(Att. C), 11-10-03) 
Sec. 16-20M.010. - Subdivisions.     In addition to the requirements of the subdivision and zoning ordinances, including but not limited to sections 15-08.002(a)(2) and 15-08.005(d)(6), all subdivisions of lots shall conform to the historic platting pattern in the district established during the period of significance from 1867 to 1955 with regard to lot size, dimensions, and configurations. (Ord.

It is not the intent of these regulations to limit the design of new housing to replication of styles of existing structures, but to foster residential design that, with regard to massing, size, scale, materials, and architectural elements, enhances the architectural quality of the neighborhood and simultaneously encourages creativity. Additionally, these regulations are intended to integrate the physical characteristics of new construction into the existing neighborhood in a meaningful way so as to restore and promote the public health, safety, and welfare of this neighborhood. The following residential architectural styles currently predominate in the neighborhood and contribute to its unique historic character; they are included here for reference only: American Four Square, Craftsman, English Vernacular Revival, Folk Victorian, Queen Anne, and Minimal Traditional Cottages. (2)  Design standards and criteria for new principal structures. (a)  No individual house design shall substantially repeat a design of a new principal structure on the block face that was approved by the commission since the adoption of this district. (b)  An unpaved planting strip adjacent and parallel to the public street shall be provided. The compatibility rule shall apply to the dimensions and design of planting strips. (c)  A sidewalk between the planting strip and the required front yard and parallel to the public street shall be provided. The sidewalk shall be the same width as the sidewalk on abutting properties or it shall be the width otherwise required by city ordinance, whichever is greater.

Sec. 16-20N.007. - General regulations.     The following general regulations shall apply to all properties located within the district. 1.  [Standards.] In the district, the commission shall apply the standards referenced below only if the standards set forth elsewhere in this chapter 20N do not specifically address the application or any portion of the application: (a)  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. (b)  The removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize a property shall be avoided. (c)  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes shall not be undertaken that create a false sense of historic development, such as adding conjectural features or elements from other historic properties. (d)  Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. (e)  Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques, or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property, shall be preserved. (f)  Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, texture, and, where possible, materials. (g)  Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. (h)  Archaeological resources shall be protected and preserved in place. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken. (i)  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction, shall not destroy historic materials, features, and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new work may be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, scale and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its environment. (j)  New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. (k)  Contemporary design for new construction and for additions to existing properties shall not be discouraged when such new construction and additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural, or cultural material, and such construction or additions satisfy section 16-20N.008 or section 16-20N.009, as applicable. (l)  The height of a structure shall be measured on the façade facing the public street and measurement shall be taken from the highest point of such grade to the top of the parapet wall. 2.  Compatibility rule. (a)  The intent of the regulations and guidelines is to ensure that alterations and additions to existing structures and new construction are compatible with the design, proportions, scale, and general character of the block face, the entire block, a particular subarea or the district as a whole. To permit flexibility, some regulations are made subject to the compatibility rule, which states: "Where not quantifiable, the element in question (building proportion, roof form, fenestration, etc.) shall match that which predominates on the contributing buildings in the subarea. Where quantifiable, the element in question (i.e., distance of first floor above sidewalk grade), shall be no smaller than the smallest or larger than the largest such dimensions of the contributing buildings in the subarea." (b)  Those elements to which the rule applies are noted in the regulations by a reference to the "compatibility rule." 3.  Variances, special exceptions, and appeals. Variance applications, applications for special exceptions, and appeals from these regulations shall be heard by the commission. The commission shall have the authority to grant or deny variances from the provisions of this chapter when, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of its provisions in a particular case will result in unnecessary hardship. The procedures, standards, and criteria for decisions regarding such variances shall be the same as those specified in chapter 26 of this Part 16. The commission shall have the authority to grant or deny applications for special exceptions pursuant to the standards in chapter 25. The commission shall have the authority to grant or deny applications for appeal pursuant to the standards in section 16-30.010 and the appeal provisions for said decision, set forth in section 16-30.010(e), shall also apply to the commission's decision. 4.  Financial hardship exemptions. (a)  These regulations set forth a minimum standard of architectural compatibility with the rest of the district. However, in order to balance other equally important objectives of economic development, neighborhood revitalization, and prevention of displacement of residents, the commission may allow reasonable exemptions from these regulations to a property owner's principal residence on the ground of economic hardship to the property owner. (b)  The burden of proving economic hardship by a preponderance of the evidence shall be on the applicant. (c)  The commission shall consider the following factors in determining whether an economic hardship exemption in whole or in part will be granted: i.  The present income of the property owner(s) and those occupying the property. ii.  The age of the property owner. iii.  The length of time the property owner has resided in the neighborhood or in the residence for which the exemption is sought. iv.  The availability of other sources of funds that are appropriate to the circumstances of the applicant, including loans, grants and tax abatements. v.  The costs associated with adherence to these regulations. vi.  The degree of existing architectural significance and integrity of the structure; and vii.  The purpose and intent of this chapter. (d)  The commission shall consider these factors and shall grant an exemption, in whole or in part, as appropriate upon a finding that the applicant's economic hardship outweighs the need for strict adherence to these regulations. 5.  Subdivisions of lots. The subdivision of any lot within this district shall be subject to review and approval by the commission. No subdivision of lots shall be approved by the director of the bureau of planning unless said matter has first been submitted to and approved by the commission. The commission shall find that the resulting lots are so laid out that buildings that are compatible in design, proportion, scale, and general character of a particular subarea or the district as a whole, may be reasonably situated and constructed upon such lots. 6.  Aggregation of lots. No lots shall be aggregated except upon approval of the commission. Applications shall be made to the commission. The commission shall find that the resulting lots are so laid out that buildings that are compatible in design, proportion, scale, and general character of the subarea, and the district as a whole, may be reasonably situated and constructed upon such lots. 7.  Tree preservation and replacement. The provisions of the City of Atlanta Tree Ordinance, Atlanta City Code section 158-26, shall apply to this district. 8.  Off-street and off-site parking. (a)  All new construction, alterations, or additions that increase the number of dwelling units and/or increase the square footage of nonresidential uses, or any change in use shall include the required off-street parking. (b)  The number of required off-street parking spaces is set out in each subarea. (c)  Off-street or off-site parking located adjacent to public streets or sidewalks shall include landscape buffer strips along the public street or sidewalk. Landscape buffer strips shall be: a minimum of three feet in width, planted with a mixture of evergreen groundcover or shrubs a minimum of three gallons at time of planting with a maximum mature height of 30 inches; and planted with canopy street trees that are a minimum of 3.5 inch caliper measured 36 inches above ground and a minimum of 12 feet in height at time of planting placed no further than 25 feet on center. All landscape buffer strips shall be maintained in a sightly manner. (d)  Use of shared driveways and/or alleys is encouraged.

Sec. 16-20O.006. - General regulations.     The following general regulations shall apply to all properties located within the Atkins Park Historic District. (1)  Certificates of appropriateness. (A)  Except as otherwise provided herein, the procedures for determining the appropriate type of certificate of appropriateness shall be those specified in section 16-20.008 of the Code of Ordinances. (B)  Notwithstanding any other provision herein, no certificate of appropriateness shall be required unless, at a minimum, the work would otherwise require a building permit. (C)  Type I certificates of appropriateness for ordinary repairs and maintenance shall not be required in this district. For example, painting or repainting of any structure or portion thereof, or roof or driveway repair using same materials, do not require a certificate of appropriateness. (D)  Type II certificates of appropriateness shall be required for any of the following to the extent they are visible from a public street: Any minor alteration to any façade of any principal structure, fences, walls, retaining walls, decks, skylights, solar panels, mechanical and communication equipment, shutters, awnings, accessory structures or paving. If a Type II certificate of appropriateness is required and the proposed alteration meets the requirements of this chapter, as applicable and other criteria applicable to Type II certificates, the director of the commission shall issue the Type II certificate within 14 days of receipt of the completed application. If a Type II certificate of appropriateness is required and the proposed alteration does not meet the requirements of this chapter, as applicable, the director of the commission shall deny the application with notice to the applicant within 14 days of receipt of the completed application. Appeals from any such decision of the director regarding the approval and/or denial of Type II certificates may be taken by any aggrieved person by filing an appeal in the manner prescribed in the appeals section of chapter 16-20.008(a) for Type I certificates. (E)  Type III certificates of appropriateness shall be required for: (i)  All new principal structures. (ii)  All major alterations and additions to existing structures. (iii)  Subdivisions or aggregations of lots, and planned developments. (F)  Type IV certificates of appropriateness shall be required for demolition, moving, or major alterations or additions to any principal structure, or existing gateway, or portions thereof. (2)  Variances. Variance applications shall be heard by the urban design commission. The commission shall have the authority to grant or deny variances from the provisions of this chapter when, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of its provisions in a particular case will result in unnecessary hardship. The procedures, standards, and criteria for decisions regarding such variances shall be the same as those specified in chapter 26 of this Part 16.     Zoning variances granted prior to enactment of this chapter. Any owner of property who obtained, on or after January 1, 1982, and prior to the effective date of this chapter, a variance from the city board of zoning adjustment to construct all or a portion of a project within the boundaries of this district, shall be entitled to construct said project in accordance with the plans presented in said application, the provisions of section 16-20O.007 notwithstanding. (3)  Financial hardship exemptions. (A)  These regulations set forth a minimum standard of architectural compatibility with the rest of the district. However, in order to balance other equally important objectives of neighborhood revitalization and prevention of displacement of residents, the commission may allow reasonable exemptions from these regulations on the ground of economic hardship to the property owner. (B)  The burden of proving economic hardship by a preponderance of the evidence shall be on the applicant. (C)  The commission shall consider the following factors in determining whether an economic hardship exemption in whole or in part will be granted: i.  The present income of the property owner(s) and those occupying the property; ii.  The age of the property owner; iii.  The length of time the property owner has resided in the neighborhood or in the residence for which the exemption is sought; iv.  The availability of other sources of funds that are appropriate to the circumstances of the applicant, including loans, grants, and tax abatements; v.  The costs associated with adherence to these regulations; vi.  The degree of existing architectural significance and integrity of the structure; and vii.  The purpose and intent of this chapter. (D)  The commission shall consider these factors. If it finds that the applicant's economic hardship outweighs the need for strict adherence to these regulations it shall grant an exemption, in whole or in part, as appropriate. (4)  Subdivisions and aggregation of lots. The platting pattern of the Atkins Park Historic District is an integral part of the historic character of the district. No subdivision or aggregation shall be approved unless it can be shown that the proposal is substantially consistent with the original plan of the district. In addition to the requirements of the subdivision and zoning ordinances, including but not limited to sections 15-08.002(a)(2) and 15-08.005(d)(6), all subdivisions and aggregations of lots shall conform to the historic platting pattern in the Atkins Historic District with regard to area of lot, dimensions, and configurations. (5)  Tree preservation and replacement. The provisions of the City of Atlanta Tree Ordinance, Atlanta City Code section 158-26 et seq., (Code 1977, as amended), shall apply to this district.     In addition to the Tree Ordinance, a Type III Certificate of Appropriateness to remove or destroy any tree having a diameter at breast height of 6 inches or greater for safety, landscaping, silviculture, construction, renovation or demolition shall be obtained prior to commencement of work. Trees determined to be dead, dying or hazardous are not subject to the certificate of appropriateness procedures. The application shall include a tree plan indicating the following: (A)  Location of all existing trees with type and diameter indicated, including boundary trees; (B)  Location of all existing trees to be saved indicated; and (C)  Location of all proposed trees located with type and diameter indicated. (6)  Alleys and by-ways. (A)  Existing alleys and by-ways shall be maintained as part of the historic platting pattern. Alleys shall remain open for pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Byways shall remain open for pedestrian traffic only. (7)  Compatibility rule. (A)  In general, the intent of the regulations and guidelines is to ensure that alterations to existing structures and new construction are compatible with the design, proportions, scale, massing, materials, and general character of the contributing buildings in the immediately adjacent environment of the block face, the entire block, or the district as a whole. Synthetic materials may be used if visually indistinguishable from the original materials. To permit flexibility, many regulations are made subject to the compatibility rule, which states: "The element in question (roof form, architectural trim, etc.) shall match that which predominates on the contributing buildings of the same block face or, where quantifiable (i.e., buildings height and width as measured at front façade, floor height, lot dimensions, etc.), no smaller than the smallest or larger than the largest such dimension of the contributing buildings of the same block face." (B)  Those elements to which the rule applies are noted in the regulations by a reference to the "compatibility rule." (Ord. No. 2007-41(07-O-0862), § 3, 7-5-07)

CHAPTER 20P. - SUNSET AVENUE HISTORIC DISTRICT 
Sec. 16-20P.001. - Statement of intent.     The intent of the regulations for the Sunset Avenue Historic District is as follows: 1.  To enhance and integrate land use regulations, tailored to the historic character of this district, with existing land use regulations; 2.  To preserve the district's historic pattern and distribution of building types that are characterized primarily by single-family residences, institutions, and neighborhood commercial buildings, which were constructed from the late 19th century to the mid-20th century; 3.  To preserve the residential character of the street, including the spatial relationships between buildings, and the spatial relationship between buildings and the street; 4.  To preserve the historic street and lot pattern and design, that are significant elements of the district; 5.  To ensure that new development is consistent with the historic character of the district; 6.  To encourage neighborhood revitalization and prevent the displacement of residents; and 7.  To preserve and enhance the historic and architectural appearance of the district so as to substantially promote the public health, safety and general welfare. (Ord. No. 2011-19(11-O-0447), § 1, 5-25-11) 
Sec. 16-20P.002. - Scope of regulations. 1.  The existing zoning map and regulations governing all properties within the Sunset Avenue Historic District shall remain in full force and effect. The following zoning regulations shall be overlaid upon, and shall be imposed in addition to, said existing zoning regulations. 2.  All other statutes, rules, regulations, ordinances, or other governmentally adopted regulations pertaining to properties within this district shall continue to apply; and any variance between said other regulations and these overlay district regulations (Chapter 20P) shall be governed by the interpretation provision set forth in section 16-20.011(c) of the Code of Ordinances. (Ord. No. 2011-19(11-O-0447), § 1, 5-25-11) 
Sec. 16-20P.003. - Boundaries. 1.  The boundaries of the Sunset Avenue Historic District constitute an overlay Historic District (HD) zoning district, which district shall be as shown on the official zoning map adopted herewith entitled the "Sunset Avenue Historic District" and described as follows: south boundary on the east side of Sunset Avenue is the south property line of 685 Rhodes Street, and on the west side of Sunset Avenue is the south property line of 126 Sunset Avenue; west boundary is the rear property lines of the lots on the west side of Sunset Avenue; north boundary on the west side is north property line of 320 Sunset Avenue; north boundary on the east side is the north property line of 303 Sunset Avenue; east boundary is the rear property lines of the lots on the east side of Sunset Avenue. (Ord. No. 2011-19(11-O-0447), § 1, 5-25-11) 
Sec. 16-20P.004. - Organization.     The overlay zoning regulations for the Sunset Avenue Historic District are composed of two parts. The first part consists of general regulations which apply to all property located within this district. The second part consists of specific regulations. (Ord. No. 2011-19(11-O-0447), § 1, 5-25-11) 
Sec. 16-20P.005. - General regulations.     The following regulations shall apply to all properties within the Sunset Avenue Historic District. 1.  General criteria: a.  The commission shall apply the standards referenced below if the standards set forth elsewhere in this Chapter 20P do not specifically address the application, including but not limited to commercial properties in the district: (1)  A property shall be used as it was historically or be given a new use that requires minimal change to its distinctive materials, features and exterior spatial relationships. (2)  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features, and exterior spatial relationships that characterize a property shall be avoided. (3)  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes shall not be undertaken that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or elements from other historic properties or eras. (4)  Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. (5)  Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques, or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property, shall be preserved. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, texture, and, where possible, materials. (6)  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction, shall not destroy historic materials, features, and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new work may be differentiated from the old, but shall be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, massing, scale and proportion, to protect the integrity of the property and its environment. (7)  New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 2.  The compatibility rule: a.  In general, the intent of the regulations and guidelines is to ensure that alterations to existing structures and new construction are compatible with the design, proportions, scale, massing, and general character of (i) the structure itself, (ii) the contributing buildings in the entire block, and (iii) the contributing buildings in the subarea. b.  The compatibility rule is a method of requiring that alterations and new construction are sensitive and sympathetic to existing elements of the immediate environment constituting a particular block. In accordance with this purpose, the compatibility rule is as follows: "The elements in question (roof form, architectural trim, etc.) shall match that which predominates on the contributing buildings of the same block face, or where quantifiable (i.e., buildings height and width as measured at front façade, floor height, lot dimensions, etc.), no smaller than the smallest or larger than the largest such dimension of the contributing buildings of the same block face." c.  To permit flexibility, many regulations are made subject to the compatibility rule. Those elements to which the compatibility rule applies are specified in regulations by reference to the "compatibility rule." 3.  Certificates of appropriateness: a.  When required: (1)  To change the exterior appearance of any portion of a structure within the district, when said change can be seen from the public right-of-way; (2)  To erect a new structure or to make an addition to any structure within the district, when said addition can be seen from public right-of-way; (3)  To demolish or move any contributing principal structure, in whole or in part, within the district; and (4)  Site work. b.  Type required: (1)  Except as otherwise provided herein, the procedures for determining the appropriate type of certificate of appropriateness shall be those specified in section 16-20.008 of the Code of Ordinances. (2)  Notwithstanding any other provision herein, no certificate of appropriateness shall be required unless, at a minimum, the work would otherwise require a building permit. (3)  Type I certificates of appropriateness for ordinary repairs and maintenance are not required in this district. This exemption in no way obviates the requirements for certificates of appropriateness set forth in this section. (4)  The following Type II certificates of appropriateness shall be reviewed by the director of the commission and shall be required for any of the following: (a)  Fences, walls, and retaining walls; (b)  Decks, skylights, solar panels, and mechanical and communication equipment if visible from the public right-of-way; (c)  New accessory structures and alterations to existing accessory structures; (d)  Shutters and awnings if visible from the public right-of-way; (e)  Replacement of non-original, non-historic or missing elements with elements that otherwise meet the regulations, including but not limited to: siding, windows, porch railings, porch columns, porch flooring, exterior doors, if visible from the public right-of-way, and (f)  Paving. If a Type II certificate of appropriateness is required and the proposed alteration meets the requirements of this chapter, as applicable, and other criteria applicable to Type II certificates, the director of the commission shall issue the Type II certificate within 14 days of receipt of the completed application. If a Type II certificate of appropriateness is required and the proposed alteration does not meet the requirements of this chapter, as applicable, the director of the commission shall deny the application with notice to the applicant within 14 days of receipt of the completed application. Appeals from any such decision of the director regarding the approval and/or denial of Type II certificates may be taken by any aggrieved person by filing an appeal in the manner prescribed in the appeals section of section 16-20.008(a) for Type I certificates. (5)  The following Type II certificates of appropriateness shall be reviewed by the commission and shall be required for any of the following to the extent they are visible from the public right-of-way: (a)  Alterations to any façade of any principal structure; and (b)  All site work, except as noted in section 16-20P.005(3)(b)(4). (6)  The following Type III certificates of appropriateness shall be reviewed by the commission and shall be required for: (a)  All new principal structures; (b)  Additions visible from the public right-of-way; (c)  Revisions to previously approved plans that result in an increase in floor area ratio, lot coverage, height or a change in the building footprint; (d)  Subdivisions and aggregations; and (e)  Variances. (7)  Type IV certificates of appropriateness shall be reviewed by the commission and required for demolition or moving of any contributing principal structure. A partial demolition of a contributing principal structure shall require a Type IV certificate of appropriateness only when said partial demolition will result in the loss of significant architectural features that destroys the structure's historic interpretability or importance of the front façade. 4.  Variances and special exceptions: The urban design commission shall have the power to hear, grant and deny variances from the provisions of this chapter when, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of its provisions in a particular case will result in unnecessary hardship. The procedures, standards, criteria, and appeal provisions for decisions regarding such variances shall be the same as those specified in Chapter 26 of this Part 16. The commission shall have the authority to grant or deny applications for special exceptions pursuant to the standards in Chapter 25 of this part. 5.  Subdivision and aggregation of lots: The subdivision of any lot within this district shall be subject to review and approval by the commission. No subdivision of lots shall be approved by the director of the office of planning unless said matter has first been submitted to and approved by the commission. No lots shall be aggregated except upon approval of the commission. Applications shall be made to the commission, and the commission shall not approve any subdivision or aggregation of lots unless the commission shall make a finding that the resulting lot or lots are compatible with the historic platting pattern of Sunset Avenue as it existed in 1968 and meet the compatibility rule with regard to lot size, dimensions and configuration. 6.  Financial hardship exemptions: a.  These regulations set forth a minimum standard of architectural compatibility within the district. However, in order to balance this concern with other equally important objectives in the district, including economic development, neighborhood revitalization, and prevention of displacement of residents, the urban design commission may allow reasonable exemptions from these regulations on the ground of economic hardship to the property owner. The burden of proof that the regulations and guidelines pose such a hardship shall be on the property owner. b.  In order to qualify for an economic hardship exemption, the applicant(s) must first make a showing that the alteration(s) requested is necessary in order to continue utilizing the structure for its intended purpose. c.  If the urban design commission finds that this requirement of subsection (b) herein is satisfied, they shall consider the following factors in determining whether an economic hardship exemption in whole or in part will be granted: (1)  The present and future income of the property owner(s) and those occupying the property; (2)  The availability, at present or in the future of other sources of income of revenue, including loans, grants, and tax abatements; (3)  The cost associated with adherence to the subarea regulations; (4)  The degree of existing architectural importance and integrity of the structure; (5)  The purpose and intent of this chapter. d.  The urban design commission shall balance these factors as applied to the applicant for said exemption and shall grant said exemption, in whole or in part, as appropriate to the case upon a finding that the economic hardship to the applicant is significant and substantially outweighs the need for strict adherence to these regulations. (Ord. No. 2011-19(11-O-0447), § 3(Att. C), 5-25-11)

If a Type II certificate of appropriateness is required and the proposed alteration does not meet the requirements of this chapter, as applicable, the director of the commission shall deny the application with notice to the applicant sent within 14 days of receipt of the completed application. Appeals from any such decision of the director regarding the approval and/or denial of Type II certificates may be taken by any aggrieved person by filing an appeal in the manner prescribed in the appeals section of chapter 16-20.008(a) for Type I certificates. (v)  The following shall require a Type II certificates of appropriateness which shall be reviewed by the commission: (a)  To alter a principal structure, except as noted in section I6-20Q.005 (2)(d)(iv); (b)  Revisions to Type II certificate of appropriateness applications previously approved, conditionally or otherwise, by the commission; and (c)  All site work, except as noted in section 16-20Q.005(1)(b)(iv). (vi)  The following shall require a Type III certificates of appropriateness which shall be reviewed by the commission: (a)  All new principal structures; (b)  Additions to principal structure; (c)  Revisions to Type III certificate of appropriateness applications previously approved by the commission, conditionally or otherwise, including but not limited to changes in floor area ratio, lot coverage, setback, building footprint, or building height; (d)  Subdivisions and consolidations of lots; and (e)  Variances or special exceptions from this chapter 20Q. (vii)  Type IV certificates of appropriateness shall be reviewed by the commission and shall be required for the demolition or moving of any contributing principal structure. A partial demolition of a contributing principal structure shall require a Type IV certificate of appropriateness only when said partial demolition will result in the loss of significant architectural features that destroys the structure's historic interpretability or importance, as determined by the commission. (3)  The compatibility rule. In general, the intent of the regulations and guidelines is to ensure that alterations to existing structures and new construction are compatible with the design, proportions, scale, massing, and general character of the contributing buildings in the immediately adjacent environment of the block face, the entire block, or the district as a whole. To permit flexibility, many regulations are made subject to the compatibility rule, which states: "The element in question (i.e. roof form, architectural trim, façade material, window type and material, etc.) shall match that which predominates on the contributing buildings of the same architectural style and like use on that block face or, where quantifiable (i.e., buildings height, setbacks, lot dimensions, etc.), no smaller than the smallest or larger than the largest such dimension of the contributing buildings of the same architectural style and like use on that block face." (a)  For the purposes of the compatibility rule, height and width shall be measured at the front façade. (b)  Those elements to which the rule applies are noted in the regulations by a reference to the "compatibility rule." (c)  When no structure exists on a block face that would qualify as a comparable structure under the compatibility rule, the comparisons shall be made to a qualifying structure(s) on the block, and if no such structure exists on the block, the comparison shall be made to a qualifying structure(s) on an adjacent block race or block, and if no such structure exists on an adjacent block face or block, the comparison shall be made to a qualifying structure(s) located in the district. (4)  Variances and special exceptions. The commission shall have the power to hear, grant and deny variances and special exceptions from the provisions of this chapter (20Q) when, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of its provisions in a particular case will result in unnecessary hardship other then financial hardship. The procedures, standards, criteria, and appeal provisions for decisions regarding such variances and special exceptions shall be the same as those specified in chapter 26 of this Part 16, which provisions are hereby incorporated herein. (5)  Financial hardship exemptions. (a)  These regulations set forth a minimum standard of architectural compatibility with the rest of the district. However, in order to balance with other equally important objectives in the district, including economic development, neighborhood revitalization, and prevention of displacement of residents, the commission may allow reasonable exemptions from these regulations on the ground of economic hardship to the property owner. (b)  In order to qualify for a financial hardship exemption, the applicant(s) must first make a showing that the alteration(s) requested is necessary in order to continue utilizing the structure for its intended purposes. (c)  The burden of proof that the regulations pose such a hardship shall be on the property owner. If the commission finds that the requirement of subsection (5) herein is satisfied, they may grant an exemption, in whole or in part, only in accordance with the following factors, standards and criteria: i.  The present and future income of the property owner(s) and those occupying the property; ii.  The availability, at present or in the future, of other sources of income or revenue, including loans, grants, and tax abatements; iii.  The costs associated with adherence to the district regulations; iv.  The degree of existing architectural importance and integrity of the structure; and v.  The purpose and intent of this chapter. The commission shall balance these factors as applied to the applicant for said exemption and shall grant said exemption, in whole or in part, as appropriate to the case upon a finding that the financial hardship to the applicant is significant and substantially outweighs the need for strict adherence to these regulations. (6)  Subdivision and consolidation. The platting pattern of the district is an integral part of the historic character of the district. No subdivision or consolidation shall be approved unless it can be shown that the proposed subdivision or consolidation is substantially consistent with the historic character or platting pattern of the district. In addition to the requirements of the subdivision and zoning ordinances, including but not limited to sections 15-08.002(a)(2) and 15-08.005(d)(6), all subdivisions or consolidations of lots shall conform to the historic platting pattern in the district with regard to lot size, dimensions, and configurations. The compatibility rule shall apply, and no subdivision or consolidation shall be approved unless and until the commission has made a finding that it is consistent with this provision or with the historic platting pattern of the district and that the resulting lots are so laid out that buildings that are compatible in design, proportion, scale, and general character of the block face, may be reasonably situated and constructed upon such lots. (Ord. No. 2013-16(13-O-0330), § 3(Attach. C), 5-7-13)

Sec. 16-20R.004. - General regulations.     The following general regulations shall apply to all properties within the Means Street Landmark District, except where otherwise stated. 1.  General criteria. The commission shall apply the standards set forth below only when the standards set forth elsewhere in chapter 20R do not specifically address the application in whole or in part: a.  A property shall be used for its current purpose or be placed in a new use authorized in section 16-20R.005 using minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment. b.  The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided. c.  Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken. d.  Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. e.  Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved. f.  Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence. g.  Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. h.  Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken. i.  New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment. j.  New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 2.  The compatibility rule. a.  The intent of these regulations is to ensure that alterations to existing structures and new construction are compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features in the district. To further that intent and simultaneously retain flexibility, the regulations provide a "compatibility rule" which is: The elements in question that are not quantifiable shall be the same as contributing buildings in the district or shall be compatible with, but differentiated from the contributing buildings in the district. Where quantifiable, the element shall be no smaller than the smallest or larger than the largest such dimension of a contributing building on the block face. b.  Those elements to which the compatibility rule applies are specified in these regulations by reference to "compatibility rule." c.  Whenever individual block faces are void of contributing structures, the contributing structures on the nearest block face within the district shall be utilized. 3.  Certificates of Appropriateness. a.  General provisions. i.  The procedures for determining the correct type of Certificate of Appropriateness shall be those specified in Section 16-20.008, except as otherwise provided herein. ii.  No Certificate of Appropriateness shall be required unless, at a minimum, the work would otherwise require a building permit. iii.  No Certificate of Appropriateness shall be required to repaint any structure or portion thereof, or, to make ordinary repairs and maintenance using in-kind materials. A Certificate of Appropriateness shall be required for replacements as indicated in subsection 16-20R.004(3)(b) below. iv.  No Certificate of Appropriateness shall be required for demolition or moving of non-contributing structures. v.  Type I Certificates of Appropriateness shall not be required in this district. b.  Type II Certificates of Appropriateness. i.  The following shall require a Type II Certificate of Appropriateness, and shall be reviewed by the director of the commission: (1.)  Alterations to any façade of any principal structure; (2.)  All site work, including changes in streetscape elements; (3.)  New accessory structures and alterations to existing accessory structures; (4.)  Fences, walls and retaining walls; (5.)  Decks, rear porches, balconies, outdoor seating on the ground level and installation of mechanical equipment; and (6.)  Signage. ii.  If such Type II Certificates of Appropriateness meet the requirements of this chapter and other criteria applicable to Type II certificates, the director shall issue the Type II certificate within 14 days of receipt of the completed application. If such Type II Certificates of Appropriateness do not meet the requirements of this chapter and such other criteria, the director shall deny the application, with notice to the applicant, within 14 days of receipt of the completed application. Appeals from the decision of the director either approving or denying such Type II certificates may be taken by any aggrieved person by filing an appeal in the manner prescribed in the appeals section of subsection 16-20.008(a) for Type I certificates. c.  The following shall require a Type III Certificates of Appropriateness and shall be reviewed by the commission: i.  All new principal structures; ii.  Additions, including roof top additions, roof top decks and roof top outdoor seating; iii.  Increase in height or building footprint revisions to previously approved plans that are yet to be completed; and d.  Variances and special exceptions e.  Type IV Certificates of Appropriateness shall be required for the demolition or moving of any contributing building. Type IV Certificates of Appropriateness shall be reviewed by the commission. i.  A partial demolition of a contributing building shall require a Type IV Certificate of Appropriateness only when, in the determination of the director, said partial demolition will result in the loss of significant architectural features that destroys the building's historic or cultural interpretability or importance. 4.  Contributing Buildings List. a.  All contributing buildings, structures or sites within the district shall be shown on the list adopted herewith entitled "Means Street Landmark District Contributing Buildings List". Said contributing buildings list shall identify each building, structure or site within the district that meets the definition of "Contributing Building, Structure or Site" set forth in Section 16-20.002. b.  The director shall periodically review said contributing buildings list to correct errors or omissions to said contributing buildings list, or to reflect any changed conditions relevant to the contributing status of buildings, structures or sites within the district, consistent with the requirements of chapter 20R and chapter 20 of Part 16, and shall maintain public records of said List and all such errors, omissions or updates. An action by the director to correct such errors or omissions, or to make updates, shall be initiated by execution of a signed and dated form promulgated by the director specifying the action initiated, the reason(s) for such action, and the identification of all property subject to said action. Said form shall be mailed by first class mail to the owner or owners of the effected property within 5 calendar days of the initiation of the action by the director. c.  An action by the director to correct errors or omissions, or to update, the contributing buildings list as authorized in subsection 16-20R.004(4)(b) above shall result in the immediate prohibition of any new or amended applications of any kind effecting such property, including but not limited to demolition requests, building permits or land disturbance permits, and including acceptance of any such application or request by any City of Atlanta bureau, agency, official, employee or agent. Said prohibitions shall become automatically effective without further action of any kind immediately upon the date and time that the director takes an action authorized in subsection 16-20R.004(4)(b) above. The purpose and intent of this provision is to maintain the status quo regarding any such affected property until the director's action is reviewed and affirmed or reversed by the commission in the manner specified in subsection 16-20R.004(4)(d) below. The period of this mandatory interim protection shall be 90 days or until a final decision reviewing such action is made by the commission, whichever first occurs, commencing on the date and time of the director's decision. This interim control period allows and is based upon approximately 30 days for the initial scheduling of the public hearing following the director's action and approximately 60 days for completion of the public hearing and a final decision by the commission. d.  All actions by the director to correct errors or omissions, or to update, said list shall be reviewed and approved by the commission using the notice and procedures required for Type III Certificates of Appropriateness with the following modifications: i.  Hearings on such review and approval by the commission shall be scheduled by the director within thirty (30) days of the director's action on such correction(s) or update(s) and shall be decided by the commission within a reasonable time; and ii.  The commission shall affirm the action(s) of the director upon an expressed finding by the commission that the director's action(s) correctly applied the definitions and requirements for determining the contributing status of the properties in question in chapter 20R and chapter 20 of Part 16. In exercising its review, the commission may reverse or affirm the action(s) of the director, wholly or partly. Appeals from a final decision by the commission on such reviews shall be taken by any person aggrieved by such decision pursuant to Code Section 16-20.010. 5.  Financial Hardship Exemptions. a.  These regulations set forth a minimum standard of architectural compatibility with the rest of the district. However, in order to balance with other equally important objectives in the district, including economic development, neighborhood revitalization, and prevention of displacement of residents, the commission may allow reasonable exemptions from these regulations on the ground of economic hardship to the property owner. This exemption shall not apply to the review of demolitions of contributing structures that would otherwise require a Type IV Certificates of Appropriateness. b.  In order to qualify for an economic hardship exemption, the applicant(s) must first make a showing that the alteration(s) requested is necessary in order to continue utilizing the structure for its intended purposes. c.  If the commission finds that the requirement of subsection (5)(b) herein is satisfied, they may grant an exemption, in whole or in part, only in accordance with each of the following factors, standards and criteria: i.  The burden of proof that the regulations and guidelines pose such a hardship shall be on the property owner. ii.  The commission shall consider the following factors in determining whether an economic hardship exemption in whole or in part will be granted: (1)  The present and future income of the property owner(s) and those occupying the property; (2)  The availability, at present or in the future, or other sources of income of revenue, including loans, grants, and tax abatements; (3)  The costs associated with adherence to the district regulations in comparison to the costs associated with achieving the same proposal without the district regulations; (4)  The degree of existing architectural importance and integrity of the structure; and (5)  The purpose and intent of this chapter. iii.  The commission shall balance these factors as applied to the applicant for said exemption and shall grant said exemption, in whole or in part, as appropriate to the case upon a finding that the economic hardship to the applicant is significant and substantially outweighs the need for strict adherence to these regulations. Appeals from a final decision by the commission on such reviews shall be taken by any person aggrieved by such decision pursuant to Code Section 16-20.010. 6.  Variances and special exceptions. Variance applications and applications for special exceptions from these regulations shall be heard by the commission. The commission shall have the authority to grant or deny variances from the provisions of this chapter pursuant to the procedures, standards, and criteria specified in section 16-26.001 through section 16-26.006.

To further that intent and simultaneously retain flexibility, the regulations provide a "compatibility rule" as follows: i.  The elements in question that are not quantifiable shall be compatible with the contributing buildings on which it is located. ii.  Where quantifiable, the element shall be no smaller than the smallest or larger than the largest such dimension of the contributing building on which it is located. b.  Those elements to which the compatibility rule applies are specified in these regulations by reference to "compatibility rule." 3.  Certificates of Appropriateness. a.  General Provisions. i.  The procedures for determining the correct type of Certificate of Appropriateness shall be those specified in Section 16-20.008, except as otherwise provided herein. ii.  No Certificate of Appropriateness shall be required unless, at a minimum, the work would otherwise require a building permit. iii.  No Certificate of Appropriateness shall be required to make ordinary repairs and maintenance using in-kind materials. iv.  No Certificate of Appropriateness shall be required for interior work. v.  No Type I Certificates of Appropriateness shall be required in this district. b.  Type II Certificates of Appropriateness. i.  Type II Certificates reviewed by the Director.

Appeals from the decision of the Director either approving or denying such Type II Certificates may be taken by any aggrieved person by filing an appeal in the manner prescribed in the appeals Section of Chapter 16-20.008(a) for Type I Certificates. c.  Type III Certificates of Appropriateness. The following Type III Certificates of Appropriateness shall be reviewed by the Commission and shall be required for: i.  Additions; ii.  New construction (excluding interiors of the existing buildings); iii.  Building footprint revisions to previously approved plans that are yet to be constructed; iv.  Variances, special exceptions and administrative appeals. d.  Type IV Certificates of Appropriateness. i.  Type IV Certificates of Appropriateness shall be reviewed by the Commission and shall be required for the demolition or moving of any contributing structure. ii.  A partial demolition of a contributing structure shall require a Type IV Certificate of Appropriateness only when said partial demolition will result in the loss of significant architectural features that destroys the structure's historic or cultural interpretability or importance. 4.  Contributing Buildings/Structures. a.  The 1027 Ponce de Leon Avenue building, the 1061 Ponce de Leon Avenue building, and the open, undeveloped space between 1061 Ponce de Leon Avenue building and Ponce de Leon Avenue. 5.  Financial Hardship Exemptions. a.  These regulations set forth a minimum standard of architectural compatibility with the rest of the district. However, in order to balance with other equally important objectives in the district, including economic development, neighborhood revitalization, and prevention of displacement of residents, the Commission may allow reasonable exemptions from these regulations on the ground of economic hardship to the property owner. b.  In order to qualify for an economic hardship exemption, the applicant(s) must first make a showing that the alteration(s) requested is necessary in order to continue utilizing the structure for its intended purposes. c.  If the Commission finds that the requirement of subsection (5)(b) herein is satisfied, they may grant an exemption, in whole or in part, only in accordance with each of the following factors, standards and criteria: i.  The burden of proof that the regulations and guidelines pose such a hardship shall be on the property owner. ii.  The Commission shall consider the following factors in determining whether an economic hardship exemption in whole or in part will be granted: (1)  The present and future income of the property owner(s) and those occupying the property; (2)  The availability, at present or in the future, or other sources of income of revenue, including loans, grants, and tax abatements; (3)  The costs associated with adherence to the district regulations in comparison to the costs associated with achieving the same proposal without the district regulations; (4)  The degree of existing architectural importance and integrity of the structure; and (5)  The purpose and intent of this chapter. iii.  The Commission shall balance these factors as applied to the applicant for said exemption and shall grant said exemption, in whole or in part, as appropriate to the case upon a finding that the economic hardship to the applicant is significant and substantially outweighs the need for strict adherence to these regulations. Appeals from a final decision by the Commission on such reviews shall be taken by any person aggrieved by such decision pursuant to Code Sec. 16-20.010. 6.  Variances, Special Exceptions and Administrative Appeals. a.  Variance applications and applications for special exceptions and administrative appeals from these regulations shall be heard by the Commission.

To further that intent and simultaneously retain flexibility, the regulations provide a "compatibility rule" as follows: i.  The elements in question that are not quantifiable shall be the same as contributing buildings in the district or shall be compatible with, but differentiated from the contributing buildings in the district. ii.  Where quantifiable, the element shall be no smaller than the smallest or larger than the largest such dimension of the contributing building on which it is located. b.  Those elements to which the compatibility rule applies are specified in these regulations by reference to "compatibility rule." 3.  Variances, special exceptions and administrative appeals. Variance applications and applications for special exceptions and administrative appeals from these regulations shall be heard by the Commission. The Commission shall have the authority to grant or deny variances from the provisions of this chapter pursuant to the procedures, standards, and criteria specified in section 16-26.001 through Section 16-26.006.

The following shall require a Type II Certificate of Appropriateness, and shall be reviewed by the director of the Commission: 1.  Exterior alterations to any façade of any principal structure; 2.  All site work, including dumpster enclosures; and 3.  Signage. If such Type II Certificates of Appropriateness meet the requirements of this Chapter and other criteria applicable to Type II Certificates the Director shall issue the Type II Certificate within 14 days of receipt of the completed application. If such Type II Certificates of Appropriateness do not meet the requirements of this Chapter and such other criteria, the Director shall deny the application, with notice to the applicant, within 14 days of receipt of the completed application. Appeals from the decision of the Director either approving or denying such Type II Certificates may be taken by any aggrieved person by filing an appeal in the manner prescribed in the appeals Section of Chapter 16-20.008(a) for Type I Certificates. c.  Type III Certificates of Appropriateness. The following Type III Certificates of Appropriateness shall be reviewed by the Commission and shall be required for: i.  Additions; ii.  New construction (excluding interiors of the existing buildings); iii.  Building footprint revisions to previously approved plans that are yet to be constructed; and iv.  Variances, special exceptions and administrative appeals. d.  Type IV Certificates of Appropriateness. i.  Type IV Certificates of Appropriateness shall be reviewed by the Commission and shall be required for the demolition or moving of any contributing structure. ii.  A partial demolition of a contributing structure shall require a Type IV Certificate of Appropriateness only when said partial demolition will result in the loss of significant architectural features that destroys the structure's historic or cultural interpretability or importance. 5.  Contributing Buildings/Structures. All brick and masonry buildings and structures constructed within the period of significance (1904-1927) shall be considered contributing to the District, including the brick and masonry portions of buildings to which metal buildings and/or sheds have been attached. In addition, the lateral transfer table structure and components thereof shall also be contributing to the District. 6.  Financial Hardship Exemptions. a.  These regulations set forth a minimum standard of architectural compatibility with the rest of the district. However, in order to balance with other equally important objectives in the district, including economic development, neighborhood revitalization, and prevention of displacement of residents, the Commission may allow reasonable exemptions from these regulations on the ground of economic hardship to the property owner. b.  In order to qualify for an economic hardship exemption, the applicant(s) must first make a showing that the alteration(s) requested is necessary in order to continue utilizing the structure for its intended purposes. c.  If the Commission finds that the requirement of subsection (6)(b) herein is satisfied, they may grant an exemption, in whole or in part, only in accordance with each of the following factors, standards and criteria: i.  The burden of proof that the regulations and guidelines pose such a hardship shall be on the property owner. ii.  The Commission shall consider the following factors in determining whether an economic hardship exemption in whole or in part will be granted: 1.  The present and future income of the property owner(s) and those occupying the property; 2.  The availability, at present or in the future, or other sources of income of revenue, including loans, grants, and tax abatements; 3.  The costs associated with adherence to the district regulations in comparison to the costs associated with achieving the same proposal without the district regulations; 4.  The degree of existing architectural importance and integrity of the structure; and 5.  The purpose and intent of this chapter. iii.  The Commission shall balance these factors as applied to the applicant for said exemption and shall grant said exemption, in whole or in part, as appropriate to the case upon a finding that the economic hardship to the applicant is significant and substantially outweighs the need for strict adherence to these regulations. Appeals from a final decision by the Commission on such reviews shall be taken by any person aggrieved by such decision pursuant to Code Section 16-20.010. ( Ord. No. 2017-77(17-O-1668), 3(Att.

Sec. 16-23.003. - Preliminary determinations by director, bureau of planning.     With MARTA Corridors, applications for building permits shall be referred to the planning director, who shall make a preliminary determination as to whether the action proposed is of a character or magnitude requiring review by the Atlanta Regional Commission, as affecting the area plan. (1)  Applications not requiring referral to Atlanta Regional Commission: Where applications are found not to be for actions of character or magnitude or regional significance, affecting the area plan, and are in accord with development guides relating to the MARTA Corridor, the director, bureau of planning shall certify that referral is not required; and the permit shall be issued if otherwise lawful. (2)  Applications requiring referral to Atlanta Regional Commission: Where applications are found by the director, bureau of planning to be for actions of character or magnitude of regional significance, affecting the area plan, the planning director shall make a preliminary determination as to whether the proposal is in accord with and would support, or is in conflict with and would adversely affect, the area plan and relevant development guides of the Atlanta Regional Commission, with particulars in either case, and shall transmit his preliminary determinations to the commission for their recommendations.     Upon receipt of such recommendations, or at the end of 60 days after date of submission of the preliminary determination, the director, bureau of planning shall proceed to make his final determination, giving due consideration to the recommendations of the commission. Where no recommendations have been received from the commission within 60 days, the director, bureau of planning shall proceed as though the commission had concurred in his preliminary determination. (Code 1977, § 16-23.003) 
Sec. 16-23.004. - Final determinations by planning director.     Final determinations by the director, bureau of planning may be made on the action as originally proposed or as modified, and may confirm, modify or reverse his preliminary determination. Such determination shall consist of approval of the application, approval conditioned on specified modifications, or disapproval. (Code 1977, § 16-23.004) 
Sec. 16-23.005. - Effect of final determination by director, bureau of planning.     On final approval of the application, the director, bureau of planning shall certify such approval; and the building permit shall be issued, if otherwise lawful.

Sec. 16-23.007. - Summary of provisions of Metropolitan River Protection Act affecting local zoning.     The Metropolitan River Protection Act (MRPA), Georgia Laws 1973, Act No. 66, establishes requirements and procedures supplementary to those set forth generally or for specific districts in this part as follows: MRPA Section Subject Matter 5(b)(1) Matters subject to control and manner of control, generally. 5(b)(2) Material to be provided by applicants seeking certificates of compliance with area plans. 5(b)(3) Requirements for conformity of actions with certificate, and for new certificates for substantial change of land or water use. 5(c) Requirement for hearings by local governing authority before determination on issuance or denial of certificates. 6(a) Requirement that within ten days after issuance of certificate, the governing authority shall transmit a copy of its findings thereon and all supporting information filed by applicant, with the Atlanta Regional Commission. 6(b) Requirement that no certificate shall become effective until 60 days after submission to the commission, which may recommend modification, for cause, within such period. If the commission fails to recommend modification within such period, the certificate shall become effective as issued. 6(c) Provides that where the commission has recommended modification, the governing authority may adopt such modification as a condition of the certificate, override the recommendation by majority vote of a full membership of the governing body, or request reconsideration by the commission at a public hearing. If the governing authority fails to take one of these actions within 45 days of the submission of the recommendations of the commission to it, the certificate shall not become effective. 7 To simplify procedures, the commission may itself issue a certificate permitting a land or water use where the applicant and the local government have consented to such certificate, if the use permitted is in compliance with the plan and the purpose of the Act, following public notice and hearings as specified. 8 Except as exempted at Section 12 or 15, MARTA, certificates or recommendations shall comply with the following limitations. (a) No land or water use shall be permitted in the floodplain; and (b) No land or water use shall be permitted within 150 horizontal feet of the watercourse unless the proposed use is not harmful to the water and land resources of the stream corridor, will not significantly impede the natural flow of floodwaters, and will not result in significant land erosion, stream bank erosion, siltation or water pollution. 9 Providing for appeals from final determination of the commission of governing authority to superior court of the county, in the manner provided for appeals from boards of zoning appeals in Code, Chapter 69-12. 10 Provides that requirements of the Act are in addition to and do not supersede other requirements of law, including zoning and building regulations of the local government. 12 Exempts the following uses from application of the Act: (a) No land or water use for agricultural or animal husbandry; (b) Ordinary maintenance and landscaping operations; (c) Land or water uses under specified circumstances and limitations during a 36-month transitional period after the effective date of the Act. 13 Provides for enforcement and penalties of a nature additional to or differing from those which might be applicable under this part. 15 Exempts removal of sand from the watercourses from the application of the Act when such removal returns no greater effluent than that removed, and when no erosion occurs along the banks of the watercourse.  (Code 1977, § 16-23.007) _____
Sec. 16-23.008. - Application of MRPA provisions in full.     To the extent that the provisions set forth in abbreviated form above, or other MRPA provisions, supplement or alter procedures or requirements on use of land or construction and use of buildings in the Chattahoochee, such sections or subsections shall apply as though set forth in full herein. (Code 1977, § 16-23.008) 
CHAPTER 24. - NONCONFORMITIES 
Sec. 16-24.001. - Intent.     Within the districts established by this part or amendments that may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures, uses of land and structures, and characteristics of use which were lawful before the ordinance was passed or amended but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this part or future amendment. (1)  It is the intent of this chapter to require removal or cessation of certain of these nonconformities, and to permit others to continue until they are otherwise removed or ceased. It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconformities shall not be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district, nor enlarged upon, extended or expanded except as herein provided. (2)  Nonconforming uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. Nonconforming use of land, structures, or land and structures in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this chapter by attachment on a building or premises of signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by addition of other uses, of a nature generally prohibited in the district involved. (3)  To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, and upon which actual building construction has been carried on diligently. "Actual construction" is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction provided that work shall be carried on diligently. (Code 1977, § 16-24.001) 
Sec. 16-24.002. - Nonconforming lots of record. (1)  Where lots of record at the time of passage or amendment of this chapter are below the minimum dimensions established by such regulations, regulations and requirements applying thereto shall be as provided below. In cases where land is taken for public purposes from legal lots of record at the time of such taking, the lots remaining shall also be construed as nonconforming. (2)  Single Lots of Record: In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory building may be built on any single lot of record at the effect date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of these regulations. Variance of yard requirements in such cases shall be obtained only through variance action of the board of zoning adjustment. (Code 1977, § 16-24.002) 
Sec. 16-24.003. - Nonconforming uses of land (or land with minor structures only).     Where at the time of passage of this chapter or amendment thereto lawful use of land exists which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this part and where such use involves no permanent individual structure with a fixed foundation and with a replacement cost exceeding $5000, the use may be continued for a period of not more than two (2) years after the effective date, of this chapter or amendment thereto creating nonconforming status so long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided: (1)  No such nonconforming use of land or land with minor structures shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter. (2)  No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part into any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter. (3)  If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than 30 days, any subsequent use of land shall conform to the regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which such land is located. (4)  No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this chapter shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land. (5)  At the end of the above-prescribed two-year period, the nonconforming use of land shall cease and the nonconforming use of any minor structures as defined above shall cease, and the land or land and minor structures in combination shall thereafter be used for purposes permitted in the district in which they are located. (Code 1977, § 16-24.003) 
Sec. 16-24.004. - Nonconforming structures.     Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter that could not be built under the terms of this chapter by reasons of restriction on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it is and remains otherwise lawful subject to the following provisions: (1)  No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity; but any structure or portion thereof may be enlarged or altered if the degree of its nonconformity remains the same or is decreased, provided such structure is used for a permitted use. (2)  (a) One- and two-family residential structures: Should such nonconforming one- or two-family residential structure or nonconforming portion of structure be destroyed, by any means, in whole or in part, it may be reconstructed in the same location and upon its previous foundation and to its previously existing height, provided said reconstruction does not increase the previously existing degree of nonconformity and further provided that said reconstructed structure is used for a permitted use. (b)  All other structures: Should such nonconforming multi-family residential, commercial or industrial structure or nonconforming portion of structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 60 percent of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. (c)  Accessory structures: When nonconforming, shall be subject to the same provisions as govern the primary structure to which they are an accessory. (3)  Moving: A nonconforming structure may be moved on its own lot only if the administrative official determines that such movement reduces the degree of nonconformity to the maximum extent reasonably feasible, or eliminates such nonconformity, but shall in no case be moved on its own lot in such a manner as to increase the degree of nonconformity.     Where a nonconforming structure is moved off its previous lot, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved.     Nothing contained herein shall prevent the strengthening or restoring to safe condition of any structure or part thereof declared unsafe by any public official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official. (4)  [Reducing of yards:] In cases where land is taken for public purposes from legal lots of record at the time of such taking in such manner as to reduce yards previously provided in relation to a portion of a structure below yard requirements generally applicable within the district, the portion of the structure involved shall be construed to be nonconforming. (5)  Removal of abandoned antennas: Any antenna that is not operated for a continuous period of one year shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna shall remove same within 90 days of receipt of notice from the bureau of buildings about such abandonment. If such antenna is not removed within said 90 days, the city may, in the manner provided in sections 41-2-8 through 41-2-17 of the Official Code of Georgia, remove such antenna at the owner's expense. If there are two or more users of a single antenna, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the antenna. (6)  Limited nonconforming side yard expansions allowed: (a)  In the R-4, R-4A, R-4B and R-5 zoning districts, vertical additions and renovations to existing single-family structures and accessory structures with non-conforming side yard setbacks are authorized within such nonconforming side yards provided: (i)  Such additions and renovations shall not exceed the existing degree of horizontal setback nonconformity along the length of the nonconforming structure; and (ii)  Such additions and renovations within the nonconforming area shall not exceed the maximum building height allowed in the applicable zoning district minus the distance of the existing side yard nonconformity. For example, if an existing single-family structure encroaches into the required side yard setback by four feet, any vertical addition or renovation will be limited to a maximum height of 31 feet, which is the allowed maximum height (35 feet) minus the existing nonconformity (four feet). (iii)  This provision shall be applied only to additions and renovations to existing nonconforming single-family structures and accessory structures within the referenced zoning districts. New structures shall comply with the side yard setbacks required in the applicable zoning district. (Code 1977, § 16-24.004; Ord. No. 1997-06, § 1, 2-10-97; Ord. No. 2019-09(18-O-1581), § 8.1, 1-31-19 ) 
Sec. 16-24.005. - Nonconforming uses or major structures or of major structures and premises in combination.     If lawful use involving individual structures with a replacement cost of $5000 or more, or of structures and premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this chapter, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: (1)  No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended or moved, except in changing the use of a structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located. (a)  Intent: Although the general intent not to permit expansion of nonconformities set forth in section 16-24.001 is reaffirmed, where indefinite continuation of nonconforming uses in major permanent structures with fixed foundations and with replacement costs exceeding $5000 seems assured, it is hereby found to be adverse to the general public interest to require that such uses remain in mislocated buildings, or to prohibit enclosure of existing outdoor sales, service or storage operations. (b)  Special exception authorized: The board of zoning adjustment may, therefore, by special exception, permit enlargement, extension or moving on the same lot, subject to general requirements and procedures applying to special exceptions and with the following special requirements, limitations and considerations. No such special exception shall be issued on locations and for classes of cases indicated in section 16-24.003. (c)  Materials to be submitted with application: Applications shall be accompanied by site and building plans, photographs of the property and of surrounding property, evidence of continued use, extent of present outdoor sales, service or storage operations, and such other material as may be appropriate in the circumstances of the case. During processing of the application, additional information reasonably necessary to the making of required findings may be called for and shall be provided before decisions are made. (d)  Limitations on extension or expansion: Floor area shall not be increased except to provide for interior sales, service or storage operations replacing existing outdoor sales, storage or service; and outdoor sales, storage or service thus replaced shall not be resumed in the future. In no case shall floor area be increased by more than 35 percent of that existing at the time the use became nonconforming. No floor area increase shall be permitted which is likely to have the effect of intensifying the nonconforming use by increasing traffic, number of customers or employees, or other means. At nonconforming service stations, no floor area increase shall be permitted which would allow total floor area to exceed 2000 square feet. (e)  Screening: Where the lot adjoins or abuts a lot in a residential district directly or with an intervening alley (but not with an intervening street), a solid screening fence or wall not less than six (6) nor more than eight (8) feet in height, or approved vegetative screening, shall be provided and maintained in good condition and appearance; except that such screening shall not be located in required yards adjacent to streets or where it could interfere with visibility at intersections or traffic ways. (f)  Access, parking and service area: Before such special exceptions are granted, the board shall seek the advice of appropriate city agencies or officials concerning adequacy of design, scale, location and improvement of existing access and parking and service areas, and shall require correction of any deficiencies it finds to be of substantial significance as a condition to the granting of the exception. (g)  Signs, lighting of premises: Where such special exceptions are granted, limitations appropriate to the nature of the surrounding area shall be placed on the number, size, character and location of signs and the nature of lighting of signs and premises. Such limitations may require removal, redesign and/or relocation of existing signs and lighting. (h)  Hours and conditions of operation: As a condition to the granting of the special exception, the board may establish such limitations on hours and conditions of operations as it finds reasonably necessary to protect the safety, security, comfort and tranquility of the area, and particularly of nearby residential uses. (i)  Findings required: No such special exception shall be granted except upon findings by the board that the nonconforming use has continued and is likely to continue indefinitely, and that the actions proposed in the application as submitted, and with the conditions and safeguards attached and accepted by the applicant, would result in substantial reduction of existing adverse effects on surrounding property and/or in other substantial public advantage. (2)  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building. (3)  Changes in nonconforming uses of major structures or of major structures and uses in combination shall be permitted as follows: (a)  To any use conforming to the regulations of the district in which located; or (b)  To any use permitted in the most restrictive district in which such original nonconforming use is first permitted by this part, subject to the requirements and regulations concerning such use in the district; provided however, that no nonconforming nonresidential use shall be changed to a residential use in any district in which similar residential uses are not permitted. (4)  Any major structure, or major structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the districting in which it located; and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed. (5)  When a nonconforming use of a major structure or major structure and premises in combination is discontinued for a continuous period of one (1) year, the structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. Such restriction shall not apply if such cessation is as a direct result of governmental action impeding access to the premises. (6)  Where nonconforming use status applies to a major structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. "Destruction," for the purpose of this subsection, is defined as damage to an extent of more than 60 percent of the replacement cost at the time of destruction. (a)  Where damage is to an extent 60 percent or less of replacement cost, such structures may be restored to the same or lesser size in the same location; provided however, that restoration shall begin within 12 months of damage and be diligently carried to completion; and nonconforming use may be resumed and continued as before, or on a lesser scale, but shall not be enlarged or intensified. Unless restoration is so initiated and completed, the use shall terminate and not be resumed. Remodeling shall not be deemed removal or destruction. Destruction made necessary by repairs, maintenance and/or remodeling shall not be construed to be removal or destruction. (b)  Special exception for replacement or reconstruction of destroyed major structures containing nonconforming uses: Where a major structure containing a nonconforming use is destroyed to an extent of more than 60 percent of replacement cost at time of destruction, the board of zoning adjustment may, by special exception, permit its replacement or reconstruction in whole or in part upon making all of the following findings: (i)  That the cause of destruction was not the deliberate action of the owner or occupant of the structure or their agents; and (ii)  That nothing contained in the provisions of section 16-24.003 required termination of such nonconforming use; and (iii)  That the board finds substantial public advantage in continuance of the nonconforming use; and (iv)  That the primary purpose of continuing the nonconforming use is not to continue a monopoly; and (v)  That replacement or reconstruction in the manner proposed, with related actions imposed in conditions and safeguards by the board, would reduce any previous adverse effects of the use on neighboring properties. (7)  Special exception for the expansion of nonconforming residential uses in the r-4 and r-5 residential districts. (a)  The board of zoning adjustment may, by special exception, permit the enlargement, extension or moving on the same lot of a structure containing a nonconforming multi-family use in an R-4 or R-5 residential district or the enlargement, extension or moving on the same lot of a structure containing a nonconforming two-family use in an R-4 residential district, upon making all of the findings set forth in this subsection (7)(a), (i) through (v) below, each of which shall specifically be made a part of the record of such special exception proceedings. With respect to each such required finding, the burden of proof shall be on the person asserting an entitlement to the nonconforming use to show, by clear and convincing evidence, his or her entitlement to a nonconforming use, the continuous maintenance of such use, and the substantial likelihood that such use will continue indefinitely. In order to grant any such special exception, the board must find that: (i)  The total number of residential units and bedrooms on the subject property remains the same or is decreased; and (ii)  Any proposed floor area increase shall not intensify the nonconforming use by increasing traffic, use of on-street or off-street parking, number of residents or by other means; and (iii)  The height and scale of the buildings resulting from the proposed expansion is in character with adjoining buildings in the neighborhood; and (iv)  The total coverage of the lot resulting from the proposed expansion is consistent with the character of other homes in the neighborhood; and (v)  The nonconforming use has continued and is likely to continue indefinitely, and the actions proposed in the application as submitted, and with the conditions and safeguards attached and accepted by the applicant, would not adversely affect surrounding properties. (b)  Before any such special exception is granted and in addition to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this subsection (7), the board shall seek the advice of appropriate city agencies or officials concerning the adequacy of design, scale, location and improvement of existing access and parking and shall require correction of any deficiencies it finds to be of significance as a condition to the granting of any such special exception. (c)  Where the enlargement, extension or movement on the lot would otherwise require the granting of a variance application, nothing in the provisions of paragraph (a) of this subsection (7) shall be construed as relieving the special exception applicant from the necessity of also obtaining the requisite variance or variances otherwise necessary. (d)  Any nonconforming multi-family residential structure in an R-4 or R-5 district, including any nonconforming duplex in an R-4 residential district or structure and land in combination in an R-4 or R-5 residential district in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed. (e)  When the use of any portion of a nonconforming multi-family residential structure in an R-4 or R-5 district or a nonconforming duplex in an R-4 district is discontinued for a continuous period of 12 months, the structure, or structure and premises in combination shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. (f)  That the provisions of this section 16-24.005 be and shall be deemed to apply with full force and effect to any nonconforming multi-family residential structure in an R-4 or R-5 district, including any nonconforming duplex in an R-4 residential district or structure and land in combination in an R-4 or R-5 residential district. (g)  In connection with any request for a special exception filed pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, the applicant shall identify and file as an exhibit to said application for special exception any and all special exception applications, variance applications, and building permits previously sought by or on behalf of the applicant or a person controlled by the applicant with respect to the subject property, whether or not such application(s) or permit(s) have been approved or granted. (8)  Provisions for certain existing multifamily uses and buildings in R-3 through R-5, RG, and MR districts. (a)  The purpose and intent of the following provisions is to allow for the continued existence of certain nonconforming multifamily uses and buildings in combination, whether or not such buildings are currently in use or have been discontinued for a continuous period of one year or more, in order to encourage diverse housing options that have existed for some period of time as well as to provide a range of housing opportunities. Due to their importance to the public health and welfare, these provisions shall apply notwithstanding other contrary provisions elsewhere in chapter 24. (b)  The provisions of this section shall apply only to existing nonconforming multifamily uses and buildings in combination that meet each of the following criteria: (i)  Contain no less than four and no more than 12 dwelling units; (ii)  Have not been renovated and used in compliance with the existing zoning district's density or maximum dwelling unit requirements as regulated by section 16-24.005(4) above; (iii)  Were constructed and used for multifamily uses prior to 1946; (iv)  Are located in the R-3 through R-5, RG, or MR zoning districts; and (v)  Contain no non-residential uses. (c)  Each of the following provisions shall apply to existing nonconforming multifamily uses and buildings in combination that meet all of the qualifications in subsection 16-24.005(8)(b) above: (i)  The one-year non-use requirements of section 16-24.005(5) shall not apply; (ii)  Required on-site parking shall be equal to or less than the number of spaces originally provided for the building; (iii)  Renovation of the building shall be authorized provided there is no increase in total existing: square footage; FAR; building footprint; exterior wall locations; height; or total number of units; (iv)  Buildings that are unintentionally damaged by acts of nature, accidental fire, flooding, and similar events, in an amount that is 60 percent or less of the building's replacement cost, may be renovated provided there is no increase in the total square footage, FAR, building footprint, exterior wall locations, height or total number of units that existed immediately prior to such damage; and (v)  Buildings that are intentionally damaged or destroyed, and buildings that are unintentionally damaged or destroyed in an amount that is more than 60 percent of the building's replacement cost, shall lose their nonconforming status, provided that this subsection (c)(v) shall not apply to renovations authorized in subsection (c)(iii) above. (Code 1977, § 16-24.005; Ord. No. 2019-09(18-O-1581), § 6.H, 1-31-19 ) 
Sec. 16-24.006. - Nonconforming characteristics of use. (a)  If accessory characteristics of use, such as off-street parking and loading, lighting, or other matters pertaining to the use of land, structures or premises are made nonconforming by this chapter as passed or amended, no change shall be made which increases the degree of nonconformity with the requirements of this chapter; but changes may be made which result in the same or a lesser degree of nonconformity. In cases where land is taken for public purposes in such a manner as to reduce off-street parking or loading space below that previously existing and required by the regulations for the district, the deficiency thus created shall be construed as a nonconforming characteristic of use. (b)  The parking requirements for a business that is to be operated with a license for the consumption of malt beverages, wine and/or distilled spirits, shall not be based on the continuation of non-conforming off-street parking arrangements for any eating and drinking establishment that has previously operated at that location unless there has been a valid license for on-premises consumption of the same type as that under consideration, in operation at that location within the previous 12 months. (Code 1977, § 16-24.006; Ord. No. 2005-41(06-O-0381), § 1, 7-12-05) 
Sec. 16-24.007. - Uses permissible by special use permit or special exception not to be construed as nonconforming uses.     Except as otherwise provided herein, any use which is permissible by special use permit or special exception in a district shall not be considered a nonconforming use in the district if in lawful existence prior to passage of the requirement for such special permit or special exception, but shall without further action be considered a conforming use. So long as such use remains the same, structural alterations within the general limits of the regulations of this chapter shall be permitted on the premises of such use; but any enlargement, extension, movement or replacement of such use, with respect to land or structures, shall require a special exception or special use permit, as appropriate to the case, as though it were a new use. (Code 1977, § 16-24.007) 
Sec. 16-24.008. - Measurement of floor area for additions to residential structures.     The measurement of floor area to determine whether an addition or renovation to a residential structure exceeds the floor area ratio allowed in the R-1 through R-5 districts shall not include the basement and attic space of structures which were constructed or which will be constructed pursuant to a valid building permit properly applied for prior to the effective date of the adoption of this section provided: (1)  The renovation of an existing basement or the addition of any basement space does not (i) expand the footprint of the existing structure; or (ii) expose existing walls that are more than four feet below existing grade for more than 50 percent of the total exterior perimeter walls to be exposed. (2)  The renovation or addition of attic space shall be a design which does not either: (a)  Increase the existing height of the highest point or main ridgeline of the main roof structure of the highest story; or (b)  Provide new dormers that (i) engage the main ridge line of the main roof structure; or (ii) interrupt the primary eave line; or (iii) occupy more than 40 percent of the total surface area of the roof plane on which it is constructed. (Ord. No. 2007-48(07-O-0642), § 5, 8-23-07) 
CHAPTER 25. - SPECIAL PERMITS 
Sec. 16-25.001. - Intent: Classes of special permits.     Three (3) classes of special permits are established for the purpose of this part: (a)  Special use permits, decided by the council after public notice and hearing and recommendation by the zoning review board, are intended to be used in connection with uses of substantial significance or of unusual operational characteristics. (b)  Special administrative permits are intended to be used where complex or unusual technical determinations are involved and/or in conjunction with temporary uses and structures where the matter is not of such a nature as to require public notice and hearing. Such permits shall be processed by the bureau of planning. (c)  Special exceptions, decided by the board of zoning adjustment after public notice and hearing, are intended to be used in conjunction with cases where consideration of effects on the surrounding property is of principal importance. (Code 1977, § 16-25.001) 
Sec. 16-25.002. - Special permits, general.     No building or occupancy permit shall be issued for any structure or use requiring any of the above special permits until such special permit has been obtained, and any such structure or use shall be in full accord with the requirements and limitations set forth in such special permit. No such permits shall be required or issued except in classifications specifically provided for in this part, or other than in accord with the procedures, standards and requirements set forth in connection therewith. (1)  Conditions: In granting special permits, such conditions may be attached as are deemed necessary in the particular case to protect the public interest and surrounding properties. Such conditions shall generally be of a nature as so stated in (3) below, "Construction, generally." (2)  Transfer: A special permit, together with any conditions and safeguards attached, is granted to an individual, firm or corporation. Such permit may be transferred to another individual, firm or corporation only upon approval in the manner hereinafter described: a.  Special use permits: The transfer of a special use permit is authorized upon the approval of the director of the office of zoning and development after a request for such transfer has been filed with the office of zoning and development by the proposed new owner or operator, provided that requests for transfers of special use permits previously conditioned in a manner that prohibited transfer of the permit shall not be authorized. Authorized requests for transfer shall be accompanied by an affidavit certifying that the new operator or owner is thoroughly familiar with and will abide by the terms of the original special use permit including all conditions, as well as all other materials required by an application form promulgated by the director. The director shall notify the chair of the NPU within which the property is located that a request for transfer has been made, which notice shall be sent by electronic mail immediately following acceptance of the transfer application. The director shall approve the request only upon a finding that the new owner or operator meets each of the following criteria: i.  Has the intent and the ability to adhere to all terms and conditions of the special use permit; ii.  Has secured, or will immediately secure upon approval of the request, all federal, state and local licenses, permits and other certifications required to operate the special use permit; and iii.  Does not have a history of code or criminal violations directly pertaining to the special use permit's operational characteristics that would jeopardize the public's health or safety in the operation of that permit. Otherwise, the director shall deny the request.

This standard shall not be varied except through issuance of a variance from the board of zoning adjustment in accordance with the standards specified in section 16-26.003 of the zoning ordinance; provided, however, that a problem related solely to signal transmission or reception standards shall not be sufficient grounds for granting said variance. (ii)  Lattice antennas and antennas requiring guy lines or other cable supports are prohibited. (iii)  Roof antennas. (a)  The following additional regulations, standards, and criteria shall govern all roof antennas. (b)  Special administration permits may be issued in accordance with section 16-25.004 provided such roof antennas are determined by the director of the bureau of planning to meet the requirements set forth in subsections (c) and (d) below. (c)  Roof antennas and related equipment and structures shall not exceed the minimum height necessary to accomplish their intended function, but under no circumstances shall they extend more than ten feet above the height of the supporting structure upon which the roof antenna is attached or affixed. (d)  Roof antennas and related equipment and structures shall be painted in a color scheme identical to or closely compatible with the color of the supporting structure upon which the roof antenna is attached or affixed, and in such a manner as to make the antenna and related equipment and structures as visually unobtrusive as possible. (iv)  Other permissible antennas. (a)  The following additional regulations, standards, and criteria shall govern all antennas except roof antennas, not otherwise prohibited by section 16-25.002(3)(i). (b)  Each applicant for a special use permit or special administrative permit shall provide to the bureau of planning an inventory of its existing towers that are either within the city or within one quarter mile of the city limit, including specific information about the location, height and design of each tower. The bureau of planning may share such information with other applicants applying for special use permits or special administrative permits under this ordinance, or with other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the city, provided, however, that the bureau of planning, by sharing such information, is not in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. (c)  No new antenna tower shall be permitted unless the applicant reasonably demonstrates that such tower is necessary and that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. To demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna, the applicant shall submit evidence that one or more of the following conditions exist: (1)  No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet the applicant's engineering requirements; or (2)  Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements; or (3)  Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment; or (4)  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the operations of the applicant's proposed antenna; or (5)  The fees, costs or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable; or (6)  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors which render existing towers and structures unsuitable. (d)  The height of each such antenna shall be regulated and limited in relation to the following: Proximity to residential structures and residential district boundaries; the surrounding topography; the surrounding tree coverage and foliage; and the design of the antenna, with particular reference to design characteristics which have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness. In no event, however, shall any such antenna exceed the minimum height necessary to accomplish its intended function as certified by a registered engineer licensed by the State of Georgia. Said certification shall be the responsibility of the applicant and shall be submitted to the City of Atlanta Bureau of Planning at the time application for said special use permit is made. Further, under no circumstances shall any such antenna exceed 200 feet in height as measured from existing grade. Equipment and structure related to such antennas shall not exceed the height limitation specified in the zoning district in which the property is located. (e)  Such antennas and related equipment and structures shall be painted in a neutral color identical to or closely compatible with the surroundings, and in such a manner as to make the antenna and related equipment and structures as visually unobtrusive as possible. (f)  Such antennas and related equipment and structures shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six feet in height, and said antennas shall be equipped with an appropriate anticlimbing device. Said fencing shall be buffered and screened as provided by subsection (3)d above. (g)  Such antennas and related equipment that are proposed for any residentially zoned area shall be permitted only upon a showing by the applicant that said antenna and related equipment cannot be located upon nonresidentially zoned property in the same area in such a way as to adequately satisfy its intended purpose. The foregoing requirement of a showing shall include submission of an affidavit identifying all nonresidentially zoned properties which the applicant has considered for the location of the antenna and related equipment.

In its findings in this regard, it may report that the proposal is compatible or incompatible with all such plans, or that while the change is in accord with those of longer range it would be premature in the light of the 1-year or 5-year comprehensive development plans. The bureau shall not recommend any change not in accord with adopted comprehensive development plans but may, where it sees fit, recommend changes in such plans, following which, if such changes in plans are officially adopted, the zoning change may be reconsidered without prejudice and without a new application if an application is involved. (2)  Availability of and effect on public facilities and services; referrals to other agencies: The bureau shall consider and report on the availability of public facilities and services and the effect the proposed change would have on demands for public facilities and services in the area in which the change is proposed or generally.

Sec. 16-28.003. - Determination concerning uses not specified.     Where there is substantial doubt as to whether particular uses or classes of uses not specifically identified in these regulations are of the same general character of those listed as permitted principal or accessory uses or uses permissible by special permit or special exception, upon request from any administrative official of the city or on its own initiative, the bureau of builders, in consultation with the bureau of planning, shall make a determination on the matter, giving due consideration to the intent of this part concerning the district, the character of uses specifically identified and the character of the use in question.     Requests for such determinations shall be made only by officers or agencies of the city and shall not involve cases where the official charged with administration and enforcement of this part has made a negative finding, in which cases appeal shall be made to the board of zoning adjustment on grounds of error in the determination.

Sec. 16-28.007. - Regular lots. (1)  Width of Regular Lots; Measurement: To any lot in any dwelling district, located on a cul-de-sac or curved street, when the side lot lines are projected radially from the street line, the following provision may apply in lieu of the lot frontage required: (a)  On lots requiring 100 feet of frontage or less, the lot frontage will be considered as that distance measured in a straight line, between the side lot lines at a point proposed for the actual location of the façade facing the street of the residential structure; provided, however, that the lot width shall measure at least 35 feet at the street property line and at the narrowest part of the width of the lot. (b)  For lots located in the R-1 district, the frontage required will be considered as that distance, measured in two (2) chords of 100 feet each, measured between the side lot lines at a point proposed for the actual location of the façade facing the street of the residential structure; provided, however, that the lot width shall measure at least 35 feet at the street property line and at the narrowest part of the width of the lot. For lots located in the R-2 district, the frontage required will be considered as that distance measured in two (2) chords of 75 feet each, measured between the side lot lines at a point proposed for the actual location of the façade facing the street of the residential structure; provided, however, that the lot width shall measure at least 35 feet at the street property line and at the narrowest part of the width of the lot. (2)  Area of Regular Lot: (a)  Net area of a regular lot: Net area of a regular lot shall be construed as total area within its boundaries. (b)  Gross area of a regular lot: Gross area of a regular lot, where used for computation of allowable floor area for multi-family or PD-H residential use through application of floor area ratios, shall be computed as the net area of the lot, as described above, plus half of adjoining permanent open space such as streets, parks, lakes, cemeteries and the like, up to a maximum of 50 feet. Where such space adjoins lots on two (2) adjacent sides, the area thus added shall include the area required to complete the gap otherwise left at the intersection, as indicated at a below:     The gross area of lot 1 is thus the area within its boundaries plus the hatched area at the top and side including the rectangle marked a. The gross area of lot 2 is its net area plus the hatched area across its front. (3)  Lot Types, Regular Lots: The diagram below illustrates terminology used herein with reference to regular corners, interior, reversed frontage, and through lots: LOT TYPES—REGULAR LOTS     In the diagram, A = corner lot, defined as a lot located at the intersection of two (2) or more streets. A lot abutting on a curved street or streets shall be considered a corner lot if straight lines drawn from the foremost points of the side lot lines to the foremost point of the lot (projected if rounded) meet at an interior angle of less than 135 degrees (see lots marked A(1) in the diagram).     B = interior lot, defined as a lot other than a corner lot, abutting only one (1) street.     C = through lot, defined as a lot other than a corner lot with frontage on more than one (1) street. Through lots abutting two (2) streets may be referred to as double frontage lots.     D = reversed frontage lot, defined as a lot on which the frontage is at right angles or approximately right angles (interior angle less than 135 degrees) to the general pattern in the area. A reversed frontage lot may also be a corner lot (A-D); an interior lot (B-D), or a through lot (C-D). (4)  Lot Frontage: (a)  On regular interior lots: On regular interior lots, the front shall be construed as the shortest portion nearest the street. (b)  On regular corner lots: On regular corner lots, the front shall be construed as the shortest boundary adjacent to a street. If the lot has equal frontage on two (2) or more streets, frontage shall be construed in accordance with the prevailing building pattern, or the prevailing lotting pattern if a building pattern has not been established. (c)  On reversed frontage corner lots: On reversed frontage corner lots, if the shortest boundary fronting on a street is 80 percent or more of the length of the longest boundary fronting on a street, the applicant may select either frontage for the full-depth required front yard, if lot width requirements for the district are met. (d)  On regular through lots: On regular through lots, all portions adjacent to streets shall be considered in establishing frontage for regulatory purposes. If the administrative official finds that the pattern of lots and/or the pattern of required lots adjacent to portions of the through lot is such as to justify a requirement that more than one frontage be provided on such lot, such additional frontage shall be required. If one of the frontages is determined to be the rear yard of the lot, a five-foot wide buffer with vegetative screen no less than six feet in height shall be required along the rear property line. (5)  Yards, Regular Lots: (a)  Front yards: Front yards shall be construed as extending between side lot lines across the frontage of a lot adjoining a public street. Depth of a front yard shall be measured as indicated in (f) below. (b)  Half-depth front yards adjacent to streets other than in frontage: Where portions of the lot adjoin a street other than in frontage, as described in (a) above, yard parallel to the street and at least half the width of the front yard required in the district shall be provided. Such yard shall be subject to limitations on uses as provided for front yards. Depth of such yards shall be measured as indicated in (f) below. (c)  Average depth front yard: Where more than 50 percent of the frontage within a block between intersecting streets is developed with structures having a lesser setback than required by the applicable district regulations, the setback requirement for proposed structures may be reduced to the average setback so established by the bureau of buildings but shall not be reduced by less than 50 percent of the required setback so contained within the applicable district regulations. (d)  Side yards, credit for adjacent alleys: Side yards shall be construed as running from the rear line of the required front yard to the front line of the required rear yard. Where a side lot line adjoins an alley, half the width of the alley shall be considered as within the lot in determining whether side yard requirements have been met.     Width of side yards shall be measured at right angles to the lot line, so that required minimum yard is a strip of the minimum width required with its inner edge parallel to its outer edge.     On through lots with more than one front yard, the side yard shall be construed as running to the rear lines of the front yard involved. (e)  Rear yards, credit for adjacent alleys: Rear yards shall be construed as extending across the full width of the lot at its rear, except where a portion of such width is within a half depth front yard, in which case the rear yard shall be construed as extending across the width of the lot for the portion not in such required half-depth front yard. Where a rear lot line adjoins an alley, half the width of the alley shall be considered as within the lot in determining whether rear yard requirements have been met. (f)  Special yards: A special yard, for purposes of these regulations, shall be construed as a yard other than adjacent to a street, required to perform the same functions as a side or rear yard but adjacent to a lot line so placed or oriented that neither the term "side yard" nor the term "rear yard," as generally determined, defined or applied with respect to regular lots, fits the circumstances of the case. In such instances, the building official shall require special yard, with minimum dimensions and methods of measurement as generally required for either a side or rear yard in the district, determining which shall apply by the relation of the portion of the lot on which the yard is to be located to the adjoining lot or lots, with due regard to the orientation of structures and buildable areas thereon. (g)  Yards adjacent to the public streets; methods of measurements: Measurements of yards adjacent to public streets to determine conformity with the requirements of this part shall be made as follows: A straight line shall be drawn between the two points at which the lot lines for the portion of the lot involved intersect street right-of-way lines. Where property corners are rounded, such points shall be plotted by projecting the lot lines to the point where they would have met without rounding. Depth of required yards adjacent to public streets shall be measured perpendicular to such straight line, and the inner line of such required yard shall be parallel to the outer line. (h)  Setback lines established by council: Where setback lines have been officially established by the council with required greater distances from property lines to buildable area boundaries than would be required by generally applicable yard requirements, such setback lines shall govern in determining boundaries of buildable areas. (i)  Diagram indicating location and method of measurement of yards on regular lots: The diagram which follows indicates location and method of measurement of yards on regular lots. Location and Method of Measurement of Yards (1) Location and Method of Measurement of Yards (2) (Code 1977, § 16-28.007; Ord. No. 2003-88, § 1, 9-10-03) 
Sec. 16-28.008. - Required yards and open space, detailed limitations on occupancy.     In addition to general limitations on yard or open space occupancy set forth herein, the following limitations and requirements shall apply: (1)  Limitations on projections into required yards and open spaces: Eaves, sills, belt courses, energy generation devices, cornices, ornamental features, chimneys, flues, ducts, pipes, window or similarly affixed air conditioners, bay windows, and the like may project not more than 20 inches into any required yard or open space, except where such projections are prohibited by other lawful regulations. For additional provisions related to the placement of structures within yards see section 16-28.006(7). (2)  Porches and entries in required front yards: Porches and entries, enclosed or unenclosed, may be provided in required front yards, provided that such structures shall not extend more than ten feet into such yards. (3)  Canopies for commercial, service or industrial uses: In connection with commercial, service or industrial uses in districts where permitted, canopies may occupy required yards adjacent to streets, provided that: (a)  No portion of such canopy shall be closer than six feet to any street right-of-way (projected vertically); and (b)  No portion of such canopy shall be closer than 25 feet to any lot line intersecting the street right-of-way line; and (c)  No portion of such canopy shall be within 25 feet of any street intersection; and (d)  Such canopy shall not cover more than 20 percent of the required yard over which it extends; and (e)  Such canopies shall remain unenclosed on three (3) sides. (4)  Service station pumps and pump islands: Service station pumps and pump islands may occupy a required yard adjacent to a street, provided that no portion of such pump island shall be closer than 12 feet to any street line, or closer than 25 feet to any street intersection. A service station pump island may include, as an integral part of said island, a pay booth provided that said pay booth shall not exceed 75 square feet in size and 10 feet in height. Such a pay booth must be designed for the sole and exclusive occupancy of one (1) station attendant and its use shall be limited to the collection of monies, control of essential functions such as pumps and lighting and similar administrative activities. (5)  Walls or fences in required yards; height limits: Fences, walls or hedges may occupy required yards as follows; provided, however, that such fence, wall or hedge shall be maintained in a safe and sightly condition and that no such walls or fences create substantial impediments to visibility as prohibiting at section 16-28.008(9). The height of a retaining wall shall be measured as the greatest vertical length from one side of finished grade to the top of said adjacent retaining wall unless specified below. (a)  In the R-1 through R-5 districts, the following retaining walls and fences are permitted: (1)  Within the required front and half-depth front yards: (i)  Where no retaining wall is constructed, fences not exceeding four feet in height may be erected. (ii)  Not more than two retaining walls with a maximum height of three feet each may be erected, provided however that the face of the upper wall shall be separated from the face of the lower wall by at least a minimum horizontal distance that is landscaped and equal in length to the height of the upper wall. (iii)  A fence not exceeding four feet is permitted at the top of one of the provided retaining walls. (2)  Within the required side and rear yards: (i)  Where no retaining wall is constructed, fences or walls not exceeding six feet in height may be erected or maintained. (ii)  Not more than two retaining walls with a maximum height of six feet each may be erected, provided however that the face of the upper wall shall be separated from the face of the lower wall by at least a minimum horizontal distance that is landscaped and equal in length to the height of the upper wall. (iii)  A fence not exceeding six feet is permitted at the top of one of the provided retaining walls. (3)  Where a driveway is required to be constructed, retaining wall height shall be measured above the existing undisturbed grade of the lot as established by plans meeting the specifications required for soil erosion and sedimentation control by section 74-40 (as it may be amended). (i)  For retaining walls in any required yard no greater than six feet in height shall be allowed. (ii)  For retaining walls in any required yard greater than six feet in height shall require a special exception from the board of zoning adjustment in accordance with provision (e) below. (b)  In the following residential general (R-G) district, fences not exceeding four feet in height may be erected in the front yard. Fences or walls not exceeding eight feet in height may be erected or maintained in the side or rear yards. (c)  The provisions of (a) and (b) above notwithstanding, in any dwelling district no fence or wall exceeding two and one-half feet in height, as measured from the grade at the intersecting street right-of-way lines, shall be erected or maintained within 20 feet of any street intersection. (d)  In all other districts, fences may be erected or maintained within any required yard provided they shall not exceed nine feet in height. (e)  Special exceptions on greater height of walls or fences in required yards: The board of zoning adjustment may grant special exceptions in any district for greater heights only upon finding that: 1.  Such wall or fence is justified by reason of security or privacy and will not unduly prevent passage of light and air to adjoining properties and is not incompatible with the character of the neighborhood; 2.  Such greater height is justified by requirements for security of persons or property in the area; 3.  Such greater height is justified for topographic reasons; or 4.  Such greater height, in the yard or yards involved, is not incompatible with the character of the surrounding neighborhood. (6)  Active recreation in yards adjacent to streets, residential districts, special exceptions: Swimming pools, tennis courts and other active recreation facilities shall not be permitted in connection with residential uses in residential districts in any yard, required or other, adjacent to a street, other than by special exception granted by the board of zoning adjustment. Such special exception shall be granted only upon findings that: (a)  The location will not be objectionable to occupants of neighboring property or the neighborhood in general by reason of noise, lights or concentrations of persons or vehicular traffic; and (b)  The area for such activity could not reasonably be located elsewhere on the lot.     In connection with such special exceptions, the board may attach conditions and safeguards, concerning fencing, screening or other buffering, existence and/or location of lighting, hours of use, and such other matters as are reasonably required to assure the tranquility of the neighborhood. (7)  Limitations on required off-street parking in required yards adjacent to streets in residential districts; limitations on paving such yards: Required off-street parking for uses in residential districts shall be permitted in required yards adjacent to streets only to the extent allowable under the following limitations: (a)  Such parking shall be permitted only in driveways within such yards, and no parking bays or parking outside such driveways shall be permitted. (b)  Maximum width of driveways for one- and two-family uses shall be limited to 20 feet (exclusive of flares at the throat); for multi-family uses, to 24 feet. (c)  Paved area in such driveways shall not exceed one-third of the total area of the required yard. There may be additional paved walkways not exceeding 10 percent of the required yard. The remainder of the required yard shall be maintained in landscaping. Neither walkways nor landscaped area shall be used for parking, required or other, or for the storage of vehicles. The requirements as stated above may be waived through the approval of a special administrative permit as required in section 16-28.011(6) for zero-lot-line development in the R-5 Two-Family dwelling district. (d)  Limitations on the use of required yards for the purpose of parking or paving for purposes of parking, loading or servicing in certain districts: Except as permitted above, no required yard in the R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4 and R-5, R-G, R-LC and O-I districts shall be paved for the purpose of parking, loading or servicing; nor shall any yard be used for parking, loading or servicing. (8)  Bus passenger shelters permitted generally; limitations on location: Bus passenger shelters shall be permitted in any district. Such shelters may be erected in any required yard adjacent to a street, provided that in residential districts and in cases where other districts adjoin residential districts without an intervening street or alley, no such shelter shall be erected within 10 feet of any property line intersecting the street, or in locations impeding traffic visibility at street intersections or intersections of driveways with streets.     When located in an SPI-1, SPI-2, SPI-3 or SPI-4 district, bus passenger shelters shall comply with the applicable provisions of the pedestrian space plan (pedestrian circulation plan). No building permit for a bus passenger shelter shall be issued unless a special administrative permit shall have been issued by the director, bureau of planning, under the provisions of sections 16-18.005, 16-18.007 and 16-25.004.     When located in any other district, bus passenger shelters shall be located so that they are adjacent to a public sidewalk that provides a minimum of five (5) feet of unobstructed pedestrian space. No building permit for a bus passenger shelter shall be issued unless a special administrative permit shall have been issued by the director, bureau of planning, under the provisions of section 16-25.004. (9)  Visibility at intersections: In any district in which yards are generally required adjacent to streets, nothing shall be erected, placed, planted or allowed to grow in such a manner as to materially impede visibility between the heights of two and one-half (2½) feet above the grade of the adjoining sidewalk or right-of-way and eight (8) feet within visibility triangles as described below. (a)  At street intersections: At street intersections, such visibility triangles shall be maintained to include an area bounded by the first 20 feet along the intersecting edges of the right-of-way (projected where the right-of-way is rounded) and a line connecting the ends of such 20-foot lines. (b)  At intersections of driveways with streets: At intersections of driveways with streets, such visibility triangles shall be maintained to include an area bounded by the first 20 feet along the intersecting edges of the roadway and 20 feet along the intersecting edges of the roadway and driveway (driving surfaces) projected where rounded and a line connecting the ends of such lines. (10)  Peddlers and itinerant vendors: Peddlers and itinerant vendors conducting business out-of-doors on private property may conduct such business only in compliance with the following: (a)  They must have the written expressed consent of the owner to use the business property on which they propose to operate. (b)  They must have a valid city business license unless otherwise exempted by city ordinance. (c)  The business use must be a use that is otherwise allowed within the zoning district in which the peddlers or itinerant vendors operate the business. (d)  The business may not be conducted within the required front and side yard setbacks required by the zoning district in which the business is operated. (e)  Such business shall not be conducted on or from vacant lots. (f)  Vending on private property shall also comply with the requirements of Chapter 30, Article XXIV, Vending on Private Property. (11)  Special exception for satellite receiving dish antennae in the one- and two-family residential districts: Satellite receiving dish antennae shall not be permitted in the one- and two-family residential districts (R-1 through R-5) other than by special exception granted by the board of zoning adjustment. The board may permit the antennae to be erected in any yard, required or other, or attached to the primary or an accessory structure. However, such special exception shall be granted only upon a finding that: (a)  The location will not be objectionable to occupants of neighboring property or the neighborhood in general by reason of visual unsightliness, a potential hazard to pedestrian or vehicular traffic movement, or the obstruction of light or air to adjoining properties; and (b)  The equipment could not reasonably be located elsewhere on the lot. Provided, however, that a problem related solely to signal reception standards shall not be considered sufficient grounds for granting relief under this paragraph.     In connection with such special exceptions, the board may attach conditions and safeguards concerning fencing, screening or other buffering and such other matters as are reasonably required to assure the tranquility of the neighborhood. (12)  Temporary Storage Containers on single and two-family residential lots: For purposes of this section, the phrase "temporary storage container" shall mean a portable, weather resistant container holding 200 cubic feet or more of storage capacity that is designed and used for the temporary storage or shipment of household furniture, clothing, and other household goods, excluding refuse, and is transported by truck or trailer to desired locations for drop off and retrieval. In the R-1 through R-5 zoning districts, and on all other lots containing an existing single or two-family residential dwelling, temporary storage containers shall be temporarily authorized as accessory to such existing residential principal structures only when in compliance with each of the following requirements: (a)  Only one (1) temporary storage container is authorized per each such residential lot for a period of time not to exceed 90 days in any 365 day period. This 90 day time limit may be extended only by issuance of a building permit for an accessory shed/garage structure pursuant to the procedures and criteria of the Office of Buildings; and (b)  Temporary storage containers shall not be located within the visibility triangle set forth in section 16-28.007(9) and shall not be located within 10 feet of the front lot line. Temporary storage containers shall not be located within any public right-of-way, street or sidewalk unless a permit to do so has been issued pursuant to section 138-61 of the Code of Ordinances, provided that no such permit may exceed the 90 day time limit set forth in subsection 12(a) above. (Code 1977, § 16-28.008; Ord. No. 2002-4, § 3, 2-12-02; Ord. No. 2003-86, § 1, 8-21-03; Ord. No. 2007-48(07-O-0642), § 6, 8-23-07; Ord. No. 2007-50(07-O-0497), § 1, 9-13-07; Ord. No. 2018-11(18-O-1023), §§ 1.B, 13, 5-16-18 ) 
Sec. 16-28.009. - R-G and PD-H districts and other districts in which similar attached and multi-family residential uses are permitted.     R-G and PD-H districts permit attached and multi-family dwellings and mixtures of dwellings types, as do certain other districts. Residential uses in such districts require special forms of regulations, some features of which are applicable to other uses. The provisions which follow in section 16-28.010 relate to the Residential-General (R-G) District, to open space and building space requirements applying in such district, or to such uses in other districts and to other special requirements and limitations applicable thereto. For the purpose of clarifying the application of the floor area ratio calculation in single-family and two-family zoning districts, net lot area shall be used. (Code 1977, § 16-28.009; Ord. No. 2007-48(07-O-0642), § 7, 8-23-07) 
Sec. 16-28.010. - Definitions and methods of measurements relating to the Residential General Sectors 1—5; requirements and limitations.     The following definitions and methods of measurement shall be used in the districts and for the uses regulated in the R-G district. Except where application to other uses is specifically indicated, floor area, total open space, useable open space and related elements are as allocated for residential uses and accessory uses incidental to and compatible with residential uses. (1)  Gross land area of R-G and PD-H districts: Gross land area of PD-H districts shall be computed as all land (except that to be devoted to nonresidential purposes) within district boundaries plus half of adjoining permanent open space such as streets, parks, lakes, cemeteries and the like; provided that dimensions of such open space credited shall be limited to no more than 50 feet. Computations involving such open space shall be as provided at section 16-28.007(2)(b) for gross area of regular lots. (2)  Residential land area: In computing the gross land area in the PD-H district, the gross land area shall be construed to include residential land for residential development and related uses, including open space, within the district, or on the lot or tract where residential uses in other locations are regulated. Such lands shall be construed to include streets entirely within the residential portion of the development and lands accepted for dedication for public purposes. Residential land area shall not be construed to include lands not beneficial to residential use due to location or character, or areas used predominantly for commercial or other nonresidential purposes.     As a further guide, where floor area of a building is predominantly in residential use, the building site shall be included in residential land area (as for example, in the case of a multi-family structure with 10 percent of its floor area in accessory commercial and service uses). (3)  Residential floor area: Residential floor area is the sum of areas for residential use on all floors of buildings, measured from the outside faces of the exterior walls, including halls, lobbies, stairways, elevator shafts, enclosed porches and balconies, and below-grade floor areas used for habitation and residential access. Not countable as residential floor area are: (1)  Open terraces, patios, atriums or balconies; (2)  Carports, garages, breezeways, tool sheds; (3)  Special-purpose areas for common use of occupants, such as recreation rooms or social halls; (4)  Staff space for therapy or examination in care housing; (5)  Basement space not used for living accommodations; or (6)  Any commercial or other nonresidential space.     Maximum residential floor area shall not exceed the number of square feet by multiplying gross residential land area by the floor area ratio (FAR) applying in the appropriate R-G number designation. (4)  Total open space: (a)  Definitions: Total open space, uncovered total open space, covered total open space: 1.  Total open space is the total horizontal area of uncovered open space plus half the total horizontal area of covered open space subject to limitations set forth below. 2.  Uncovered total open space is the gross residential land area not covered by buildings, plus open exterior balconies and roof area improved as recreation space. 3.  Covered total open space is the open space closed to the sky but having two clear unobstructed open or partially open sides.     Partially open is to be construed as 50 percent open or more. Examles of covered open space are covered balconies, covered portions of improved roof area, or spaces under building, supported by posts, columns or cantilevers. The square feet countable as covered open space shall not exceed the square footage of the open sides. (b)  Minimum total open space required shall not be less than the number of square feet derived by multiplying gross residential land area by total open space ratio (TOSR) applying in the appropriate R-G number designation. (5)  Useable open space: (a)  Defined: Useable open space is part of total open space appropriately improved and located for outdoor living space for residents and for aesthetic appeal. Such space includes lawns and other landscaped areas, walkways, paved terraces and sitting areas, outdoor recreational areas and landscaped portions of street rights-of-way. Such space shall not be used for vehicles, except for incidental service, maintenance or emergency actions. (b)  Minimum requirement: Minimum useable open space required shall not be less than the number of square feet derived by multiplying gross residential land area by the useable open space ratio (UOSR) applying the appropriate R-G number designation. (6)  Parking requirements: (a)  Defined: An off-street parking space is garage, carport or other uncovered off-street parking space, together with appropriate access and maneuvering ways. (b)  Minimum car space requirement: The parking ratio for the applicable R-G number designation times the number of dwelling or lodging units equals the number of parking spaces required. (Code 1977, § 16-28.010) 
Sec. 16-28.011. - Open space and building spacing in R-G and PD-H districts and other districts in which similar attached and multi-family uses are permitted. (1)  Intent; Application: Yards, courts, and other open space required herein in relation to structures or portions of structures containing living quarters are intended to perform a variety of functions. Among these (as appropriate to and required by the uses involved and their location) are assuring adequate privacy, desirable views, natural light and ventilation, access to and around buildings, off-street parking and loading space and service areas, space for landscaping, spacing between buildings and portions of buildings for reducing potential adverse effects of noise, odor, glare, or hazards from fire and recreational space near buildings.     These regulations, supplementing those set forth elsewhere herein with respect to R-G and PD-H districts and other districts in which similar attached and multi-family uses are permitted, shall apply to yards, courts, other open space and building spacing in such districts, and measurements and interpretations with regard thereto. (2)  Required Yards and Courts Need Not Be At Ground Level; Exception: Except in the case of fixed yards required adjacent to streets, required yards and courts relating to residential uses controlled by these regulations need not be at ground level if, and to the extent that, in other locations their functions, nature, orientation, area, access and improvement are appropriate to uses within the building and adjoining buildings, and particularly to adjacent uses at the same level of the building and overviewing uses in the same or nearby buildings. These requirements are intended to reduce unnecessary fragmentation of open space around buildings and to encourage provisions of such space in locations and dimensions providing broader functional utility, and not to reduce total amount of such space required. (3)  Permanent Open Space in Public Streets: Common Open Space May Be Included as Part of Building Spacing Requirements. Limitations: Where lots or building sites adjoining permanent open space in public streets, common open space, or other open space intended to remain so in perpetuity, half of the width of such open space may be included in meeting building spacing requirements. (4)  Spacing Determinations Where Two or More Residential Buildings Area on a Lot: Where two (2) or more buildings containing living quarters are to be located on a single lot or tract, building sites pertaining to each shall be identified. On determinations concerning compliance with spacing requirements, open spaces shall be provided adjacent to lines of the building site as though they were lot lines. (5)  Building Spacing Requirements: Spacing requirements for buildings or portions of buildings containing living quarters shall be based on the horizontal length and number of stories. (a)  Length of walls: Length of walls shall be measured as the horizontal distance from corner to corner. Where walls in continuous general frontage (as in the case of attached dwellings) are offset by angles or setbacks of six (6) feet or more, length of each segment so set off shall be measured separately in establishing pertinent yard depth. Where walls in continuous general frontage enclose portions of buildings varying one (1) story or more in height, length of each segment so varying shall be measured separately in computing pertinent yard depth. Length of a curved or irregularly shaped wall shall be construed as the shortest distance between the wall's end corners. Length of the wall of a circular building shall be construed as the diameter of the building. (b)  Height in stories: Height in stories shall be computed as actual number of stories above ground level with the following exceptions: Where the wall is along a slope, number of stories shall be construed as the arithmetic mean number, with half a story or more considered as a full story, and less than half a story ignored in computations. When height per story exceeds an average of 12 feet, calculations involved in yard or spacing determinations shall be based on an assumed number of stories derived by dividing building height by 12 feet (see section 16-28.022(1)). (c)  Yard or other space depth; how measured: Yard or other open space depth between exterior building walls and adjacent lot or building site lines (projected vertically where appropriate) shall be measured horizontally in relation to the ground, and perpendicular to straight walls or radially to curved walls.

Except in the case of single-family or two-family detached or semidetached residences, such space shall be provided with maneuvering room sufficient for convenient parking or unparking without maneuvering on any public street, alley or sidewalk. Spaces shall be so arranged that any automobile may be moved without moving another.     For computation purposes, an off-street parking space in itself may be considered to consist of 180 square feet; the space plus its related access and maneuvering room may be considered to require a total of 300 square feet; but off-street parking requirements shall be considered to be met only where actual spaces meet the performance standards set forth herein.     Required off-street parking areas for four (4) or more automobiles shall have individual spaces marked. All off-street parking spaces and related access shall be graded, paved, improved and maintained in a manner permitting safe and convenient use under normal weather conditions, and so as to avoid adverse effects on public streets or neighboring property as a result of dust, erosion or drainage. Grading, design, subsurface preparation, paving and drainage shall be in accordance with standards established by the department of public works.     Where off-street parking is required for 10 or more automobiles, 25 percent of the number of spaces provided may be designed for use by compact automobiles, but such space shall be reserved for use by such automobiles.     Within flood hazard districts, the director, bureau of buildings may allow such parking and access ways to be improved with gravel or other material which will, through its permeability, aid in reducing the danger of flooding. (2)  Reduction in parking requirements for housing for the elderly : Reduction of generally applicable off-street parking requirements shall be allowed in all zoning districts, subject to the following requirements and limitations: (a)  The minimum off-site parking requirement shall be reduced to 0.5 space per dwelling unit when the otherwise applicable off-street parking ratio exceeds 0.5 space per dwelling unit. (b)  No such reduction shall be permitted except where it is assured that housing will be used by families with head of the household 62 years of age or older (provided that not more than ten percent of the number of persons housed may be employees on the premises, without regard to age). (c)  The premises shall not be used other than as housing for the elderly, subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth in (b) above, unless and until any parking requirements applying to the new use have been met. Housing for the elderly is not to be construed as including establishments which are primarily convalescent and nursing home. (3)  Buffering parking areas where adjoining property is residential: Where parking areas for four (4) or more automobiles are located adjacent to any lot upon which a dwelling exists as a conforming use, without an intervening street, and where such parking areas are not screened visually from first floor residential windows at such locations, there shall be provided on the lot with the parking a continuous buffer screening such parking area from such view, with a height of six (6) feet. The buffer shall be fence or wall or equivalent vegetative screening, maintained in a sightly condition. (4)  Limitations on parking or loading areas in yards adjacent to streets in R, O-I and PD-H districts: Except as otherwise specifically provided in R, O-I and PD-H districts, no off-street parking areas for four (4) or more automobiles, and no loading space, shall be permitted in any required yard adjacent to a street; and no maneuvering areas serving such spaces shall be so located. (5)  Other limitations on use of off-street parking and loading areas: No required unenclosed off-street parking and loading area shall be used for the sale, repair, dismantling or servicing of any vehicles, equipment, materials or supplies; and no other area on a lot shall be used for such purposes. Nothwithstanding the foregoing prohibition, the servicing of equipment required for EVSE or electric vehicle charging stations is permitted. (6)  Bicycle parking requirements. (a)  Bicycle parking shall be provided for each building as specified in the following "Table of Bicycle Parking Requirements." Bicycle parking requirement shall be calculated based on gross floor area and shall be calculated separately for separate buildings. Table of Bicycle Parking Requirements Fixed Bicycle Rack Parking Spaces Enclosed Bicycle Parking Spaces Maximum Combined Requirement Residential Uses Multifamily (less than 10 units) 1 per 5 units, 2 min. n/a No more than 50 spaces required Multifamily (10 or more units) 1 per 10 units, 2 min. 1 per 10 units, 2 min. No more than 50 spaces required Non-residential uses Offices 1 per 8,000 sf, 2 min. 1 per 8,000 sf, 2 min. No more than 50 spaces required All other non-residential uses 1 per 4,000 sf, 2 min. n/a No more than 50 spaces required  (b)  Fixed bicycle racks parking spaces shall conform to the following minimum standards: i.  Shall not be located inside a building, but may be covered. ii.  Shall be publicly accessible and provided with lighting at all hours. iii.  Shall be spaced to provide clear and maneuverable access to a public street or multi-use trail without the use of stairs. iv.  Shall be located on-site or in the adjacent public right-of-way. v.  Shall include a metal anchor sufficient to secure the bicycle frame when used in conjunction with a user-supplied lock. vi.  When located on-site, shall be located at least as close as the closest automobile space serving the building, except for handicapped parking spaces. vii.  When located in the public right-of way, shall not impede pedestrian use of the sidewalk and shall only be located within a street furniture and tree planting zone a maximum distance of 100 feet of the building entrance the rack is intended to serve. viii.  When located in the public right-of-way, shall be of a type specified by the Office of Zoning and Development in coordination with the Department of Public Works. ix.  When two bikes can be locked on both sides without conflict, each side can be counted as one required space. (c)  Enclosed bicycle parking spaces shall conform to the following minimum standards: i.  Shall provide enclosed bicycle storage in lockers, a room within a building, or within a parking structure. ii.  Shall be accessible to all building occupants and to public entrances and walkways, secure, weather resistant, and provided with lighting at all hours. iii.  Shall provide clear and maneuverable access to a public street or multi-use trail without the use of stairs or elevators. (d)  Buildings containing over 50,000 gross square feet of office space shall provide showering facilities, which shall include showers and lockers, in a ratio of at least two showering facilities for every 50,000 gross square feet of office space in excess of 50,000 square feet.

The applicant shall be required to notify the city arborist of the death of the tree(s) within 30 days. The director, bureau of buildings shall not grant such a reduction in the required number of parking spaces for any property which fails to provide the required number of off-street parking spaces as a result of having status as a nonconforming use, or as the result of a previously granted variance or special exception for the property by the board of zoning adjustment. (10)  In each case, when the director, bureau of buildings grants a reduction the required number of parking spaces as authorized in subsection (9), the director shall grant his approval in writing, in a form which he shall establish, and shall provide copies of such written approval to the applicant, the city arborist, the director, bureau of planning, and the chair of the NPU in which the property is located. (11)  Incentive for electric vehicles charging stations and parking. Where off-street parking is required to be provided or where the off-street parking requirement is being met by parking on a private street, each electric vehicle charging station, as defined in Section 16-29.001, shall be counted as a parking space and shall reduce the required parking by one additional parking space; provided however that a total of no more than ten percent of the number of off-street parking spaces required by the district regulations for the entire parcel shall be allowed to be reduced by the use of this incentive. Where at least two electric vehicle charging stations are provided, the ten percent reduction incentive may be accomplished by providing electric vehicle only parking spaces provided however that the number of electric vehicle only parking spaces to be counted for the incentive shall always be correlated to the number of electric vehicle charging stations. In no case shall the use of this incentive reduce the requirement to provide at least one off-street parking for each single-family dwelling unit, duplex, triplex or quadraplex. (a)  The provisions of this section shall apply to any required parking and may be used to reduce the degree of nonconformity of parcels with nonconforming parking. (b)  Electric vehicle parking spaces shall be reserved for the exclusive parking of an electric vehicle. (c)  Electric vehicle charging stations shall be reserved exclusively for the charging and parking of a vehicle that is connected to the EVSE for electric charging purposes. (d)  When an electric vehicle charging station is removed or becomes inoperable for more than fourteen consecutive days, the parking reduction granted by this section shall no longer remain in effect and the required parking shall be provided. (e)  The incentive provided by this section shall be granted by special administrative permit. (i)  As a part of the application, the site plan for the parking spaces where the electric vehicle charging station or electric vehicle parking is to be located shall be provided. (ii)  The special administrative permit shall at all times be conditioned on the electric vehicle charging station or electric vehicle parking meeting the design standards and other criteria for electric vehicle parking and charging facilities set forth in this part. (iii)  Failure to maintain the conditions of the special administrative permit shall be cause to revoke the incentive and require the installation of the parking required by the district regulations. (12)  Reduction in parking requirements for on-street parking: A reduction of the generally applicable minimum off-street parking requirements shall be allowed in all zoning districts as follows: (a)  Where on-street parking spaces exist in a public right-of-way, one on-street parking space may be substituted for every required off-street parking space, provided the on-street space immediately abuts the subject property. (b)  Each on-street parking space shall only be counted for one property.

The failure to maintain the number of electric vehicle charging stations and parking spaces shall be cause to require the installation of the number of parking spaces required by the district regulations. (g)  A phone number or other contact information shall be provided when the station is not functioning in a manner that allows electric vehicles to be charged. (3)  Criteria for electric vehicle parking and charging stations on private streets (a)  On-street parking spaces designated and equipped to be electric vehicle charging stations spaces for which any parking incentive was granted on private streets shall be for the exclusive purpose of electric charging. (b)  For the purpose of reducing cable management issues and placing the electric vehicle charging station closer to crosswalks and curb ramps, such charging stations shall be installed to use the last space on a block face in the direction of travel wherever possible. (c)  In perpendicular or angle parking configurations, electric vehicle supply equipment should be centered, or to the left, in front of the electric vehicle charging station for single connectors, and placed between two electric vehicle charging stations for dual connectors. (i)  EVSE must be mounted on the wall or on a structure at the end of the space provided and shall be placed at least four feet above the parking surface of the space. No charging devices may be placed within the dimensions of a space on the sides or entrance to a space (ii)  EVSE mounted on structures such as pedestals, lighting posts, bollards, or other device shall be located as to not impede pedestrian travel or create trip hazards (d)  Where a variation is grated to allow the electric vehicle charging station in parallel parking configurations, EVSE should be installed near the front of the electric vehicle charging station based on the direction of travel. (e)  When electric vehicle supply equipment is placed in a sidewalk or walkway adjacent to the on-street electric vehicle charging station, it should not interfere with the minimum pedestrian clearance widths as defined in Chapter 11B of the American Disability Act Standard as it may be from time to time amended. (f)  When cords and connectors are not in use, retraction devices or locations for storage shall be located sufficiently above the pedestrian surface and the parking lot as to reduce conflicts with pedestrians and vehicle maneuvering. Cords, cables, and connector equipment shall not extend across the path of travel in any sidewalk or walkway. (4)  Signage: The signage associated with electric vehicle charging stations and the reservation of parking spaces for electric vehicles shall be considered incidental signs as defined in the Sign Ordinance. Incidental signs may contain only information and directives concerning the use of the electric vehicle charging stations and the reservation of parking spaces for electric vehicles. No commercial message shall be allowed to be displayed on an incidental sign associated electric vehicle charging stations and the reservation of parking spaces for electric vehicles although the name of the manufacturer or installer of the station may be displayed on the equipment installed at the stations. Where any text or logo other than that contained in this subsection is necessary to provide the general public with information on the operation of the electric vehicle charging stations, a sign permit shall be required. The following signs are allowed without a sign permit: (a)  General service signs . An EV general service sign may be displayed without an associated advance turn and direction arrow but no advance turn and direct arrow may be displayed without an EV general service sign. These signs should be no smaller than 12-inch by 18-inch and no larger than 18-inch by 124-inch. The bottom of sign shall be seven feet above ground. (b)  Private regulatory mounted signage. One private regulatory sign may be located on each space and must be placed to conform to the design guidelines for parking spaces. (c)  On-space striping: the following on space striping is permitted in lieu of or in addition to a mounted private regulatory sign. (5)  Minimum landscaping requirements for surface electric vehicle parking and charging station lots. The requirements of City of Atlanta Code of Ordinances, Chapter 158 Vegetation, Article II, Tree Protection, Section 30, parking lot requirements shall apply to electric vehicle charging stations spaces in addition to the street tree planting requirements, with additional requirements as follows: (a)  All parking bays shall be terminated with a landscape strip a minimum width of five feet and equal to the length of the parking bay. (b)  All required landscaped areas shall be planted with evergreen groundcover or shrubs with a maximum mature height of 30 inches; and (c)  All required landscaped buffer strips, regardless of length, shall have a minimum of one tree planted per 30 feet of length with a minimum caliper of two and one-half inches. (d)  Existing parking lots shall not be required to reduce the number of parking spaces by more than three percent as a result of implementing the following surface parking lot landscaping regulations. (6)  Where EVSE is being used exclusively for the charging of vehicles for commercial or industrial uses and is not being made available for the general public, the installation of such equipment shall not be required to meet the criteria for parking spaces made available to the general public but shall be required to be installed to meet National Electric Code Article 625 as it may be from time to time amended. ( Ord. No. 2014-53(14-O-1278), § 4(Attach. D), 12-10-14 ) 
Secs. 16-28.018—16-28.020. - Reserved. 
Sec. 16-28.021. - Drive-in establishments; car washes.     No permit shall be issued for any drive-in bank, drive-in theater or other facility where customers are served in their automobiles, for any car wash (except where such installations are accessory to other principal use and do not involve facilities for washing more than one (1) car at a time) without approval of the bureau of traffic and transportation as to the adequacy of entrance and exit facilities, reservoir spaces adjacent to service facilities, provision for circulation, and layout of parking areas.     The bureau of traffic and transportation may prohibit left-turn movements entering or leaving such establishment, may limit hours when such movements may be made, may require construction of merging lanes adjacent to entrances or exists, and may make such other requirements as are reasonably necessary to assure safety to pedestrians and motorists and to avoid inconvenience and traffic congestion.     In particular, in bound and outbound reservoir spaces (defined as spaces for automobiles waiting for service or parking after clearing the right-of-way of the street, and spaces for automobiles which have left service or parking areas and are waiting to enter the right-of-way of the street) shall be provided at a minimum as indicated below. All such spaces at these and other establishments requiring reservoir spaces shall be a minimum of 22 feet long and 10 feet wide, with additional space for necessary turning and maneuvering.     Drive-in bank: Six (6) spaces before each service position; one (1) space after service space.     Drive-in theater: Before the ticket service space reservoir space equal to 20 percent of the total capacity of the theater. The inbound reservoir area shall not connect or conflict in any way with exit driveways.     Car washes: Self-service: Three (3) spaces before each wash stall. Semiautomatic: 20 spaces before the beginning of each wash line; three (3) spaces after the end of each wash line. Automatic dragline: 40 spaces before the beginning of each wash line, six (6) spaces after the end of each wash line.     Other drive-in facilities (including but not limited to food and beverage sales, and laundry and dry cleaning pickup stations): Three (3) spaces before service position; one (1) space after service position. (Code 1977, § 16-28.021) 
Sec. 16-28.022. - Height; excluded portions of structures. (1)  Excluded portion of structures : Except as specifically provided herein, the height limitations of this part shall not apply to any roof structures for housing elevators, stairways, tanks, ventilating fans or similar equipment required to operate and maintain the building, nor to church spires, steeples, belfries, cupolas, domes, monuments, water towers, fire or parapet walls, roof signs, skylights, flagpoles, chimneys, smokestacks, silos, energy generation structures or similar structures, which may be erected above the height limit.     Antennas, except satellite receiving dish antennas regulated under section 16-28.008 (11) of the zoning ordinance, shall not be subject to the general height limitation specified in any district; provided however, that when antennas are permitted, they shall be subject to all individual district regulations for such antennas, as well as the regulations, standards and criteria, including height limitations, established in section 16-25.002 (3)(i). (2)  Aviation hazards: No building or other structure (regardless of exclusion as set forth in (1) above) shall be located in a manner or built to a height which constitutes a hazard to aviation. Where a structure is proposed in a location or to be built to a height which the building official believes may be hazardous to air traffic, such structure shall not be erected without certification from the Atlanta Department of Aviation, or its successor in function if its title is changed, that as proposed to be located, constructed and equipped, it will not constitute a hazard to air traffic. (See also chapter 22, "Airport Districts - Special Requirements and Procedures.") (Code 1977, § 16-28.022; Ord. No. 2019-09(18-O-1581), § 9.6, 1-31-19 ) 
Sec. 16-28.023. - Transfer of development rights. (1)  Intent. For the purposes of conserving and promoting the public health, safety and general welfare and preserving natural, environmental, historical and cultural resources, this ordinance allows and controls the severance of development rights from a sending property and the transfer of development rights to a receiving property. (2)  Definitions. (a)  Development rights: Calculated units of development factors that would be allowed on the buildable area of the sending property under its present zoning category disregarding any variance or non-conformity that may presently allow a greater number of development units. Where a zoning category does not require calculation of development rights, no development rights are available for transfer. (b)  Development factors: Quantified units of transferable development rights that may be severed from a sending property or directly transferred to a receiving property. Density as expressed by floor area ratio; total open space; and usable open space, available to the sending property but which remains unused at the time that the sending property will be dedicated are the only development factors that may be severed from a sending property or transferred to a receiving property. (c)  Sending area: An area consisting of one or more parcels or lots which can qualify to be a sending property. A sending area may be: (1)  An area consisting of one or more than one parcel or lot, if contiguous, which is zoned in any category R-1 through R-5 on one portion of the parcel(s) or lot(s) and also zoned RG on another portion of the same parcel(s) or lot(s), provided however that such property must be used for single-family or two-family residential purposes and no other use is allowed by any special permit. Such areas may also be referred to as residential sending areas; (2)  The boundaries of any property designated as a landmark building or site or historic building or site pursuant to the City of Atlanta Historic Preservation Ordinance; (3)  One or more lots or parcels that are suitable to be donated to and accepted by the city, and will be dedicated for use as greenspace by an instrument to be recorded in the office of county clerk in which the property is located or property that will be purchased by the city for use as greenspace. (4)  One or more lots or parcels providing affordable workforce housing units in compliance with chapter 36A of this part. (d)  Sending property: A parcel or lot in a sending area or a parcel or lot with special characteristics including but not limited to: woodland; flood plain; natural habitats; wetlands; groundwater recharge area; marsh hammocks; recreation areas or parkland, including golf course areas; or land that has unique aesthetic, architectural, or historic value that is found by the governing body to be deserving of protection from future development and which will be dedicated to that use when the development rights are severed or directly transferred to a sending property. (e)  Receiving area: Any area zoned with a classification that allows multi-family residential uses or mixed use, provided that such mixed use has a residential component of at least 50 percent. (f)  Receiving property: A specific parcel or lot where development rights may be increased through the issuance of a special permit allowing the receipt of the calculated units of development factors defined in this subsection. The governing body shall determine appropriateness and suitability of a receiving property based on its determination that there are no substantially adverse, environmental, economic or social impact on the receiving property or on neighboring properties pursuant to the procedures set forth in this section. A receiving property shall be appropriate and suitable for the increased development allowed by the receipt of the additional development rights to be transferred and no receiving property may be developed in variance from the zoning district regulations in order to accommodate the use of transferable development rights, unless such variance is specifically shown on the site plan submitted with the special permit application. (g)  Transfer of development rights: The process by which development rights are severed from a sending property and affixed to one or more receiving properties. (h)  Special permit for transferred development rights: A special permit issued by the governing body after approval of an application as set forth in this section. A special permit application made pursuant to this section shall, in addition to the requirements set forth herein, meet the requirements for special permits set forth in section 16-25.002(3). (3)  Sending areas and properties. (a)  Residential sending areas. The designation of a parcel or lot as a part of a residential sending area is not a declaration that the development rights are automatically severable or transferable. In order for any development rights to be severed or transferred, the applicant must show that the future use to be made of the part of the sending property from which the development rights are severed or transferred meets the requirements of this section and section 16-25.002(3). The calculation of the development factors to be transferred shall use only the square footage of that portion of the lot which is zoned RG and such calculation shall not use the entire square footage of the lot. The entire lot, including the RG portion, may in the future be used in any manner allowed by the particular R-1through R-5 zoning on the remaining parcel. A residential sending area may only send development rights to another residential use. Individual contiguous properties in a sending area as defined in this section may apply under one special permit for the transfer of development rights. (b)  Historic preservation designation for individual sending properties. Any property designated as a landmark building or site or historic building or site may, apply to sever or transfer the development rights not utilized by the present development of the historic property. The historic nomination or designation is not a declaration that the development rights are automatically severable or transferable. In order for any development rights to be severed or transferred, the applicant must show that the future use of the property from which the development rights are severed or transferred meets the requirements of this section and section 16-25.002(3). Approval of the severance or transfer of development rights shall not be a condition of approval of the historic designation, but no development rights shall be transferred until after the property is designated as a landmark building or site or historic building or site. Rights transferred from a designated building or site may be applied to any permitted use, which would be allowed on the designated property. Any redevelopment of the designated property from which the rights have been transferred or severed must be based on the remaining development rights and on the conditions under which the special permit was granted. No part of this section is intended to waive, alter, lessen or otherwise change the application of the City of Atlanta Historic Preservation Ordinance on future redevelopment of the designated property. (c)  Greenspace sending areas or properties. Before property in a greenspace sending area may sever or transfer development rights, such transfer must be approved either in the same transaction as the purchase or dedication by approval of the application by the governing body or by separate application filed no later than 90 days after the transfer of the property to the city. In order to become a greenspace sending property, a parcel or lot must be the type of property, which would meet the definition set forth in O.C.G.A. § 36-22-2(3) (as amended). Any property purchased by the city for use as greenspace need not be acquired with funds made available from the community greenspace trust fund to be eligible as a greenspace sending property but in all purchases made by the city, the purchase price of the property must be reduced by the appraised value of any development rights which are severed or transferred. (4)  Receiving areas and properties. (a)  Receiving areas. The designation of a parcel or lot as a part of a receiving area is not a declaration that development rights may be received by such parcel or lot. In order for any development rights to be received by a parcel or lot, the applicant must show that the future use to be made of the receiving property is in compliance with the terms of this section and section 16-25.002(3). Contiguous individual parcels or lots which are being developed under common ownership may apply to receive development rights under a single application but shall indicate the manner in which the rights to be received are being allocated among the parcels. (b)  Residential receiving properties. A specific parcel in a receiving area, which is proposed for a multi-family use, or a parcel which is proposed for a mixed use with a residential component comprising more than 50 percent of the floor area of the development, is eligible to apply to become a receiving property. (c)  Receiving properties for development rights from historic designation. Rights transferred from a landmark building or site or historic building or site may be applied to any permitted use, which would be allowed on the property from which the rights were transferred. The fact that such rights were transferred by a historic designation is not a declaration that the development rights may be received by a property. In order for any development rights to be received by a property, the applicant must show that the future use of the property meets the requirements of this section. No part of this section is intended to waive, alter, lessen or otherwise change the application of the City of Atlanta Historic Preservation Ordinance on redevelopment of any designated property through the use of transferred development rights. (5)  Application for TDR special permit. (a)  Sending area or property: Owners of properties in sending areas or properties with special characteristics that are to be designated, developed or used in a manner consistent with the stated intent of this ordinance may apply to the governing body for the severance or direct transfer of development rights in accord with the procedures listed in this section. Each such application shall contain the following: (i)  A description of the special characteristics of the property and an explanation of the manner in which those special characteristics advance and promote the intent of this ordinance. (ii)  A map and a legal description of the property from which the transfer is proposed. (iii)  An original and fully executed instrument to be recorded in the office of county clerk in which the property is located which states that current landowner and any person with an interest in the property, including without limitation any lienholders, consent to the prohibitions against future use of the property except in accordance with the conditions stated as the basis for the transfer of the development rights. Such instrument shall also state that such prohibitions shall be binding on the landowner or any other person with an interest in the property as of the date that the instrument is recorded and that this instrument shall bind every successor in interest to the landowner or any other person with an interest in the property. (iv)  A calculation of the amount of quantified development factors that are proposed to be severed or transferred. (v)  A statement specifying whether the development rights are to be transferred to a receiving property or are to be held for future use. If the development rights are to be transferred to a receiving property under the same ordinance authorizing the severance of the development rights, the application shall be in the form of a joint application, which shall be considered by the governing body under the procedures set forth in this section referring to joint applications. If the development rights are to be severed and held by the owner of the sending property, the application shall include the form of a deed of transferable development rights which shall after approval of the transfer vest in the owner of the property and be deemed appurtenant to the sending body until the transferable development right is registered as a distinct interest in real property with the appropriate tax assessor or the transferable development right is used at a receiving property and becomes appurtenant thereto. (b)  Receiving area or property: Owners of properties, in a receiving area or property eligible to receive development rights from designated historic properties, that seek to develop such property in a manner which requires density expressed as floor area ratio, total open space, or usable open space above that resulting from the calculations applied to the property sought to be developed under its present zoning, may apply to increase amount of such factors which may be applied to the property by application for special permit for the receipt of transferred development rights. Each application shall contain the following: (i)  An affidavit from the property owner consenting to the use of the transferred development rights and stating that all such rights sought to be utilized pursuant to the application are fully and unconditionally owned by the property owner. Such affidavit shall also acknowledge that the use of the transferable development rights necessary to complete the project shall, upon approval of the application, remain with the property for the life of the development and cannot be severed from the property or otherwise transferred without the property being declared a sending property pursuant to subsequent application. (ii)  A map and a legal description of the property to receive the transferred development rights. (iii)  A statement in the form of an affidavit from the property owner identifying the source of the transferable development rights to be used by the receiving property. Said statement shall detail the ownership of the transferable development rights to be used back to the transaction(s) that created such development rights and shall specify the amount that are to be applied to the receiving property. (iv)  A section which explains how the project meets the requirements for special permits set forth in section 16-25.002(3) and assures future protection of public interest and achievement of public objectives to the same or a higher degree than would application of the zoning district regulations without approval of the application for receipt of the transferred development rights. (v)  A plan showing exact lot size, location and size of the buildings, structure or improvements to be placed on-site; the specific use of each building, structure, property, or part thereof; detailed arrangement of required parking spaces, location and means of ingress and egress; and, unless waived by the director, bureau of planning, topographic information. The same detailed information shall be required where existing structures are to be used or retained under the terms of this chapter. Plans shall be prepared, signed and sealed by a registered architect, engineer, landscape architect, registered with the State of Georgia, or planners who hold membership in the American Planning Association, competent in the preparation of detailed and accurate plans, drawn to scale. Said persons shall indicate on their plan their state registration number and shall certify that they are familiar with the City of Atlanta Zoning Ordinance, including revisions, and that to the best of their ability, these plans are accurate and comply with the general and district regulations of the zoning ordinance if the application for receipt of the transferred development rights were approved. (c)  Joint application by sending and receiving property: The owners of sending or receiving properties or properties in sending and receiving areas may apply jointly to have the severance of development rights in a sending property and the transfer to a receiving property approved in the same action of the governing body. The joint application shall contain all of the information required by both types of applications and shall be acted on as one application. (d)  Withdrawal or denial of applications: An application concerning a TDR special permit, including any applications for amendments, may not be withdrawn after advertisement for the public hearing at which it was to be considered. No fee refunds shall be given for the withdrawal of any application. Substantially the same application shall not be considered within 24 months from the date of withdrawal or denial. (e)  No transferable development rights affected by withdrawal or denial of an application. If an application for the severance, transfer or receipt of development rights is withdrawn or denied, the development rights at issue in the permit retain the characteristics, which they had prior to the withdrawal or denial of the application. (6)  Processing of the application. The council, after conformance with the requirements established in this section and in conformance with the procedures and requirements so established in Chapter 27, "Amendments," may authorize the severance or transfer of development rights and the receipt of development rights under the special permits authorized in this section. Where a special permit for the receipt of development rights increases the development of a parcel in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by the zoning district regulations, such development shall be allowed after approval of a special permit by the governing authority but only to the extent made necessary by the receipt of the development rights and in the manner specified in the special permit. (7)  Tracking of ownership of development rights. The bureau of planning is authorized and directed to develop a system for monitoring the severance, ownership, assignment and transfer of development rights. The records maintained by the bureau of planning shall be an official record of the City of Atlanta for purposes of the analysis of applications for the transfer of development rights. (8)  Purchase and resale of development rights. Development rights may be bought or sold by any person. It shall be the responsibility of private parties to such transaction to register the change in ownership with the Bureau of Planning within 30 days of the purchase. The failure of private entities to register the change in ownership resulting in applications, which differ from the records of the city shall be cause for denial of the application. (9)  Purchase of development rights by the city. The city is authorized to purchase development rights in the same manner as any other interest in real property and may hold the development rights for conservation purposes or for resale. (10)  Transferred development rights to remain with the receiving property; severance of unused TDR's after completion of development. After the use of transferred development rights are approved for a receiving property by a TDR special permit, the transferred development rights are appurtenant to the property and may be transferred as a part of any future sale of the property without further approval of the city, provided however that neither the use nor site plan approved as part of the TDR special permit allowing receipt of the transferable development rights may be substantially modified without amendment of the permit by the governing authority. (a)  Transferred development rights, not used on the property for which their receipt was authorized, cannot be severed or transferred without further action of the governing authority. After the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for all structures on the site plan approved as a part of the special permit, the development rights transferred to a property and not utilized in the manner described in the special permit may be severed or transferred from the receiving property by amendment of the special permit by the governing authority. (b)  Upon a written finding by the zoning administrator that the development of the receiving property in the manner provided by the amendment could or did occur without the use of all transferred development rights specified in the original special permit, the governing authority may, at the time of approval of an amendment to the special permit, provide that the amount of any transferred development rights not utilized, be severed from the receiving property. The governing authority shall make a finding as whether the development actually undertaken on the property has had no substantially adverse, environmental, economic or social impact that would not be present if the development had been completed as contemplated in the special permit and shall determine if the partial development of the property through the use of only some of the transferred development rights has allowed the development of structures which are at variance with the zoning district regulations such that the remaining property should be made available for development at the increased density allowed by the remaining transferred development rights. (11)  Expiration of transferable development rights special permits. If initial development of a property to which development rights have been transferred is not begun within 12 months, or a certificate of occupancy issued for all structures on the site plan within 24 months, after the issuance of the TDR special permit, the permit will automatically expire. The terms of a TDR special permit may extend these time limits but, any extensions not specifically stated must be approved by the governing authority. For the purposes of this section, the issuance of a building permit and construction activity with a cost of more than $5,000.00 are considered to constitute initial development. If for a period of 12 consecutive months, after the issuance of the first certificate of occupancy for the site, the property for which the receipt of development rights was permitted is used in a manner not specifically described in the permit, the special permit will automatically expire and conversion back to the use for which the special permit was issued will require renewal of the permit. (a)  A determination as to whether the "automatic expiration" of a permit has occurred shall be made by the zoning administrator, who shall notify the applicant of the decision in writing. The zoning administrator shall also notify the director of the bureau of buildings, that the permit has expired. The decision shall be reviewable in the same manner as other administrative decisions. (b)  Transferable development rights, which attached to a property prior to their expiration, cannot be revived for use on that same property except when authorized by a renewal of the special permit. If the application for the renewal of the special permit is denied prior to the initial development of any structures on the site, the development rights transferred to the property are severed without the need to show that the property would otherwise qualify as a sending property. As a part of any denial of the application for renewal at any other stage of development on the site prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy, the governing authority shall make a finding as whether the development actually undertaken on the property has had no substantially adverse, environmental, economic or social impact that would not be present if the development had been completed as contemplated in the special permit and shall determine if the partial development of the property through the use of only some of the transferred development rights has allowed the development of structures which are at variance with the zoning district regulations such that the remaining property should be made available for development at the increased density allowed by the remaining transferred development rights. (c)  No building permit for structures requiring the use of transferred development rights may be issued or allowed to remain in effect where the TDR special permit has expired. (12)  Future rezonings. Where any property containing a sending property is rezoned after development rights have been severed or transferred, the rezoning shall not act to restore any of the severed or transferred development rights. (Code 1977, § 16-28.023; Ord. No. 2003-95, § 1, 10-14-03; Ord. No. 2004-54, § 1, 8-2-04; Ord. No. 2017-72(17-O-1542), § 3, 11-29-17 ) 
Sec. 16-28.024. - Rail transportation communication facilities; collocation of private antennas on such facilities. (a)  A building permit is required for rail transportation communication facilities but no special administrative permit is required. (b)  Collocation of private antennas and other types of communications equipment is permitted on antenna or tower structures or as part of other rail transportation communication facilities and shall be allowed, provided that: (i)  The conditions set forth in section 16-25.002(3)(i)(iv)(k) are met; and (ii)  The collocation of the private antenna and any accessory equipment or structure may remain in place only so long as the exempt structure is used for rail transportation or rail line communications. (c)  Where collocation of private telecommunications antennas is intended on antennas or towers constructed or to be constructed as a part of a rail transportation communication facility, a special administrative permit for such collocation is not required provided the requirements of subsection (b) above have been met. Accessory equipment and structures necessary to support the private collocation shall be included as a part of the building permit applications. (d)  Rail transportation communication facilities for multiple sites and equipment configurations where collocation of private telecommunications antennas is intended may be analyzed and permitted as a part of a long-term development master plan permit agreements whereby the office of zoning and development may issue individual permits on an expedited basis for an individual site that was included in and is fully consistent with the terms of the master plan. Such agreements shall be processed in accordance with the time requirements of section 16-25.002(3)(i)(iv)(k). (Ord. No. 2007-58(07-O-1126), § 2, 10-8-07; Ord. No. 2019-09(18-O-1581), § 9.5, 1-31-19 ) 
Sec. 16-28.025. - Public art.     Public art is a visual, wholly noncommercial artistic expression intended and able to be viewed from a public way that meets the criteria specified herein. Public art meeting the following criteria may be conditionally located in any district. Consistent with the purpose and intent of this section, the Atlanta city council may, by ordinance, approve a work of public art. Said approval shall not be granted unless said ordinance contains the following three preliminary certifications: (1)  A certification from the director of the bureau of traffic and transportation or designee that the work will not constitute a traffic hazard or undue and dangerous distraction to motorists or pedestrians; (2)  A certification from the executive director of the urban design commission or designee that the work does not contain and is not intended to convey a commercial message primarily, provided that the name of a sponsor for said work may be displayed on an adjacent plaque or similar display that is no more than two square feet in area; and (3)  A certification from the director of the bureau of cultural affairs or designee that the work is not inconsistent with the City of Atlanta's public art program. The council, if provided with these certifications, shall approve, conditionally or otherwise, a work of public art upon finding that it does not negatively affect the public interest related to aesthetics, additional sign clutter, and public safety. In making this finding, the council shall consider the required certifications; the spatial relationship of the proposed art to the building or premises upon which it is located as well as the surrounding area; vehicular and pedestrian traffic safety; the existence of nearby signs; and the size, dimensions and other physical characteristics of the proposed work.

Sec. 16-28.026 - Enforcement of parking requirements for eating and drinking establishments that derive more than 60 percent of their gross income from the sale of malt beverages, wine and/or distilled spirits. (a)  Any eating and drinking establishment having a license for the on-premises consumption of malt beverages, wine and/or distilled spirits at the time of the passage of this ordinance, and which has otherwise satisfied the parking requirements in effect prior to its passage of this ordinance, shall not be required to provide additional parking if it derives more than 60 percent of its gross income from the sale of malt beverages, wine and/or distilled spirits. Where such use is abandoned, any new use at the location shall be required to meet all current parking requirements. (b)  Any eating and drinking establishment beginning operation after the passage of this ordinance providing required parking only for eating and drinking establishments and which derives more than 60 percent of its gross income from the sale of malt beverages, wine and/or distilled spirits and which does not provide the increased parking where required by the district zoning regulations shall be given 12 months after the issuance of a correction notice to provide the required parking at the increased level or being granted a special exception to reduce parking before further enforcement action may be taken. Such notice of correction shall be effective as to any persons who may take control or ownership of the establishment after the date that such notice is issued. (c)  The director of the bureau of buildings is authorized to request from the business license applicant of an eating and drinking establishment subject to the increased parking requirement for those establishments which derives more than 60 percent of its gross income from the sale of malt beverages, wine and/or distilled spirits, permission to access such documentation in the custody and control of the city as is necessary to establish whether the establishment provides the required amount of parking. The refusal to provide such permission shall not be a violation of this ordinance but the director shall find that the-establishment is to provide the number of parking spaces for those establishments, which derive more than 60 percent of its gross income from the sale of malt beverages, wine and/or distilled spirits. (Ord. No. 2005-41(06-O-0381), § 56, 7-12-05) 
Sec. 16-28.027. - Main floor level height limitation for single-family, two-family or duplex dwellings.     For new construction, the height of the main floor level of any new single-family, two-family or duplex structure shall be measured as the distance between the top of the sub-floor of said level and the grade as established by plans meeting the specifications required for soil erosion and sedimentation control by section 74-40 (as it may be amended) and shall be no higher than the greatest of the following: (a)  Four feet above the existing undisturbed grade of the lot as grade is determined shown in the manner required in this section; or (b)  Three feet above the average finished grade level at the property line adjacent to any right-of way(s); or (c)  Three feet above the street fronting main floor threshold level of an existing structure that is to be demolished for the construction of a new single-family, two-family or duplex dwelling. (Ord. No. 2007-48(07-O-0642), § 8, 8-23-07) Editor's note— Ord. No. 2007-48(07-O-0642), § 8, approved August 23, 2007, amended the Code by adding provisions designated as a new section 16-28.026.

No. 2008-67(08-O-0196), § 1, 7-21-08) 
Sec. 16-28.029. - Self-service bicycle rental facilities. (1)  Definitions. The words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning. The use of capitalized abbreviated reference terms for the definitions contained herein are intended to refer to the terms and phrases from which they were derived. (a)  Public-service bicycle rental service means a system managed by the city, and operated by others under a contract with the city, which provides the public with opportunities to rent bicycles from a network of stations at locations on public property including areas of the right-of-way, or private property. A person or entity meeting the definition of a public self-service bicycle rental service shall also be permitted to operate as a private self-service bicycle rental service. (b)  Private self-service bicycle rental service means a system operated by private entities, not under contract with the city, for the purpose of providing the general public with opportunities to rent bicycles from self-service bicycle rental stations that are operated as an accessory to a primary use and that meet the requirements set forth in this section. (c)  Public self-service bicycle rental station means a facility constructed as a part of a public self-service bicycle rental service where bicycles are made available for rental without employees or attendants being required to take payments from customers, rent bicycles to customers or receive bicycles from customers when the bicycles are returned from rental, which station may include a kiosk and storage. (d)  Private self-service bicycle rental station means a facility constructed as an accessory to the main use on private property by a private self-service bicycle rental service and where bicycles are made available for rental without employees or attendants being required to take payments from customers, rent bicycles to customers or receive bicycles from customer when the bicycles are returned from rental, which station may include a kiosk and storage. (e)  Self-service bicycle rental station ("station") is a term that includes both public self-service bicycle rental stations and private self-service bicycle rental stations. (f)  Self-service bicycle rental station kiosk ("kiosk") means a structure containing the self-service device by which self-service rental bicycles are rented or other permission is given for their use at a self-service bicycle rental station. For the purpose of these regulations, the front of the kiosk shall be considered the side or face of the kiosk where an individual operates the mechanisms for making payments or obtaining permission for rentals. (g)  Self-service bicycle rental storage ("storage") means that portion of a station that is utilized for the storage of rental bicycles available for rental or being returned after rental; provided that no part of any station may be used for the storage of rental bicycles that are inoperable or which cannot be rented within 24 hours after their return, for the servicing of rental bicycles, or for the storage of any other goods or materials. (h)  Bicycle rental service provider ("provider") is a term that includes those persons or entities responsible for providing public self-service bicycle rental services and/or those persons or entities providing private self-service bicycle rental service. (i)  Map or instruction board means a sign attached to or constructed as a part of a station for the purpose of wayfinding and/or providing instructions on the use of the station for the purpose of renting and operating of self-service rental bicycles. (j)  Kiosk information sign means a sign or display posted on the front side of kiosk for the purpose of providing 24-hour contact number where customers may make inquiries and may otherwise obtain information about the operation of the kiosk. (k)  Self-service rental bicycle ("rental bicycle") means, for the purpose of this section, a bicycle rented from public self-service bicycle rental stations or private self-service bicycle rental stations. (l)  Helmet vending machine means a structure for the self-service sale and or rental of bicycle helmets. For the purpose of these regulations, the front of the machine shall be considered the side or face of the machine where an individual operates the mechanisms for making payments. (m)  Interconnectivity agreement means a written agreement between providers whereby the terms of interconnectivity between the providers' stations are set forth. (n)  Interconnectivity means the ability for the customers of one provider to rent or return the rental bicycles of another provider at a station which belongs to either provider in a manner that supports the citywide bike share system. (o)  Citywide bike share system is an initiative by the city to implement certain of the recommendations as generally set forth in the Atlanta-Decatur Bike Share Feasibility Study in order to provide a non-traditional transit option to cover the "first and last mile" of a transit trip by encouraging and installing infrastructure that will allow access to rental bicycles and for other purposes. (2)  Where permitted. (a)  Public self-service bicycle rental stations may be located on any public right-of-way or city-owned property including public parks and city-owned recreation facilities under a contract with the city; provided however that the approval of the city shall at all times be required for installation and continued operation. (i)  A person operating in the city as a public self-service bicycle rental service shall be required to meet the requirements which apply to private self service bicycle rental stations. (ii)  Where city right-of-way is located in the R-1, R-2, R-3, R-3A, R-4, R-4A, R-4B, R-5 or PD-H zoning district, the right-of-way shall not be used for public self-service bicycle rental stations except where such right-of-way is on a street that is adjacent to a city park. (b)  Private self-service bicycle rental stations are permitted only as an accessory use to a primary use that is regularly open for business or occupancy and may be located in any zoning district except for R-1, R-2, R-3, R-3A, R-4, R-4A, R-4B R-5 or PD-H; provided however when any district, parcel or building is designated or is otherwise regulated by the historic preservation ordinance, the urban design commission's approval for the construction of the station as an accessory use to the designated property shall be required. (c)  Offices or repair facilities for providers may be staffed by employees but such use shall be permitted only as a primary use which is subject to the zoning of the parcel on which such use is located. A station may be located on the same parcel as an accessory to that permitted use. (3)  Minimum size for private bicycle rental service providers; interconnectivity agreements. access to stations and rental bicycles that allows the general public to have the ability to make one-way trips or reasonable round trips is a vital part of the bicycle sharing experience and distinguishes the bicycle sharing experience from renting bicycles from fixed single rental locations and is necessary to support the citywide bike share system. The public purpose of allowing the location of private self-service bicycle rental stations as an accessory use on private property is not enhanced or served when only a limited number of stations are available for the renting and return of a limited number of renal bicycles and does not support the implementation of the citywide bike share system. The negative impact on the bicycle sharing experience enjoyed by the general public which is caused by having a limited number of stations and a limited number of rental bicycles is best addressed by requiring that private self-service bicycle rental providers offer a minimum number of stations which are served by a sufficient number of rental bicycles. The public purpose of the bicycle sharing experience is also met by allowing, but not requiring, interconnectivity agreements among providers. (a)  Private self-service bicycle rental providers shall be required to offer access to a minimum of 50 stations and 500 rental bicycles before an application for a special administrative permit may be issued by the office of planning. (b)  Private self-service bicycle rental providers may meet the requirements of this subsection through interconnectivity with another provider that already has stations and rental bicycles permitted by the city, either as a public self-service bicycle rental provider or as a private self-service bicycle rental provider; however, in no event shall any provider be required to enter into an interconnectivity agreement with another provider or otherwise allow any other provider's equipment to interconnect or allow subscriptions to be interoperable with its own bike share system and equipment. Interconnectivity which brings the number of stations and rental bicycles in the city above the minimum number required in this subsection may be shown for the purpose of an application for special administrative permit by an interconnectivity agreement, affidavits and verification, all as set forth below. If the aggregate number of stations and rental bicycles between the parties to an interconnectivity agreement brings the number of stations and rental bicycles above that required by this subsection, the processing of the special administrative permit may proceed subject to the requirements of this section. (i)  An interconnectivity agreement submitted to the office of planning shall be accompanied by an affidavit from the applicant and from the other party to the interconnectivity agreement attesting to the truth of the statements set forth therein. The affidavit shall include, without limitation, the number of rental bicycles made available and the location of the stations which are necessary to meet the required minimum size for private bicycle rental service providers. (ii)  The interconnectivity provided in such agreements shall state, without limitation, that each provider to the agreement shall actually make its stations and rental bicycles available to customers of the other. (iii)  No interconnectivity agreement shall be recognized by the city for the purpose of allowing a provider to meet the minimum number of stations and rental bicycles set forth in this section unless actual interconnectivity exists and is proven to office of planning by a demonstration of interconnectivity between providers prior to the issuance of the special administrative permit. (iv)  Beyond verifying that interconnectivity for the required number of stations and rental bicycles shall be provided and maintained between the providers for the term of the interconnectivity agreement, neither the office of planning nor any other city office or department shall enforce the terms of interconnectivity agreement between the parties thereto. (c)  A failure of interconnectivity which reduces the access of the public to stations or rental bicycles below the minimum number of stations or rental bicycles below that which this section requires a provider to maintain shall not allow such provider to maintain operations of the nonconforming station or stations or make rental bicycles below the required number available for rental. Notwithstanding any other sections of Part 16 to the contrary no provider may maintain operations by use of stations of rental bicycles which are below the minimum number required by this subsection. (d)  The failure of a private self-service bicycle rental provider to provide the minimum number of stations or rental bicycles for more than 30 days shall cause the special administrative permit to be subject to revocation. Where a special administrative permit allowing a private self-service bicycle rental provider to operate its stations has been revoked, no operations shall be permitted at any stations operated by that provider and the kiosk and rental bicycles shall be removed. The provisions of Chapter 24 of Part 16 shall not operate to prevent a special administrative permit from being revoked or prevent a station from being subject to removal. (e)  A private self-service bicycle rental provider shall be required to equally disperse its stations throughout the city in locations that are accessible for residents in both high occupancy and low occupancy areas and high income and low income areas in the same manner as the public self-service bicycle rental provider. (4)  Permit procedures. (a)  All stations shall obtain a special administrative permit which shall evaluate its conformity to this section and to the Zoning Code. This review shall also evaluate the relationship of the kiosk, including the related signage, and the storage portion of the station to the site conditions as well as the adjacent sidewalks and streets and adjoining properties. (i)  No building permit shall be issued without an approved special administrative permit. (ii)  A site plan shall be required with the special administrative permit application. The site plan shall specify the height, footprint size and location of the kiosk as well as the size and location of the storage. All entrances and exits to the station shall be on the site plan. (b)  All stations shall obtain a building permit for construction in conformity with the City Code in the same manner as any other accessory structure as well as conformity to the criteria set forth in this section. (i)  As a part of the building permit application for a station, a sign permit application shall be submitted which details the size of each size and all sign copy to be displayed as well as an exemplar of the size of the signs to be displayed on the rental bicycles to be stored at the station. The permission to erect signs on a station shall be permission to store rental bicycles at the stations with signage which corresponds with the exemplar as to size. So long as the signs on the rental bicycles correspond to the size of the exemplar, the copy on the signs displayed on each of rental bicycles stored at the station need not be identical. (c)  In reviewing the application for the special administrative permit and/or the building permit, the reviewing agency shall be authorized to consider the City Code as well as all regulations set forth in this section, including without limitation, the criteria for self-service bicycle rental station design. (d)  The failure to meet the conditions of the special administrative permit or the Code shall be grounds for its revocation. No station may continue in operation and must be removed upon the exhaustion of any appeal permitted as a part of the process of revocation. (e)  No special administrative permit shall be issued to a private self-service bicycle rental provider unless such provider meets the same insurance requirements, bond requirements, service and operability requirements and other conditions that are required of any public self-service bicycle rental provider, as evidenced by the city's contract with such public self-service bicycle rental provider. Failure of any private self-service bicycle rental provider to continue to satisfy such requirements shall be grounds for revocation of the special administrative permit. (5)  Criteria for self-service bicycle rental station design. (a)  The maximum height of any part of a kiosk, including permitted signage, shall be eight feet and six inches as measured from the grade of nearest adjacent sidewalk. (b)  No kiosk shall occupy a footprint of more than eight square feet. (c)  No kiosk or storage shall be located on any part of a sidewalk which results in the sidewalk having less than a six-foot clear zone. (d)  Each kiosk shall display a kiosk information sign on its front side, at least than six inches by six inches but no greater than two feet by five feet, and which shall be at least two feet and six inches above ground level that identifies the station by address. Each such sign shall include a 24-hour contact number where customers may make inquiries and may otherwise include the name and logo of owner or manufacturer of the station, one station sponsor, and a provider number or code. These signs or displays may not be illuminated, and shall not include any flashing, moving, digital or electronic changeable copy features. (e)  Each kiosk shall be oriented and placed on the site of the station in a manner that directs its use toward users of the facility. (f)  When evaluating a site plan, the reviewing agency shall examine proximity to street intersections, pedestrian crosswalks driveways, and building entrances or exits in order to minimize conflicts with pedestrians and vehicular traffic. (g)  Any power sources must be depicted on the site plan and must meet all applicable electrical code standards. (h)  A station may be, but is not required to be, lit by free standing lights and/or light fixtures attached to the kiosk, provided however that such lighting shall be designed to reduce light spillage outside the station by directing the lighting internally downward or using shielded light fixtures. (i)  Storage for self-service rental bicycles shall not be permitted on any required parking spaces for a parcel or be permitted, but may be located on parking spaces that are in excess of the required parking spaces. Storage for self-service rental bicycles shall be permitted within required open or public space. (j)  A station may provide for reserved vehicle parking on the same parcel as the primary use but the parking remaining available for the primary use shall meet the required parking for that use. (k)  No station may be designed or installed in a manner that requires employees to operate it for the purpose of taking payments from customers, renting bicycles to customers or receiving bicycles returned from rental. (l)  A station may include up to two helmet vending machines. (6)  Signage on stations and rental bicycles. (a)  Purpose of the signage regulations. The findings, purposes and intent of Chapter 28A, as expressed in section 16-28A.003, are included by reference as supporting the limitations on such advertising. With respect to public self-service bicycle rental service, the city intends to defray or entirely avoid the cost of implementing the citywide bike share system and providing public self-service bicycle rental stations, or allow the public self-service bicycle rental service provider to defray or avoid such cost, by granting permission for signage for the purpose of sponsor identification. With respect to the signage on private self-service bicycle rental stations and the rental bicycles which may be located at such facilities allowing the incorporation of the name of the provider or its sponsor on the kiosk or the rental bicycles, such signage is considered to be a display on a device similar to vending machines, newspaper racks or telephone booths that is incidental to the provision of the service and shall not be considered to be general advertising. Likewise, the incorporation of place names or logos on the map and instruction boards is incidental to the instructional or wayfinding purpose and shall not be considered to be general advertising. Other than the permission granted in this section for incidental displays no advertising of any type is permitted on self-service bicycle rental stations or the rental bicycles stored at such stations. (i)  Based on the specialized purpose of permitting signage on stations and rental bicycles and notwithstanding any other provision of the Code of Ordinances, signs on stations and rental bicycles shall be allowed to display the type, size and number of signs permitted by this section. Unless a sign is specifically permitted by this section or the Code and any required permit has been obtained, it shall not be displayed at any station or on any rental bicycle. (ii)  Stations are a permitted accessory use and are not entitled to any separate business identification signage either for the bike share accessory use or for the primary use. (b)  Signage permitted at stations. (1)  Signage on kiosks. (i)  So that the users of rental bicycles may be able to identify among providers, each station may display the name of the provider operating such station and the name and/or logo of a single sponsor on each face of the self-service bicycle rental station kiosk. (ii)  The size of the display (either by attached signage on the kiosk or painted or otherwise represented on the body of the kiosk) shall be limited to 1,728 square inches on each face. These signs or displays may not be illuminated and shall not include any flashing, moving, digital or electronic changeable copy features; provided however that any screen used by an individual in the operation of the mechanisms for making payments or obtaining permission for rentals is exempt from this restriction but such screen shall not exceed nine by 12 inches. (2)  Map and instruction boards. (i)  So that the users of rental bicycles may be better able to plan their routes, stops at places of interest and places to return the rental bicycles and be instructed on the use of the stations and safety procedures, map or instruction boards and public announcements may be displayed on sides and rear of the kiosk stations in the manner provided in this section. No map or instruction board shall be internally illuminated and shall not include any flashing, moving, digital or electronic changeable copy features. Only one, two-sided map and instruction board map shall be displayed at any station. (A)  Instruction boards shall be no greater than 12 square feet and shall be for the purpose of describing the manner of operation of the station and the bicycles. Such instruction boards may contain the logo and/or business name only of the owner, managing agent, provider, the sole station sponsor, the station name, or manufacturer of the station provided that such display is not more than one-half of a square foot in area. (B)  Maps shall show other stations in the bike sharing system may display the configuration of streets in the city or other directional information. Maps shall be no greater than 12 square feet. A maximum of 20 percent of the map may be used for the display of the names, addresses and logos of businesses and attractions which appear on the map. A reference to the physical location of such commercial venture and attractions on the map shall be required for any name, address and logo to appear on the map. (3)  Bike racks. (i)  Each bike rack is permitted to have multiple copies of an identical sponsor display on any of its parts but this shall be the sole type of display that is permitted on a bike rack. Each individual displays shall be limited to a maximum size of 324 square inches. (c)  Signage on rental bicycles. Signage containing the name and/or logo of the provider or a station sponsor is permitted on the fender, luggage rack or basket, interior of the basket, handlebars, pedals, wheel rim tail light, or frame of rental bicycles stored on or rented from stations but no protruding or projecting component or appendage shall be attached to a rental bicycle for the purpose of providing a mounting surface for advertising. (d)  Signage on helmet vending machines. (i)  The name and logo of sponsors or the helmet manufacturer is permitted on the helmet vending machines. The helmet manufacturer display does not require a sponsorship agreement but it shall be limited in size to the same size as permitted sponsor displays. (ii)  The size of the sponsorship identification display (either by attachment to or as directly on the body of the helmet vending machine) shall be limited to 324 square inches on each face of the helmet vending machine. (iii)  No display on a helmet vending machine shall be illuminated and shall not include any flashing, moving, digital or electronic changeable copy features; provided however that any screen used by an individual in the operation of the mechanisms for making payments or obtaining helmets is exempt from this restriction but such screen shall not exceed nine by 12 inches. ( Ord.

Sec. 16-28.030. - Unified development plans.     The following rules apply in all zoning districts except R-1 through R-5, RLC, Planned Development Districts, and buildings, sites or districts designated pursuant to chapter 20 of part 16. (1)  Unified development plans are authorized by Special Administrative Permit (SAP) when one or more parcels of land is under common control. The required SAP for unified development plan shall only be used to demonstrate conformance with the provisions of this section. (2)  Unified development plans shall be used to establish conformance with side and rear setbacks, transitional yards, transitional height plains, lot coverage, on-site parking and loading, open space, and floor area ratio utilizing the entire area under common control. (3)  When a single unified development plan is located in two or more zoning districts, the portion of land in each district shall conform independently, except as otherwise provided for by the Zoning Ordinance or as follows: a.  Open space may be located anywhere in the area subject to the unified development plan. b.  On-site parking and loading may be located anywhere in the area subject to the unified development plan. (4)  Properties developed pursuant to an initial unified development plan approved under a single SAP may be subdivided into different ownership that can be acknowledged as separate parcels, even if any of the subdivided parcels would not meet all of the side and rear setbacks, transitional yards, transitional height plains, lot coverage, on-site parking and loading, open space, and floor area ratio requirements after the subdivision is completed provided that: a.  Any subdivision undertaken pursuant to this section shall be granted only if the amount of floor area existing or currently under development pursuant to a validly issued building permit meets the applicable requirements of the zoning district; b.  Where uses are limited to a particular amount of floor area by any condition of zoning or any SAP approval not required under this section, this section shall not be construed to require the Director to apportion the uses that may be undertaken on any individual parcel or reserve any amount of floor area that may be dedicated to a particular use for future development of other parcels unless an approved site plan shows specified uses attached to specific parcels; c.  The Director shall analyze uses permitted on any parcel in a unified development plan based on the mix of existing uses and noted requirements and the uses proposed in the SAP under review; and where any SAP is pending concerning a limiting amount of floor area allowed for a particular use, the amount of such floor area available shall be removed from that available area of the overall unified development plan as of the date of initial SAP application; d.  No properties developed under a unified development plan can be subdivided in a manner that prevents access to sufficient exits by occupants of any structure or prevents access to the entire parcel by police, fire and emergency service personnel, even where served by private streets; and e.  An owner of a subdivided parcel of a unified development plan shall be allowed to rebuild equal or lesser floor area of any structure which is located on that part of property in their ownership without permission of other owners holding other parcels in the unified development provided, however, that this authorization shall not allow the uses or requirements to be amended unless approved by the Director and all owners. (5)  Any changes from the approved unified development plan shall require a new or amended SAP, which shall be based on the same area of land as the initial approval. Where a single property owner no longer owns all parcels, the applicant shall obtain authorization from all property owners prior to permit submittal, with the exception of public streets deeded to the City of Atlanta. ( Ord.

Sec. 16-28A.001. - Title.     This chapter shall be known and may be referred to as the "Sign Ordinance of the City of Atlanta." ( Ord. No. 2015-54(15-O-1394), § 1(Att. A), 11-11-15 ) 
Sec. 16-28A.002. - Authority.     This chapter is enacted pursuant to the City of Atlanta's exclusive zoning and planning authority granted by the Constitution of the State of Georgia, including but not limited to article 9, section 2, paragraph 4, and article 9, section 2, paragraph 3, as well as authority granted by the General Assembly of the State of Georgia, including but not limited to O.C.G.A. section 36-70-3, the City of Atlanta Charter, sections 1-102(b) and 1-102(c)(16), (20), (21), (29), (41), and (42), as well as the general police powers of the City of Atlanta and other authority provided by federal, state and local laws applicable hereto. ( Ord. No. 2015-54(15-O-1394), § 1(Att. A), 11-11-15 ) 
Sec. 16-28A.003. - Findings, purpose and intent.     The City of Atlanta finds that the number, size, design characteristics, and locations of signs in the city directly affect the public health, safety, and welfare. The city finds that signs have become excessive, and that many signs are distracting and dangerous to motorists and pedestrians, are confusing to the public and do not relate to the premises on which they are located, and substantially detract from the beauty and appearance of the city. The city finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the following regulations. The purpose and intent of the governing authority of the City of Atlanta in enacting this chapter are as follows: (1)  To protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Atlanta, and to implement the policies and objectives of the comprehensive development plan of the City of Atlanta through the enactment of a comprehensive set of regulations governing signs in the City of Atlanta. (2)  To regulate the erection and placement of signs within the City of Atlanta in order to provide safe operating conditions for pedestrian and vehicular traffic without unnecessary and unsafe distractions to drivers or pedestrians. (3)  To preserve the value of property on which signs are located and from which signs may be viewed. (4)  To maintain an aesthetically attractive city in which signs are compatible with the use patterns of established zoning districts. (5)  To maintain for the city's residents, workers and visitors a safe and aesthetically attractive environment and to advance the aesthetic interests of the city. (6)  To maintain and maximize tree coverage within the city. (7)  To establish comprehensive sign regulations which effectively balance legitimate business and development needs with a safe and aesthetically attractive environment for residents, workers, and visitors to the city. (8)  To provide fair and reasonable opportunities for the identification of businesses which are located within the City of Atlanta, and to provide for the identification of the availability of products, goods or services which are available upon site so as to promote the economic vitality of businesses which are located within the City of Atlanta. (9)  To ensure the protection of free speech rights under the State and United States Constitutions within the City of Atlanta and in no event place restrictions that apply to any given sign dependent entirely on the communicative content of the sign. (10)  To establish a permit system to allow specific types of signs in zoning districts consistent with the uses, intent and aesthetic characteristics of those districts. (11)  To allow certain signs that are small, safe, unobtrusive and incidental to the principal use of the respective lots on which they are located, subject to the substantive requirements of this chapter but without a requirement for permits. (12)  To provide for temporary signs in limited circumstances, without regard to the communicative content of the sign. (13)  To place reasonable controls on nonconforming signs that are by definition contrary to the public health, safety and welfare while protecting the constitutional rights of the owners of said nonconforming signs. (14)  To continue to encourage the display of public art as a vital part of the urban landscape, while imposing reasonable restrictions on such art in order to protect public safety and to avoid the abuse of a public art exemption as a means for evading the purpose and effect of these sign regulations. (15)  To prohibit all signs not expressly authorized by this chapter, to provide for the maintenance of signs, and to provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter. (16)  To prohibit obscenity. ( Ord. No. 2015-54(15-O-1394), § 1(Att. A), 11-11-15 )

Sec. 16-28A.006. - Computations. (a)  Area of Sign Face and Distance Between Signs: All regulations involving the area of signs specified in this chapter 28A shall be interpreted to mean measurements of the sign face unless the context, text or usage clearly requires otherwise. All regulations involving distances from or between signs specified in this chapter 28A shall be interpreted to refer to any part of a sign, including both the sign structure and the sign face. (b)  Computation of Sign Area of Individual Signs: The area of a sign shall be the total area within the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together with the total area of any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets the regulations of Part 16 of the Code of Ordinances and is clearly incidental to the display itself. (c)  Computation of Area of Multifaced Signs: Where the sign faces of a double-faced sign are parallel or the interior angle formed by the faces is 60 degrees or less, only one display face shall be measured in computing sign area. If the two faces of a double-face sign are of unequal area, the area of the sign shall be the area of the larger sign face. In all other cases, the areas of all sign faces of a multifaced sign shall be added together to compute the area of the sign. (d)  Computation of Height of Sign: The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of (1) existing grade prior to construction, or (2) the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the lot, whichever is lower. ( Ord. No. 2015-54(15-O-1394), § 1(Att. A), 11-11-15 )

Said insurance policy shall not contain a deductible in excess of $1,000.00. The owner shall provide to the director a certificate of insurance that names the City of Atlanta as an additional named insured and that requires notice to the City of Atlanta at least 30 days prior to cancellation or termination.

The owner of such sign shall maintain said liability insurance for the life of the sign, and any sign not so insured by the owner shall automatically be deemed illegal as of the date of said insurance lapse and be immediately removed by the owner. In addition, the director, prior to issuance of a permit for such sign, shall require that the owner of such sign execute a statement appearing on the face of the permit or affixed thereto, agreeing to indemnify the city and holding the city harmless from any and all claims of any kind relating to said sign, which indemnification shall not be limited to the terms of liability insurance required herein. (f)  [Reserved.] (g)  Messages: Any sign allowed herein may contain any lawful message so long as said sign complies with the size, height, area and other requirements of this chapter and of Part 16 of the Code of Ordinances. (h)  Signs Not to Constitute Traffic Hazard: No animated flashing or changing sign shall be located adjacent to an interstate highway or be visible from any portion of said highway unless the sign is otherwise permitted by state law and complies with the following: (i)  Any sign which is directly or indirectly illuminated, including electronically changed signs, shall be reviewed by the director of the bureau of traffic and transportation prior to the issuance of a permit for compliance with this subsection (h). (ii)  No sign shall be erected, and there shall be no lighting of signs or premises in such a manner and location so as to obstruct the view of, or be confused with any authorized traffic signal, notice or control device, or with lights on any emergency vehicle, or so to create hazards or distractions to drivers because of direct or reflected natural or artificial light, flashing, intermittent or flickering lighting or real or apparent movement. (iii)  No flashing or animated sign shall extend over a public right-of-way. (iv)  If any sign is found to constitute a traffic hazard, the owner of the sign may be required to reduce the intensity of the condition or effect which caused the hazard to a level acceptable to the bureau of traffic and transportation. The director may through the issuance of a stop work order cause an immediate cessation of such conditions or effects where an imminent danger to the traveling public is found. (i)  Sign Lighting: Any sign erected subsequent to the effective date of this amendment shall, if externally lighted, be lighted from the top and the lighting shall be directed downward onto the sign. Lighting associated with a sign shall be directed at the sign face. All sources of light associated with a sign shall be effectively shielded from adjacent residential districts and streets.

In the event the sign district regulations do not set forth limitations on temporary signs, the following shall apply: (1)  In R-1, R-2, R-2A, R-2B, R-3, R-3A, R-4, R-4A, R-4B, R-5, PD-H, SPI-5, SPI-6, SPI-8, R-G, and MR districts, two unlighted temporary signs per lot shall be permitted, each not to exceed six square feet in sign area. (2)  In R-LC and O-I districts, two unlighted temporary signs per lot shall be permitted, each not to exceed 25 square feet in sign area. (3)  In remaining districts, two unlighted temporary signs per lot shall be permitted, each not to exceed 50 square feet in sign area. In R-LC through I-2 districts, two unlighted signs of the sign area specified in the applicable district are allowed for each 400 feet of street frontage or portion thereof, for each separate street on which the property faces. (4)  Where buildings are set back along the front or side street to a depth greater than ten feet, such sign shall not be placed closer than ten feet to the property line; where buildings have setbacks less than ten feet such sign may be placed on the building wall or within the zone between the building wall and the street. No such sign shall be erected within ten feet of an interior side lot line. (k)  [Reserved.] (l)  [Reserved.] (m)  Maximum Height of Signs: No portion of any sign shall extend above the top of the building upon which it is located. When attached to buildings over 30 feet in height, no portion of a sign shall be located more than 30 feet in height above ground level, provided that when the ground level is lower than the level of the adjoining street pavement, said sign may be raised so as to be not more than 20 feet above the level of the pavement. (n)  Protection of Trees: No removal, destruction, topping, pruning or cutting of any trunk, branch, roots or other vital section of any tree shall be allowed, whether or not such tree may interfere with the visibility of or otherwise affect a sign, without a permit obtained from the city arborist. In deciding whether or not to issue such permit, the city arborist shall consider the following factors: (1)  Conformance with the City of Atlanta tree ordinance. (2)  Whether the tree(s) involved are historic or specimen trees. (3)  The degree to which the proposed cutting or pruning is likely to damage the trees. (4)  The impact of the proposed cutting or pruning on Atlanta's urban forest environment. (o)  Location of Freestanding Signs: Freestanding signs shall be located ten or more feet from the nearest wall of a principal structure and shall not project over the roof of any structure. If a building existing on the date of adoption of this chapter is located in such a way that there is no place on its lot that is more than ten feet from a wall of the building, and if a freestanding sign would otherwise be permitted on such lot, then the director shall permit a freestanding sign to be located nearer than ten feet to the building provided that such sign is kept as far as practicable from the building, does not result in an unsafe condition, and otherwise complies with the requirements of this part. (p)  Building Signature Signs: Building signature signs where permitted by district regulations are subject to the following conditions unless otherwise modified by a more specific district regulation: (1)  Only one building signature sign shall be allowed on any side elevation of the building and further provided that no building shall contain more than one such sign per side elevation. (2)  Building signature signs may supersede the more restrictive height limit set forth in section 16-28A.007(m) including the 200 square foot area limitation imposed by the applicable zoning district. (3)  Building signature signs are allowed only on buildings four or more stories in height provided no part of such sign shall extend above the top of the building. (4)  The area of a building signature sign shall not exceed five percent of the area of the wall to which it is affixed, and shall not be included in computing the total area of signage imposed by each zoning district for other signs. (5)  Building signature signs shall be allowed only for an owner or principal occupant as defined in section 16-28A.004. Changes in ownership or occupancy that result in non-compliance with this chapter shall require the removal of the subject sign. (6)  [Reserved.] (7)  Building signature signs are subject to the prohibition against roof signs. Walls erected on the roof of a building regardless of whether such wall projects above its top are not parapet walls and no such wall may be used as a building signature sign or to support a building signature sign. (8)  An applicant seeking permission to erect a building signature sign shall provide notarized documentation that it has an ownership interest in the building or that it meets the conditions required to be considered a principal occupant and has permission from the owner to make the application. In determining the level of ownership necessary to qualify as an owner, the city presumes, based on the documentation required to be produced, that the applicant has made such arrangements with other claiming ownership interest as may be necessary to allow the applicant to claim that it may apply for the sign as an owner. As a part of the documentation, which may be, but is not required to be on a form supplied by the city, the applicant shall acknowledge and agree: (i)  That neither the city nor its administrative officials are confirming whether the application is in conflict with the rights of others claiming ownership rights or others claiming to be principal occupants regardless of whether such claims are known or unknown; (ii)  That the applicant has made the statements in the application subject to the state law penalties which apply to false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or entries in a matter within the jurisdiction of a department or agency of the government of a city; (iii)  That the city and its administrative officials are relying on the sworn statements in the application in making its determination that the application meets the criteria set forth in this chapter; (iv)  That the city and its administrative officials are authorized to audit the leases for a principal occupant to verify that the level of occupancy and length of the lease term meets the requirements of this chapter and that the applicant agrees to cooperate when requested to produce such documents. (9)  The issuance of a sign permit pursuant to this chapter is limited to a determination that the application included the required documentation, that the building on which the sign is to be erected met the requirements of this chapter and that the sign erected or to be erected met the requirements of this chapter. Those determinations are, in part, based on the notarized documentation provided by the applicant concerning the allocation of private rights subject to contracts and/or leases with other parties and therefore the city's issuance of such permit: (i)  Shall not be considered to be the decision of the city or any administrative official that such permit has the effect to determine, supersede, amend or modify private rights of ownership in any sign or in any building where such sign may be legally erected in that the city and its administrative officials are relying on the sworn representations of the applicant in issuing the permit; and (ii)  Shall not be considered to be the decision of the city or any administrative official that such permit has the effect to determine, supersede, amend or modify the private rights created in or by any lease or contract between any parties in that the city and its administrative officials are relying on the sworn representations of the applicant in issuing the permit; and (iii)  Shall not give standing to another party to request that the board of zoning adjustment determine whether ownership rights in the building or a contractual right or leasehold right gives such party the right to control the erection of or the content of the sign for which the permit was issued. While no building signature sign may be erected without a permit, the allocation of the right between private parties as to which party has the right to apply for and erect a permitted building signature sign on a building where such sign could otherwise be erected shall at all times be determined by the contractual, leasehold or ownership rights of the qualifying principal occupants and the owners, such that in the case of this type of dispute, the parties shall be obligated to settle such dispute between them in a court of competent jurisdiction in that the board of zoning adjustment is not empowered to make such determinations. (q)  Signs Inside of a Building: Notwithstanding the provisions of section 16-28A.008(2), certain signs inside of a building may require a permit to demonstrate that such signs conform with the district regulations where said signs function in a manner that is substantially equivalent to signs that would require a permit if placed on the outside of that building. Specific examples of signs that function in a manner that is substantially equivalent to signs placed on the outside of a building include the types of signs regulated by this subsection. However, a sign that is not specifically regulated by this subsection may still be considered to function in a manner that is substantially equivalent to a sign placed on the outside of a building. This section shall be considered authority to require that such sign apply for and receive a permit that complies with this chapter. (1)  Illuminated and changing signs may not exceed 30 percent of the area of any window or door where such sign is installed and shall be less than 12 square feet in total size regardless of the size of the window; provided however that no one sign shall exceed six square feet and further provided that where district regulations impose stricter controls on signs inside of a building or window signs, that the district regulations shall control. Illuminated or changing signs exceeding these limits shall not be considered signs inside of a building and require a permit. (2)  No sign installed in any enclosed space on a roof or rising above the level of a roof in that enclosed space shall be considered a sign inside of a building; provided however that where such signs are permitted by the district regulations they shall not be considered to be in conflict with this section. (3)  Window coverings of any type being used for the purpose of shielding interior construction activity or a vacant tenant space on the ground level of commercial or multi-family buildings shall be considered signs inside of a building and no permit shall be required and shall be subject to the following limitations: (i)  In R-G districts, signs posted inside of a building shall not exceed six square feet in surface area. (ii)  In R-LC and O-I districts or where the district regulations do not otherwise specify, signs posted inside of a building shall not exceed 25 square feet in surface area. (iii)  In C-1 through C-5 district signs posted inside of a building shall not exceed 50 square feet. (iv)  One sign of the size specified above is allowed for each 400 feet of street frontage or portion thereof, for each separate street on which the property faces, provided however that the posting of an exterior sign shall count against the square footage of signs allowed inside of a building. (r)  Temporary Signage During Construction: Temporary signage during construction shall be permitted as follows: (1)  In R-1 through R-5 and PD-H zoning districts. Unilluminated signs are permitted in single-family two-family and planned development-housing districts provided they are placed no earlier than the start of construction and removed within 30 days of issuance of a certificate of occupancy. Such signs shall be limited to one sign per dwelling not to exceed six square feet per contractor or subcontractor. (2)  All other zoning districts: In all other zoning districts, unilluminated signs are permitted provided they are placed no earlier than the start of construction and removed whenever a certificate of occupancy issued. Such signs shall be limited to one sign per job site not to exceed 16 square feet per contractor and six square feet per subcontractor. (3)  A temporary construction fence around an active construction site may be decorated with colors, graphics, symbols, writing, or other visual presentations. A temporary construction fence is permitted only if it is placed no earlier than the start of construction and removed whenever a certificate of occupancy is issued. (s)  General Clearance Requirements: No sign otherwise permitted in a particular district shall be allowed to project any closer than 18 inches from the inner curbline. All signs shall be so located and shall provide such vertical clearance as to provide for safe, convenient and unobstructed passage for pedestrians and vehicles. Above sidewalks or any other public pedestrian ways, vertical clearance to the lower portion of any canopy or marquee sign, projecting sign or wall sign, or freestanding sign shall be at least ten feet. Above parking areas and driveways other than for large trucks, such vertical clearance shall be a minimum of 14 feet. Above service and other driveways for large trucks, such vertical clearance shall be a minimum of 14 feet. Signs shall not be erected or maintained which obstruct any fire escape, any means of egress or ventilation, or prevent free passage from one part of a roof to any other part thereof; nor shall any sign be attached in any manner to a fire escape. (t)  Flags: In addition to the flags authorized under section 16-28A.008(4), one flag not exceeding 60 square feet in sign area may be flown on each lot within the following districts: R-LC; O-I; C-I through C-5; I-1; I-2; SPI-1; PD-MU; PD-OC; and PD-BP. Said flag shall not be counted in computing the number or total area of signs specified in the district regulations. Flags exceeding the size limits herein shall be permitted and counted as signs to the extent authorized under the applicable district regulations. (u)  Neon: Neon lighting shall be allowed only in the following districts: C-1 through C-5; PD-MU; PD-OC; I-1; I-2; SPI-1; Subareas 1 (Mill) and 5 (Transitional Commercial/Industrial) of LD-20A (Cabbagetown); Subareas 4 (Auburn Commercial Corridor) and 5 (Edgewood Commercial Corridor) of LD-20C (Martin Luther King, Jr. Landmark District); LD-20H (Hotel Row Landmark District); Subareas 2 (Transitional Commercial) and 3 (Transitional Industrial) of HD-201 (Adair Park); LD-20N (Castleberry Hill Landmark District). (v)  Additional Standards for Signs in Landmark and Historic Areas: In determining the appropriateness or location of new signs proposed to be placed within the boundaries of any landmark building and site, historic building and site or any property within a landmark district or historic district, the urban design commission shall apply the following criteria in addition to the applicable criteria for certificates of appropriateness specified in chapter 20 of this Part 16: (1)  The size, scale and design of the sign shall be compatible with the size, scale and design of the property, building or site upon which it is to be located. (2)  The sign's materials shall be compatible with the period and style of the property, building or site. (3)  The sign's location shall not obscure any significant architectural features of the building or site. (4)  The sign's installation shall not irreparably damage any cornice, ornament or similar architectural detail and shall be the least damaging method feasible for the property, building or site. (5)  The content of the message to be conveyed shall not be considered. (6)  Whenever in these regulations a certificate of appropriateness is required for a sign, the certificate shall be granted or denied within 30 days from the filing of the initial application. If the certificate is not granted or denied within that time period, the applicant may proceed as if the certificate had been granted. Provided, however, if the commission subsequently takes action on the certificate, the director is authorized to take the appropriate action necessary to cause the sign to come into compliance with that decision. (7)  Any appeal from any decision made on the issuance or denial of a certificate shall be granted or denied within 60 days of the initial filing of the appeal. If the appeal is not granted or denied within this time period, the applicant may proceed as if the appeal was decided in his favor. Provided, however, if action is subsequently taken on the appeal, the director is authorized to take the appropriate action necessary to cause the sign to come into compliance with that decision. (w)  Approved Historic Marker: An approved historic marker is a sign created through a program directly administered by a non-profit organization chartered for the purpose of research and education in Georgia history. All approved historic markers shall be freestanding, two-sided, cast aluminum markers of the same size, shape and height (including the support pole), as that marker previously used by the Parks, Recreation and Historic Sites Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in the State of Georgia historical marker program. An approved historic marker shall have a total plate size of 38" × 42" and a black background with text in silver. The lettering of the approved historic marker text shall be no more and no less than one inch in height and the text shall be the same on each side. Any seal of the sponsoring historic society shall be painted in the same color as the text and shall not exceed an area of 96 square inches. (x)  Regulations for Changing Signs and Signs Employing Changing Sign Technology: (1)  Each message displayed on any changing sign display shall remain static for at least ten seconds following the completion of its transition from the previous message. As used in this subsection "static" shall mean a display that is fixed in one position with no portion of the display being in motion or changing in color or light intensity. (2)  When a message is changed mechanically, the transition between a complete static display of the previous message and a complete static display of the next message shall be accomplished in three seconds or less. The transition period shall be measured as that period between any movement of any part of the display of the previous message and the time that the display of the next message is fully static. (3)  When a message is changed electronically, the transition between a complete static display of the previous message and a complete static display of the next message shall be accomplished in two seconds or less. The transition period shall be measured as that period between the time that the previous message is static and fully illuminated and the next message is static and fully illuminated. (4)  No changing sign may include animated, flashing, full-motion video or other intermittent elements. The transition period between two fully illuminated static messages displays in an electronically changed sign shall not be considered an intermittent element so long as the purpose of the changing light intensity is to fade or dissolve into the next message. (5)  No changing sign may have any type of changing effect on the border of the sign that is not fully integrated with a static message display and which does not transition to the next static message display in the same manner as the rest of the display. (6)  No display or other effect from any electronically changed sign shall cause a glare or other condition that impairs the vision of the driver of any motor vehicle or which otherwise interferes with the safe operation of a motor vehicle. Such display or effect shall be considered an acute traffic hazard and shall be subject to the regulations contained in this chapter. (7)  An electronically changed sign which uses the scrolling of letters, numbers or symbols onto the sign face to form words or messages shall be allowed to appear on the sign face from only one direction for each static display. Messages transitions achieved by means of the scrolling of the letters, numbers or symbols shall be completed within two seconds and shall remain static for at least ten seconds following the completion of the transition from the previous message. (8)  All signs shall appropriately adjust display brightness as ambient light levels change so that the brightness of the display does not cause a glare or other condition that impairs the vision of the driver of any motor vehicle or which otherwise interferes with the safe operation of a motor vehicle. The failure of an electronically changed sign to appropriately adjust display brightness as ambient light levels change shall be considered an acute traffic hazard and shall be subject to the regulations contained in this chapter. (9)  No malfunction of a changing sign shall cause a glare or other condition that impairs the vision of the driver of any motor vehicle or which otherwise interferes with the safe operation of a motor vehicle. Any such condition resulting from a malfunction shall be considered an acute traffic hazard and shall be subject to the regulations contained in this chapter. (10)  No billboard sign employing changing sign technology which is permitted by state law to be located on or adjacent to the interstate highway system or a billboard sign with a changing message sign face that is visible from an interstate highway shall be located within 5,000 feet of another billboard sign employing changing sign technology that is permitted adjacent to an interstate highway and on the same side of said interstate highway or any other billboard sign with a changing message sign face that is visible to traffic traveling in the same direction on said interstate highway. The distances shall be measured in a straight line from the nearest edges of the signs. (11)  No billboard sign employing changing sign technology which is adjacent to an arterial or connector street or with a message face that is visible from an arterial or connector street shall be located within 2,500 feet of another billboard sign employing changing sign technology that is on the same side of arterial or connector street or with a sign face that is visible to traffic traveling in the same direction on said arterial or connector street, as measured in a straight line from the nearest edges of the signs. (12)  A sign which is not permitted to be a changing sign and employing any changing sign technology shall contain only static messages and shall not be allowed to change more than once every 24 hours. (13)  [Reserved.] (14)  Any building which is allowed to have a building signature sign employing any changing sign technology may not change the sign more frequently than once every 24 hours. (15)  Shopping center signs may employ changing sign technology in those districts where changing signs are allowed. The portion of the sign face which is capable of employing changing sign technology shall be limited to 50 percent or less of the total area of the sign face. (16)  Permit applications for electronically changed signs must also include a certification from the owner or operator of the sign stating that the sign shall at all times be operated in accordance with this part and that the owner or operator shall provide proof of such conformance upon request of the director. (17)  Any billboard sign which applies to employ changing sign technology shall be required to include as a part of its application, a statement which shall indicate whether the applicant is willing to allow law enforcement agencies to utilize its display capabilities to disseminate emergency messages. (18)  Any changing sign currently in existence shall comply with the regulations of this part. If a changing sign currently in existence cannot meet these requirements due to the limitations of the technology being employed, the owner of the sign shall be allowed to continue the existing use upon a showing, satisfactory to the director, that the requirements of this part cannot be met. (19)  Large screen video display signs which are permitted in SPI-1 shall be regulated by the specific provisions applicable to that type of sign. (20)  Due to the limitation on distances between certain electronic changing signs, an approved application to employ changing sign technology must be acted upon within the time frames stated on the sign permit. After expiration of the permit, a new application for the location shall be required and the expired permit shall be not be considered to bar location of other changing signs due to distance requirements under this part. The director may issue one extension of 60 days for good cause as shown in writing by the permit holder. ( Ord. No. 2015-54(15-O-1394), § 1(Att. A), 11-11-15 )

An application by ADID seeking permission to erect a sign found by ADID to meet the criteria of the Sign Plan shall be approved by the director under this subsection even where the erection of such sign might otherwise be in conflict with regulations elsewhere in this Chapter provided that upon receipt of an application, the structural plans for the erection of the sign are deemed by the director to meet the applicable building codes through construction review by the Office of Buildings. l.  Construction Review by the Office of Buildings. Upon receipt of an application containing the items immediately below, from ADID for permission to erect a sign found by ADID as meeting the criteria of the Sign Plan, the director shall review only the structural plans for the erection of the sign described in the application to determine if the plans for the erection of the sign meet the applicable building codes.

If an application for encroachment is pending the fact that such permission is pending shall not prevent the director from receiving an application but no permit for erection shall be issued until a fully executed encroachment agreement approved by the Commissioner of the Department of Public Works has been received. 6.  All applications are to be reviewed by the office of traffic and transportation prior to the issuance of a permit to verify that no sign shall be erected or lit on a premises or location, in such a manner so as to obstruct the view of, or be confused with any authorized traffic signal, notice or control device, or with lights on any emergency vehicle, or so to create hazards or distractions to drivers because of direct or reflected natural or artificial light, flashing, intermittent or flickering lighting or real or apparent movement. i.  If the office of traffic and transportation determines that the sign will be a traffic hazard, the director shall deny the application; ii.  If any sign is found to constitute a traffic hazard after installation by the office of traffic and transportation, the director shall require the operator of the sign to either reduce the intensity of the condition or effect which causes the hazard to a level acceptable to the office of traffic and transportation or if no such reduction is possible, to remove the sign. iii.  The director may, through the issuance of a stop work order, cause an immediate cessation of such conditions or effects where an imminent danger to the traveling public is found. m.  Criteria for the Sign Plan. The Sign Plan, which is adopted as a part of the economic development purpose associated with these regulations, is developed based on criteria which are intended to allow flexibility in the development of signage in the district. 1.  The aesthetic and architectural compatibility of the proposed sign to the building upon which the sign is to be displayed or suspended; 2.  The use of the building mass and orientation in the placement of the sign so as to define and place strong visual emphasis on the street and other important public open spaces; 3.  Whether the sign will enliven building façades and avoid extensive blank walls that would detract from the visual interest and appearance of an active streetscape and unify a building's appearance so as to add to a street façade's interest, scale and three-dimensional quality; 4.  Whether the signage will direct attention to street level architecture and building uses in a manner that adds richness and variety to the pedestrian experience of the district; 5.  Whether the signage will assist buildings to display a clear pattern of openings and create shadow lines that enhance the street wall; 6.  Standard outdoor advertising billboard proportions of 14'x48' shall be rejected unless used as one component of a multiple sign array of varying proportions; 7.  Where signage is at street level, it should present dynamic, state-of-the-art façades with expressive lighting, audio-visual effects, and dimensional signage; 8.  Signs should appear as an integral part of the building design so as not to appear as an afterthought application; 9.  Whether the sign uses means of illumination such as neon tubes, fiber optics, incandescent lamps, LED's cathode ray tubes, shielded spotlights and wall wash fixtures so as to provide visual interest during nighttime hours is appropriate for placement of the sign when considering the safety of vehicular traffic and the impact on the residential uses that will be affected; 10.  The relationship of the scale and placement of the sign to the building or premises upon which it is to be displayed. n.  Cap on Sign Locations. Not more than twenty five (25) sign locations shall be authorized by this subsection at any one time within the district. This number is the cap. This cap does not limit the number of supplemental sign permits that may be issued, only the number of locations.

For purposes of this subsection, a sign location shall mean on the same building or parcel. o.  Annual Inspection of Signs. Sign permit owners shall provide an annual inspection report certified by a licensed engineer that the sign installed pursuant to this subsection is structurally sound and continues to meet the state minimum codes applicable at the time of sign erection. p.  Signs not to be visible from the Interstate. No supplemental sign permit shall issue, nor shall any supplemental sign be erected or maintained if the sign face of such sign is visible by drivers on the interstate highway. (56)  Briarcliff Plaza Landmark District.

An existing changing sign that is legally non-conforming shall be allowed to utilize this provision for purpose of installing a different changing sign technology. (b)  Permit Procedures: The following procedures shall govern the application for and issuance of all sign permits under this chapter 28A. (1)  All applications for sign permits shall be submitted to the director on an application form provided by the director.

Sec. 16-31.002. - Separability of provisions.     Should any section or provision of this part be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such decisions shall not affect the validity of the part as a whole or any part thereof other than the part so declared to be invalid. (Code 1977, § 16-31.002) 
CHAPTER 32. - NC NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICT REGULATIONS 
Sec. 16-32.001. - Authority.     This chapter is enacted pursuant to the city's exclusive zoning and planning authority granted by the Constitution of the State of Georgia, including but not limited to the article 9, section 2, paragraph 3 and article 9 section 2, paragraph 4, as well as authority granted by the General Assembly of the State of Georgia, including but not limited to O.C.G.A. § 36-70-3, the City of Atlanta Charter, §§ 3-061 through 3-603, and Charter Appendix IV, §§ 41, 42, 45, 48 and 70, as well as the general police powers of the city and such other authority as may be provided by applicable, state, federal and local laws.     The regulations set forth in this chapter, or set forth elsewhere in this part when referred to in this chapter, are regulations which are applicable in those parts of the city designated as NC Neighborhood Commercial district. The passage of an ordinance approving the classification of an area of the city for NC Neighborhood Commercial zoning shall supplant the zoning classifications applicable to the area so designated. (Ord. No. 2000-52, § 1, 9-26-00) 
Sec. 16-32.002. - Findings, purpose and intent.     The City of Atlanta finds that the size, scale and character of commercial uses directly affects the adjacent neighborhoods and the public health, safety and welfare. The city finds that highway-oriented retail, service, office and dining uses which are intended to serve larger areas of the city instead of a single neighborhood or small group of neighborhoods leads to development pressure on the existing, developing and revitalizing neighborhoods and on the developing or existing historical neighborhood commercial development patterns connected therewith. The city finds there is a need to protect existing and developing neighborhood oriented commercial areas and building forms from the incompatible uses resulting from intense highway-oriented development and to preserve and restore existing, traditional and pedestrian scale buildings in established, historic neighborhood commercial districts, as well as create new pedestrian oriented commercial nodes. The city finds that there is a substantial need to encourage a balanced mix of uses to include proportionately significant residential uses and to facilitate safe, attractive and convenient pedestrian circulation. The city finds that it is necessary to improve air quality by promoting walking and reducing the number of vehicular trips. The city finds that it is necessary to establish adequate parking requirements by encouraging shared parking arrangements. The city finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the following regulations. The purpose and intent of this chapter, in establishing the NC Neighborhood Commercial District, is as follows: 1.  Protect existing neighborhood-oriented commercial areas from uses and building forms which are incompatible with the scale, character and needs of the adjacent neighborhoods; 2.  Preserve and restore existing, traditional and pedestrian scale buildings in established, historic neighborhood commercial districts; 3.  Create new commercial nodes, in areas so indicated in the comprehensive development plan, which are pedestrian-oriented and provide uses which primarily serve adjacent neighborhoods; 4.  Promote a balance of retail, service, office, dining and residential uses which serve the adjacent neighborhoods; 5.  Place reasonable controls on the development of larger scale highway-oriented retail, service, office and dining uses which are intended to serve larger areas of the city than a single neighborhood or a small group of neighborhoods; 6.  Alleviate development pressure on existing neighborhoods by placing reasonable controls on development and expansion of strip commercial areas within neighborhoods; 7.  Facilitate safe, attractive and convenient pedestrian circulation and minimize conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles; 8.  Encourage pedestrian flow through the design of mixed-use buildings with sidewalk level retail uses, which open directly onto sidewalks adjacent to public streets; 9.  Improve pedestrian access within the district and to and from the surrounding neighborhoods; 10.  Establish building façade lines and sidewalk requirements, and reserve the space between buildings and the street for pedestrian functions; 11.  Encourage the rehabilitation or development of neighborhood commercial areas to include proportionately significant residential uses; 12.  Minimize the use of adjacent neighborhood streets for commercial area parking by establishing adequate parking requirements and encouraging shared parking arrangements; 13.  Promote a nodal form of neighborhood commercial development which is of such a size that all uses within the district are within a convenient walking distance of one another; and 14.  Include all parcels within a neighborhood commercial area as part of the Neighborhood Commercial District. (Ord. No. 2000-52, § 1, 9-26-00) 
Sec. 16-32.002A. - Size of neighborhood commercial districts; proximity to other neighborhood commercial districts.     The Neighborhood Commercial District shall have a maximum diameter of one-half mile and shall be located at least one-quarter mile from any other NC district except where such districts are separated by the street frontage of continuous residential zoning districts. The maximum diameter limitations shall be measured in the most direct line of travel on any street between the most distant property line of any two parcels in the NC district. The proximity to other neighborhoods shall be measured from any property line in an existing Neighborhood Commercial District to any property line in the NC district to be established by a direct line of travel on any street. (Ord. No. 2000-52, § 1, 9-26-00) 
Sec. 16-32.003. - Nominations, recommendations and legislation establishing boundaries; specific regulations for individual neighborhood commercial districts.     A Neighborhood Commercial District shall be created by an ordinance which shall be submitted for approval of the council after the completion of the procedures set forth in this chapter. (1)  Nominations. Nominations may be initiated by city council, the director of the bureau of planning (the "director") or a minimum of ten percent of the total number of properties within the proposed district subject to the approval of the director. Nominations by city council shall be in the form of a resolution requesting the director to prepare a recommendation. The nomination shall contain information and suggestions concerning the areas, buildings, and/or premises proposed for such regulations sufficient for the bureau of planning to prepare a recommendation. Nominations by property owner(s) shall be in the form of nomination applications to the director on forms provided for such purpose and shall be deemed to be complete at such time as all supporting required documentation has been provided. No recommendation on a nomination will proceed without a complete application. When an application is complete, the bureau of planning shall prepare a recommendation to the zoning committee of the city council. (2)  Recommendation by the bureau of planning. Recommendations concerning the establishment of a Neighborhood Commercial District shall be prepared by the bureau of planning for review. Favorable recommendations shall include an ordinance legislating creation of the district. Each favorable recommendation and associated ordinance shall identify the proposed zoning by the NC prefix and a number generated by the bureau of planning identifying the particular district, for example NC-1. The identification may also include language indicating the character or location of the district. Such ordinance shall proceed for city council consideration in the same manner as any other rezoning ordinance. The recommendation of the bureau of planning (the "recommendation") shall contain the following items which shall be transmitted to the zoning committee for its review. The recommendation shall be prepared only for the purpose of assisting in the evaluation of the NC ordinance and shall not become a part of the Neighborhood Commercial District chapter. a)  Comment on proposed district boundaries. The recommendation shall include a map or maps indicating: i.  The boundaries of the Neighborhood Commercial District and any subareas established within the district for purposes of Neighborhood Commercial regulations. ii.  The location and zoning designation of districts or portions of districts, if any, to be supplanted by Neighborhood Commercial zoning. b)  Alternative size and distance exception approval. Where necessary, the neighborhood commercial district maximum diameter of one-half mile may be increased. An increase may be authorized on a showing by the bureau of planning that the district size limitation would cause an otherwise suitable use to be excluded when it is located on a parcel which is only partially in the district if the one-half mile limit is imposed. c)  Staff report. Each recommendation submitted to the council shall include a narrative staff report stating whether the bureau of Planning supports the proposed nomination of the district for Neighborhood Commercial District designation, based upon whether the NC regulations are appropriate for the nominated area, and may include such additional information and suggestions on the area, buildings and premises under consideration. 3.  Contents of the district ordinance. Each ordinance creating a Neighborhood Commercial District shall contain the following: a)  District boundaries. The ordinance shall include a map or maps indicating: i.  The boundaries of the Neighborhood Commercial District and any subareas established within the district for purposes of Neighborhood Commercial regulations. ii.  The location and zoning designation of districts or portions of districts, if any, to be supplanted by Neighborhood Commercial zoning. Upon passage of the ordinance creating the Neighborhood Commercial District, the boundaries of the district shall be shown on the official zoning maps of the city which are incorporated and made a part of this chapter. b)  Statement of intent. Each Neighborhood Commercial District ordinance shall by this reference incorporate the statement of intent found in this chapter as well as any particularized statement of intent appropriate to the individual district being created. c)  Incorporation of general regulations. Each Neighborhood Commercial District shall specify that the general regulations found in this chapter are applicable to the district created. d)  Listing of specific regulations for an individual district, limited to e) below. e)  The following specific type of regulations may be established for any NC district and such regulations shall be contained in the district ordinance in the order listed below: i.  Maximum parking requirements may be established. ii.  Permitted principal uses and structures and permitted accessory uses and structures may be identified and omitted. iii.  Uses permissible by special permit may be identified and omitted. iv.  A specific use may be limited in number by limiting the total number of such specific use or the maximum ratio of such use to the total number of all businesses in the district. v.  Buildings may be limited in height, beginning at a distance of 300 feet from the nearest Single-Family Residential District. vi.  Maximum floor area of permitted uses may be reduced. vii.  Hours of operation of specific uses may be restricted. viii.  Minimum transitional side and rear yard widths may be reduced. ix.  Minimum block face lengths may be reduced. x.  Species of street trees may be specified. xi.  Sidewalk requirements and supplemental zone requirements may be varied to be in keeping with existing conditions, only on a block where 50 percent or more of the buildings were built before 1950 (See subsection 16-32.015(5), Relationship of building to street).     Any of the above regulations adopted for individual districts shall apply to such district as a whole. Subareas may be created within an individual district only for the purposes of varying sidewalk widths, supplemental zone widths and tree species from the district as a whole. Such subareas shall be a minimum size of an entire length of a street block face that lies within the district. (Ord. No. 2000-52, § 1, 9-26-00) 
Sec. 16-32.004. - Special administrative permit requirement for building permits; effect on other special permit requirements.     Except as provided below, no building permit in any Neighborhood Commercial District shall be issued unless and until it has been approved through the issuance of a special administrative permit under the requirements so specified in section 16-25.004, as meeting applicable requirements and intent as set forth for the district involved.     Where regulations may require the approval of a special administrative permit for other purposes so specified, processing by the director of the bureau of planning shall, without additional application, include consideration of other special administrative permits. Where such regulations require special exception or special use permit action, the special administrative permit for building permit purposes shall not be issued until the necessary approval has been obtained for special exception or special use permit. (Ord. No. 2000-52, § 1, 9-26-00) 
Sec. 16-32.004A. - Provisions for administrative variations from regulations.     As part of general action when plans require approval of a special administrative permit, the director of the bureau of planning may authorize variations from regulations generally applying based on written findings that either: 1.  A plan proposed by an applicant, while not strictly in accord with regulations applying generally within the district, satisfies the public purposes and intent, and provides public protection to an equivalent or greater degree; or 2.  In the particular circumstances of the case, strict application of a particular regulation or regulations is not necessary for the accomplishment of public purposes or the provision of public protection, at the time or in the future. Notation concerning the existence of such variation shall be made by written findings of SAP approval to be filed in the office of zoning and development as public record. Variances and special exceptions shall be required from the board of zoning adjustment (BZA) in cases such as minimum yards (not adjacent to the street), minimum transitional yards, transitional height planes, minimum open spaces, maximum building height, maximum fence height, minimum parking and loading requirements and signage limitations. ( Ord.

CHAPTER 33. - LW LIVE WORK DISTRICT REGULATIONS 
Sec. 16-33.001. - Authority.     The regulations set forth in this chapter, or set forth elsewhere in this part when referred to in this chapter, are the regulations for the Live Work district. These regulations shall supplant existing districts or portions of existing districts, except that all existing categories of historic protection designated pursuant to chapter 20 of Part 16 shall continue in full force and effect and said existing historic protection regulations shall be overlaid upon, and shall be imposed in addition to, the regulations set forth in this chapter. Whenever the following regulations are at variance with said existing historic protection regulations, the historic protection regulations shall apply. Whenever the following regulations conflict with provisions of Part 16 other than historic protection regulations, the more stringent regulation shall apply. (Ord. No. 2002-41, § 1, 5-28-02) 
Sec. 16-33.002. - Findings, purpose and intent.     The city finds that the size, scale and character of commercial uses directly affects the adjacent neighborhoods and the public health, safety and welfare. The city finds that highway-oriented retail, service, office and dining uses which are intended to serve larger areas of the city instead of a single neighborhood or small group of neighborhoods leads to development pressure on existing, developing and revitalizing neighborhoods, and on developing or existing historical neighborhood commercial development patterns connected associated with these neighborhoods. The city finds there is a need to protect existing and developing neighborhood areas from incompatible uses resulting from intense highway-oriented development, and from uses associated with the redesignation of properties from industrial areas to commercial and residential areas. The city finds that there is a substantial need to encourage a balanced mix of uses to include proportionately significant residential uses and to facilitate safe, attractive and convenient pedestrian circulation. The city finds that it is necessary to improve air quality by promoting walking and reducing the number of vehicular trips. The city finds that it is necessary to establish adequate parking requirements by encouraging shared parking arrangements. The city finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the following regulations. The purpose and intent of this chapter, in establishing the Live Work (LW) district, is as follows: 1.  Promote a balance of retail, service, office, dining and residential uses which serve the adjacent residential neighborhoods; 2.  Encourage the rehabilitation or development of underutilized industrial areas to include significant residential uses; 3.  Enhance the environmental and recreational amenities of railroad corridors through greenspace and landscaped buffers, pedestrian and bike connections and adjacent neighborhood parks. 4.  Provide opportunities for the creation of live/work housing units that allow for the operation of limited types of small business out of the home. 5.  Provide sufficient, safe and accessible open space for active and passive enjoyment by residents and workers; 6.  Improve the quality of air and water through provisions for the planting of trees, greenspace protection, bicycle parking and electric vehicle parking; 7.  Create a diversified city where people across the spectrum of age, income, ethnicity, and culture can live, work, shop, meet, and play; 8.  Improve the aesthetics of the built environment; 9.  Protect existing stable single-family neighborhoods from uses and building forms which are incompatible with their scale, character and needs; 10.  Create new mixed-use districts, in areas so indicated in the comprehensive development plan, which are pedestrian-oriented and have a balance of residential and commercial land uses; 11.  Prohibit the development of larger scale highway-oriented retail, service, office and dining uses which are intended to serve larger areas of the city than a single neighborhood or a small group of neighborhoods; 12.  Encourage a grid of connected streets to improve access and reduce congestion; 13.  Facilitate safe, attractive and convenient pedestrian circulation and minimize conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles; 14.  Encourage pedestrian flow through the design of buildings with sidewalk level uses, which open directly onto sidewalks adjacent to public streets; 15.  Improve pedestrian access within the district and to and from the surrounding neighborhoods; 16.  Establish building façade lines and sidewalk requirements, and reserve the space between buildings and the street for pedestrian functions; 17.  Minimize the use of streets in adjacent single-family neighborhoods for parking that serves commercial land uses by establishing adequate parking requirements and encouraging shared parking arrangements; and 18.  Provide a range of housing types and prices to meet different housing needs. (Ord. No. 2002-41, § 1, 5-28-02) 
Sec. 16-33.003. - Special administrative permit requirement for building permits—Effect on other special permit requirements.     Except as provided below, no building permit in any Live Work district shall be issued unless and until it has been approved through the issuance of a special administrative permit (SAP) under the requirements so specified in section 16-25.004, as meeting applicable requirements and intent as set forth for the district involved. A SAP application and seven copies each of a site plan, landscape plan and elevation drawings of each exterior façade shall be submitted, as applicable, and approved by the director of the bureau of planning prior to the issuance of a building permit, with an eighth copy to be mailed concurrently to the appropriate NPU chair or his/her designee for information purposes.     Where regulations may require the approval of a special administrative permit for other purposes so specified, processing by the director of the bureau of planning shall, without additional application, include consideration of other special administrative permits. Where such regulations require special exception or special use permit action, the special administrative permit for building permit purposes shall not be issued until the necessary approval has been obtained for special exception or special use permit. (Ord. No. 2002-41, § 1, 5-28-02) 
Sec. 16-33.003A. - Provisions for administrative variations from regulations.     As part of general action when plans require approval of a special administrative permit, the director of the bureau of planning may authorize variations from regulations generally applying based on written findings that either: 1.  A plan proposed by an applicant, while not strictly in accord with regulations applying generally within the district, satisfies the public purposes and intent, and provides public protection to an equivalent or greater degree; or 2.  In the particular circumstances of the case, strict application of a particular regulation or regulations is not necessary for the accomplishment of public purposes or the provision of public protection, at the time or in the future. Notation concerning the existence of such variation shall be made by written findings of SAP approval to be filed in the office of zoning and development as public record. Variances and special exceptions shall be required from the board of zoning adjustment (BZA) in cases such as minimum yards (not adjacent to the street), minimum transitional yards, transitional height planes, minimum open spaces, maximum building height, maximum fence height, minimum parking and loading requirements and signage limitations. ( Ord.

CHAPTER 34. - MRC MIXED RESIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL DISTRICT REGULATIONS 
Sec. 16-34.001. - Authority.     This chapter is enacted pursuant to the City of Atlanta's exclusive zoning and planning authority granted by the Constitution of the State of Georgia, including but not limited to the Article 9, Section 2, Paragraph 3 and Article 9 Section 2, Paragraph 4, as well as authority granted by the General Assembly of the State of Georgia, including but not limited to O.C.G.A. § 36-70-3, the City of Atlanta Charter, §§ 3-061 through 3-603, and Charter Appendix IV, §§ 41,42,45,48 and 70, as well as the general police powers of the City of Atlanta and such other authority as may be provided by applicable, state, federal and local laws.     The regulations set forth in this chapter, or set forth elsewhere in this part when referred to in this chapter, are regulations which are applicable in those parts of the city designated as MRC Mixed Residential Commercial district. The passage of an ordinance approving the classification of an area of the city for Mixed Residential Commercial zoning shall supplant the zoning classifications applicable to the area so designated. Whenever the following regulations are at variance with said existing historic protection regulations, the historic protection regulations shall apply. Whenever the following regulations conflict with provisions of part 16 other than historic protection regulations, the more stringent regulation shall apply. (Ord. No. 2002-40, § 1, 5-28-02) 
Sec. 16-34.002. - Findings, purpose and intent.     The city finds that the size, scale and character of commercial uses directly affect the adjacent neighborhood districts and the public health, safety and welfare. The city finds that highway-oriented retail, service, office and dining uses which are intended to serve larger areas of the city instead of a single neighborhood or small group of neighborhoods must be located on streets that are suited for this type of development and must be done in a manner which is compatible with the adjacent neighborhoods or group of neighborhoods. The city finds there is a need to protect existing and developing neighborhood areas and building forms from the incompatible uses resulting from intense highway-oriented development and to preserve and restore existing, traditional and pedestrian scale buildings in established, historic neighborhood districts, as well as create new pedestrian oriented commercial nodes. The city finds that there is a substantial need to encourage a balanced mix of uses to include proportionately significant residential uses and to facilitate safe, attractive and convenient pedestrian circulation. The city finds that it is necessary to improve air quality by promoting walking and reducing the number of vehicular trips. The city finds that it is necessary to establish adequate parking requirements by encouraging shared parking arrangements. The city finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the following regulations. The purpose and intent of this chapter, in establishing the Mixed Residential Commercial (MRC) district, is as follows: 1.  Create a diversified city where people across the spectrum of age, income, ethnicity, and culture can live, work, shop, meet, and play; 2.  Encourage infill and rehabilitation development within traditionally commercial areas that include proportionately significant residential uses; 3.  Encourage the development of multi-family housing within commercial areas; 4.  Alleviate development pressure on existing residential neighborhoods by placing reasonable controls on development and expansion of strip commercial areas within primarily single-family neighborhoods; 5.  Place reasonable controls on the development of larger scale highway-oriented retail, service, office and dining uses which are intended to serve larger areas of the city than a single neighborhood or a small group of neighborhoods; 6.  Improve the aesthetics of the built environment; 7.  Protect existing neighborhoods from uses and building forms which are incompatible with the scale, character and needs of the adjacent neighborhoods; 8.  Ensure pedestrian-oriented building forms; 9.  Provide for a pedestrian-oriented environment on streets and sidewalks; 10.  Promote public safety through the provision of pedestrian-oriented street-level uses, sufficient sidewalk widths, adequate visibility from adjacent buildings and primary pedestrian access from buildings to adjacent sidewalks; 11.  Ensure residents have convenient pedestrian access to nearby commercial uses; 12.  Provide stable single-family neighborhoods with nodal commercial areas which are such a size that all uses are within convenient walking distance of one another; 13.  Promote an appropriate balance and scale of commercial uses which meet the needs of nearby residents; 14.  Encourage a compatible mixture of residential, commercial, cultural and recreational uses; 15.  Provide a range of housing types and prices to meet different housing needs; 16.  Reserve the space between the building and the sidewalk for pedestrian related uses; 17.  Provide appropriately scaled, continuous pedestrian oriented uses and activities adjacent to sidewalks along streets with identified pedestrian needs; 18.  Encourage a grid of connected streets to improve access and reduce congestion; 19.  Facilitate safe, pleasant and convenient pedestrian circulation and minimize conflict between pedestrians and vehicles; 20.  Facilitate safe and convenient bicycle usage; 21.  Prevent encroachment of incompatible commercial uses and minimize commercial parking into residential neighborhoods; 22.  Provide sufficient parking in an unobtrusive manner; 23.  Reduce parking requirements by encouraging shared parking and alternative modes of transportation; 24.  Maximize opportunities for pedestrian amenities, including parks, plazas, greenways and public art; 25.  Provide sufficient, safe and accessible parks, plazas and greenways for active and passive enjoyment; 26.  Improve the quality of air and water through provisions for the planting of trees, greenspace protection, bicycle parking and electric vehicle parking. (Ord.

CHAPTER 35. - MR MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT REGULATIONS 
Sec. 16-35.001. - Authority.     This chapter is enacted pursuant to the City of Atlanta's exclusive zoning and planning authority granted by the Constitution of the State of Georgia, including but not limited to the Article 9, Section 2, Paragraph 3 and Article 9 Section 2, Paragraph 4, as well as authority granted by the General Assembly of the State of Georgia, including but not limited to O.C.G.A. § 36-70-3, the City of Atlanta Charter, §§ 3-061 through 3-603, and Charter Appendix IV, §§ 41, 42, 45, 48 and 70, as well as the general police powers of the City of Atlanta and such other authority as may be provided by applicable, state, federal and local laws.     The regulations set forth in this chapter, or set forth elsewhere in this part when referred to in this chapter, are regulations which are applicable in those parts of the city designated as Multi-family Residential (MR) district. The passage of an ordinance approving the classification of an area of the city for multi-family residential zoning shall supplant the zoning classifications applicable to the area so designated. Whenever the following regulations are at variance with said existing historic protection regulations, the historic protection regulations shall apply. Whenever the following regulations conflict with provisions of Part 16 other than historic protection regulations, the more stringent regulation shall apply. (Ord. No. 2002-39, § 1, 5-28-02) 
Sec. 16-35.002. - Findings, purpose and intent.     The City of Atlanta finds that the size, scale and character of multi-family residential uses directly affects adjacent land uses and the public health, safety and welfare. The city finds that internally focused, highway-oriented multi-family residential uses are incompatible with establishing a pedestrian infrastructure and are inconsistent with the needs of the city. The city finds there is a need to protect existing and developing pedestrian-oriented multi-family residential areas and building forms from the intrusion of incompatible building forms and to preserve and restore existing, traditional and pedestrian scale buildings in established, historic multi-family residential districts, as well as create new pedestrian oriented multi-family residential areas. The city finds that within these residential areas there is a substantial need to encourage a balanced mix of uses to include small accessory retail uses and to facilitate safe, attractive and convenient pedestrian circulation. The city finds that it is necessary to improve air quality by promoting walking and reducing the number of vehicular trips. The city finds that it is necessary to establish adequate parking requirements by encouraging shared parking arrangements. The city finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the following regulations. The purpose and intent of this chapter, in establishing the Multi-family Residential (MR) district, is as follows: 1.  Create a diversified city where people across the spectrum of age, income, ethnicity, and culture can live, work, shop, meet, and play; 2.  Provide for multi-family residential housing types that are compatible with single-family neighborhoods and commercial nodes; 3.  Encourage the development of multi-family housing, with limited neighborhood serving commercial uses; 4.  Encourage a range of housing types and prices to meet different housing needs; 5.  Improve the aesthetics of the built environment; 6.  Protect existing stable single-family neighborhoods from uses and building forms which are incompatible with their scale, character and needs; 7.  Ensure pedestrian-oriented building forms; 8.  Provide for a pedestrian-oriented environment on streets and sidewalks; 9.  Promote public safety through the provision of pedestrian-oriented street-level uses, sufficient sidewalk widths, adequate visibility from adjacent buildings and primary pedestrian access from buildings to adjacent sidewalks; 10.  Reserve the space between the building and the sidewalk for pedestrian related uses; 11.  Provide appropriately-scaled, continuous pedestrian oriented uses and activities adjacent to sidewalks along streets with identified pedestrian needs; 12.  Encourage a grid of connected streets to improve access and reduce congestion; 13.  Facilitate safe, pleasant and convenient pedestrian circulation and minimize conflict between pedestrians and vehicles; 14.  Facilitate safe and convenient bicycle usage; 15.  Provide sufficient parking in an unobtrusive manner; 16.  Maximize opportunities for pedestrian amenities, including parks, plazas, greenways and public art; 17.  Provide sufficient, safe and accessible parks, plazas and greenways for active and passive enjoyment; and 18.  Improve the quality of air and water through provisions for the planting of trees, greenspace protection, bicycle parking and electric vehicle parking. (Ord. No. 2002-39, § 1, 5-28-02) 
Sec. 16-35.003. - Districts established.     Nine MR districts are established, the intent of which is described below: 1.  MR-1. Primarily single-family dwellings which may have zero-lot-line along one side yard. 2.  MR-2. Two- to three-story multi-family dwellings. 3.  MR-3. Eight-story, zero-lot-line multi-family dwellings. 4.  MR-4A. Eight-story, multi-family dwellings. 5.  MR-4B. Five-story, zero-lot-line single-family dwellings. 6.  MR-5A. 15-story multi-family dwellings along major corridors. 7.  MR-5B. Multi-family dwellings with a maximum height of 15 stories with appropriate height controls adjacent to single-family neighborhoods. 8.  MR-6. 22-story multi-family dwellings along major corridors. 9.  MR-MU. Two- to three-story multi-unit buildings targeting "Missing Middle" housing needs. (Ord. No. 2002-39, § 1, 5-28-02; Ord. No. 2019-09(18-O-1581), § 6.A, 1-31-19 ) 
Sec. 16-35.004. - Special administrative permit requirement for building permits—Effect on other special permit requirements.     Except as provided below, no building permit in any multi-family residential district shall be issued unless and until it has been approved through the issuance of a special administrative permit (SAP) under the requirements so specified in section 16-25.004, as meeting applicable requirements and intent as set forth for the district involved. A SAP application and seven copies each of a site plan, landscape plan and elevation drawings of each exterior façade shall be submitted, as applicable, and approved by the director of the bureau of planning prior to the issuance of a building permit, with an eighth copy to be mailed concurrently to the appropriate NPU chair or his/her designee for information purposes.     Where regulations may require the approval of a special administrative permit for other purposes so specified, processing by the director of the bureau of planning shall, without additional application, include consideration of other special administrative permits. Where such regulations require special exception or special use permit action, the special administrative permit for building permit purposes shall not be issued until the necessary approval has been obtained for special exception or special use permit. (Ord. No. 2002-39, § 1, 5-28-02) 
Sec. 16-35.004A. - Provisions for administrative variations from regulations.     As part of general action when plans require approval of a special administrative permit, the director of the bureau of planning may authorize variations from regulations generally applying based on written findings that either: 1.  A plan proposed by an applicant, while not strictly in accord with regulations applying generally within the district, satisfies the public purposes and intent, and provides public protection to an equivalent or greater degree; or 2.  In the particular circumstances of the case, strict application of a particular regulation or regulations is not necessary for the accomplishment of public purposes or the provision of public protection, at the time or in the future. Notation concerning the existence of such variation shall be made by written findings of SAP approval to be filed in the office of zoning and development as public record. Variances and special exceptions shall be required from the board of zoning adjustment (BZA) in cases such as minimum yards (not adjacent to the street), minimum transitional yards, transitional height planes, minimum open spaces, maximum building height, maximum fence height, minimum or maximum (as applicable) parking and loading requirements, and signage limitations. ( Ord.

CHAPTER 36. - BELTLINE OVERLAY DISTRICT REGULATIONS 
Sec. 16-36.001. - Scope of regulations.     The scope of the regulations set forth in this chapter are the regulations in the BeltLine Overlay District. These regulations are as follows: 1.  The existing zoning map and underlying zoning regulations governing all properties within the BeltLine Overlay District shall remain in full force and effect. The regulations contained within this chapter shall be overlaid upon, and shall be imposed in addition to, said existing zoning regulations with the exception of existing lots of record that are zoned R-1 through R-5 or Special Public Interest District and not located immediately adjacent to the BeltLine Corridor. Except where it is otherwise explicitly provided, whenever the following overlay regulations are at variance with said existing underlying zoning regulations, the regulations of this chapter shall apply. 2.  Whenever the following regulations are at variance with historic district regulations of Part 16, Chapter 20, the more stringent regulations shall apply with the exception of regulations specific to the Beltline Corridor whereas not to impact designated historic structures or buildings. (Ord. No. 2007-09, § 1(Att. A), 2-28-07) 
Sec. 16-36.002. - Findings, purpose and intent.     The BeltLine is a major initiative to link green space, trails, transit and economic development in Atlanta serving as a catalyst for transformative growth and investment encircling the urban core of the city by invigorating an underutilized rail corridor and surrounding underutilized industrial properties to create a better connected, more diversified city where people across the spectrum of age, income, ethnicity, and culture can live, work, shop, meet, and play.     The BeltLine represents a unique opportunity: to enhance the quality of life in the city; preserve and revitalize existing neighborhoods; make greater mixed-use development feasible; strategically introduce or increase density and optimize resources in select locations; increase the affordable housing inventory; promote air quality; reduce auto dependency; and concurrently advance economic development through an increased tax base.     The city finds that taking special consideration to ensure that the redevelopment of properties adjacent to and within walking distance of the BeltLine Corridor entails a compatible mixture of residential, commercial, cultural and recreational uses, and design standards conceptualized in the BeltLine Redevelopment Plan is crucial to promote and ensure the public health, safety and welfare of its citizens. The city recognizes that as the BeltLine attracts new development, the orientation and character of that growth should encourage pedestrian and transit-oriented uses and activities designed to support an urban character to foster the most positive impact on affected communities. By establishing the BeltLine Overlay District, the city intends to institute a regulatory approach that anticipates, manages, and encourages quality BeltLine development opportunities and impacts. Therefore, policies to promote these objectives within the BeltLine Overlay Zoning area will serve to: 1.  Implement certain recommendations contained in the comprehensive study known as the BeltLine Redevelopment Plan as adopted by the City of Atlanta; 2.  Preserve a continuous corridor along the BeltLine route of sufficient dimension for the implementation of transit, multi-use trails and green space; 3.  Promote and maximize opportunities for safe and accessible green spaces, plazas, public art, and cultural and institutional buildings; 4.  Preserve opportunities for connecting trails reaching beyond the BeltLine to create a broad network of trails throughout the city; 5.  Encourage a grid of smaller blocks and connected streets to improve access to the BeltLine, reduce congestion, and further the urban character of the area; 6.  Preserve the historic physical character of the industrial districts along the BeltLine by promoting adaptive re-use of historic structures and encouraging new construction to be consistent with the size, scale and/or character of those buildings; 7.  Ensure that new construction is compatible with the character of existing established adjacent single-family neighborhoods; 8.  Create new mixed-use and commercial nodes at BeltLine station areas that are pedestrian and transit-oriented; 9.  Create a diversified urban environment where people can live, work, shop, meet and play; 10.  Promote public health and safety by providing a pedestrian-oriented environment that includes active street-level uses, sufficient sidewalk widths, and primary pedestrian access from sidewalks to adjacent building entrances; 11.  Promote development of a wide range of housing types appropriate to meet various housing needs and income levels; 12.  Facilitate safe, pleasant and convenient pedestrian and bicycle circulation and minimize conflict between pedestrians and alternative transit modes; 13.  Provide accessible and sufficient parking in an unobtrusive manner by encouraging shared parking solutions and minimizing commercial parking in residential neighborhoods; 14.  Maximize air and water quality, including that which supports tree planting, greenspace and watershed protection, and bicycle parking; 15.  Improve the aesthetics of street and built environments. (Ord. No. 2007-09, § 1(Att. A), 2-28-07) 
Sec. 16-36.003. - Boundaries.     The boundaries of the BeltLine Overlay District shall be as shown on the official zoning map Attachment B adopted herewith entitled "BeltLine Overlay District." Any future property in which any portion of said property is located within the boundary of the BeltLine Overlay District shall be subject to the full regulations set forth in this chapter. (Ord. No. 2007-09, § 1(Att. A), 2-28-07) 
Sec. 16-36.004. - Procedures. 1.  Rezoning—Pre-application: In addition to the current rezoning procedures, any applications for rezoning within the BeltLine Overlay District subject area will begin with a pre-application consultation between the applicant and the bureau of planning as set by the bureau of planning. 2.  Special administrative permit requirement and procedures: A special administrative permit (SAP) application and a specified number of copies of each site plan, landscape plan and elevation drawings of each exterior façade shall be submitted, as applicable, and approved by the director of the bureau of planning, under the requirements specified in section 16-25.004, prior to the issuance of a building permit. In addition to SAP submittal as specified above, the applicant shall also provide to the director of the bureau of planning a United States Postal Service certificate of mailing (first-class) of one copy of the full SAP application to the appropriate Neighborhood Planning Unit (NPU) chair or their designee for the purpose of notification and comment, and also a signed affidavit of said NPU notification. Said appropriate NPU shall have a period of 21 days from the date of the said certificate of mailing to provide one set of written comments to the bureau of planning prior to any SAP approval. All exterior demolition, new construction (including additions to existing buildings), expansions of outdoor dining or any construction which results in increased lot coverage, modification of the building footprint, or modification of building façades that alters the configuration of openings, shall be subject to said site plan and building elevation approval as part of the SAP. Any subdivisions, consolidations and replats shall conform to any proposed City of Atlanta future street plans in addition to the requirement of Part 15 of the City Code. When a conflict arises between Part 15 and this chapter, the requirements of this chapter shall apply. Where the proposed development may require one or more special administrative permits, processing by the director of the bureau of planning shall include consideration of such special administrative permits. Where underlying regulations require variance, special exception or special use permit action, the special administrative permit shall not be issued until the necessary approval has been obtained. 3.  Exemptions from the special administrative permit requirement: Existing lots of record that have an underlying zoning designation of R-1 through R-5 or Special Public Interest (SPI) and not located immediately adjacent to the BeltLine Corridor shall be used and constructed as is otherwise permitted pursuant to the provisions of Part 16 and shall not require the obtaining of a special administrative permit (SAP) except as required by the underlying zoning district. Any interior renovations or exterior repairs not explicitly set forth shall not require SAP approval. Said classes of special administrative permit applications may be exempted from detailed review requirements upon written findings that generally within these districts, the actions proposed are of such a character or of such a scale as to make detailed reviews and approval by the planning director unnecessary. Where applications for special administrative permits are determined by reference to such findings to be thus exempted, the permit shall be issued if otherwise lawful. (Ord. No. 2007-09, § 1(Att. A), 2-28-07) 
Sec. 16-36.005. - Provisions for administrative variations from regulations.     As part of general action when plans require approval of a special administrative permit, the director of the bureau of planning may authorize variations from regulations generally applying based on written findings that either: 1.  A plan proposed by an applicant, while not strictly in accord with regulations applying generally within the district, satisfies the public purposes and intent, and provides public protection to an equivalent or greater degree; or 2.  In the particular circumstances of the case, strict application of a particular regulation or regulations is not necessary for the accomplishment of public purposes or the provision of public protection, at the time or in the future. Notation concerning the existence of such variation shall be made by written findings of SAP approval to be filed in the office of the bureau of buildings as public record. Variances and special exceptions from underlying zoning regulations shall be required from the board of zoning adjustment (BZA) in cases such as minimum yards (not adjacent to the street), minimum transitional yards, minimum open spaces, maximum building height, maximum fence height, minimum parking and loading requirements and signage limitations among others. (Ord. No. 2007-09, § 1(Att. A), 2-28-07) 
Sec. 16-36.006. - Demolition of existing structures and redevelopment requirements.     Any structure 50 years or older shall not be demolished for the purpose of creating open space. All requests for demolition of buildings 50 years or older shall include concept plans for the redevelopment of the property that are sufficient to obtain an SAP for the development of the new structure.     Any property wherein 60 percent or greater of the principal building is removed or destroyed by any means shall be redeveloped in accordance with the requirements of this chapter notwithstanding any other provisions in Part 16, chapter 24 to the contrary, specifically including the installation of sidewalks and street trees. (Ord.

No. 2017-72(17-O-1542), § 1(Exh. A), 11-29-17 ) 
Sec. 16-36A.002. - Findings and statement of intent.     Providing a range of affordable housing choices for working persons in the BeltLine Overlay District is a difficult but vital objective. Housing shortages for persons of various income levels are detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare, causing detrimental transportation, environmental, business and social consequences. The purpose of this chapter is to increase the availability of housing choices for individuals and families earning at or below eighty percent (80%) of the area median income ("AMI") or at or below sixty percent (60%) of AMI as calculated and published annually by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") for the Atlanta - Sandy Springs - Marietta metropolitan area.     Therefore, policies to promote these objectives will serve to: 1.  Implement the goals, policies, and objectives contained in the City's Comprehensive Development Plan; 2.  Ensure diverse housing options continue to be available for persons and/or households at or below AMI; 3.  Maintain a balanced community by encouraging the finite supply of developable land to provide housing opportunities appropriate to meet various needs and income levels; 4.  Ensure the availability of housing with better access to jobs in the city and thereby promoting household economic mobility through increased access to MARTA and other public transit; 5.  Improve the opportunity for working people to elevate their economic status; 6.  Encourage the construction of affordable workforce housing by offering zoning incentives for the provision of affordable workforce housing as a portion of residential development to address both existing and anticipated future housing needs in the BeltLine Overlay District; 7.  Afford developers of residential development the flexibility to meet the broad objectives of the City's policies to assist in providing a percentage of affordable workforce housing units as a portion of development; and 8.  Provide opportunities to have on-site, privately produced, owned and managed, long-term affordable units. ( Ord. No. 2017-72(17-O-1542), § 1(Exh. A), 11-29-17 )

Sec. 16-37.002. - Findings and statement of intent.     Providing a range of affordable housing choices in the Westside Affordable Workforce Housing Overlay District is a difficult but vital objective. Housing shortages for persons of various income levels are detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare, causing detrimental transportation, environmental, business and social consequences. The purpose of this chapter is to increase the availability of housing choices for individuals and families earning at or below 60 percent or at or below 80 percent of the area median income ("AMI") as calculated and published annually by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for the Atlanta - Sandy Springs - Marietta metropolitan area.     Therefore, City policies that promote these objectives will serve to: 1.  Implement the goals, policies, and objectives contained in the City's Comprehensive Development Plan; 2.  Ensure diverse housing options continue to be available for persons and/or households at or below AMI; 3.  Maintain a balanced community by encouraging the finite supply of developable land to provide housing opportunities appropriate to meet various needs and income levels; 4.  Ensure the availability of housing with better access to jobs in the city and thereby promoting household economic mobility through increased access to MARTA and other public transit; 5.  Improve the opportunity for working people to elevate their economic status; 6.  Encourage the construction of affordable workforce housing by offering zoning incentives for the provision of affordable workforce housing as a portion of residential development to address both existing and anticipated future housing needs in the Westside Affordable Workforce Housing Overlay District; 7.  Afford developers of residential development the flexibility to meet the broad objectives of the City's policies to assist in providing a percentage of affordable workforce housing units as a portion of development; and 8.  Provide opportunities to have on-site, privately produced, owned and managed, long-term affordable units. ( Ord.

Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the city from requiring a developer to construct reasonable project improvements in connection with a development project. (e)  Phasing of Fees. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, transportation impact fees shall become effective upon adoption and approval of this chapter. Parks and recreation impact fees and public safety impact fees shall become effective on July 1, 1993. (Code 1977, § 19-1007) State Law reference— Authority to impose impact fee, O.C.G.A. § 36-71-3; impact fee adoption procedures, O.C.G.A. §§ 36-71-5, 36-71-6. 
Sec. 19-1008. - Requirements for assessment and calculation of impact fees—Generally. (a)  Time of Assessment. All development impact fees shall be assessed as a part of the building permit application process. (b)  Basis of Calculation. Any development impact fee imposed pursuant to this chapter shall not exceed a project's proportionate share of the cost of system improvements, shall be calculated on the basis of the establishment of service areas, and shall be calculated on the basis of levels of service for public facilities that are the same for existing development as for new growth and development. (c)  Certification of Fee. Any person who, after the effective date of this chapter, intends to engage in development may request a certification of fee from the director by submitting plans for the development to the director. The fee so certified by the director shall be based upon submitted development plans and shall be binding upon the parties as to the fee to be assessed for such development for a period of 180 days from the date of certification. Any change in the proposed development plan that in any way effects said fee calculation shall void the certification of the fee. (d)  Construction/Dedication in Lieu of Fee. In lieu of all or part of a development impact fee, the city may accept an offer from a developer to construct improvements or to contribute or dedicate land or money as provided in section 19-1014 of this chapter. Any such offer must comply with the requirements of section 19-1014 of this chapter. The "in lieu" portion of any development impact fee represented by construction of improvements shall be deemed paid when the construction is completed and accepted by the city for maintenance or when the person claiming such credit posts security for the cost of such construction as provided in section 19-1014(a)(3) of this chapter. The "in lieu" portion of a development impact fee represented by land dedication shall be deemed paid when the title to said land has been accepted by the city. (e)  Recoupment of Excess Capacity. In addition to the cost of new or expanded system improvements needed to serve new development, the cost basis of a development impact fee shall also include the proportionate cost of existing system improvements, but only to the extent that such public facilities have excess capacity and new development as well as existing development will be served by such facilities. (f)  Effect of Multiple Buildings. When development for which an application for a building permit has been made includes two (2) or more buildings, structures or other land uses in any combination, including two (2) or more uses within a building or structure, the total development impact fee shall be the sum of the fees for each and every building, structure, or use, including each and every use within a building or structure. (g)  Specification of Land Use. In the event that a building permit application proposes a use that does not directly match an existing land use type upon which fees are based, the director shall assign the proposed use to the existing land use type that most closely resembles the proposed use. (h)  Actual Cost Recovery Only. Development impact fees shall be based on actual system improvement costs or reasonable estimates of such costs.     When a change of use, redevelopment, or modification of an existing use or building requires the issuance of a building permit, the development impact fee shall be based on the difference between the impact fee calculated for the previous use and the impact fee calculated for the proposed use. Should a redevelopment or modification of an existing use or building that requires the issuance of a building permit but does not involve a change in use result in a net increase in gross floor area, the development impact fee shall be based on said net increase. Should a change of use, redevelopment, or modification of an existing use or building result in a net decrease in gross floor area or calculated impact fee, no refund or credit for past development impact fees paid shall be made or created. (Code 1977, § 19-1008) State Law reference— Calculation of impact fees, O.C.G.A. § 36-71-4.

Transportation impact fees set forth in the schedule provided in paragraph (2) below have been calculated using the following formula: Formulate to Calculate Net Impact Cost per Unit of Development: Net impact cost = Local impact cost - Property tax credit Local impact cost = Travel demand × Local impact cost/VMT Travel demand = 1-way PM peak hour trips × New trips factor × trip length Local impact cost/VMT = Total Impact cost/VMT × local share cost Total impact cost/VMT = Capital cost/VMC divided by VMT/VMC ratio Property tax credit = Market value × property tax credit rate  Where: Capital cost/VMC is the average capital cost to construct an additional vehicle-mile of capacity at LOS D; it has been calculated to be $1,495. VMT/VMC ratio is the adopted level of service, defined as the system-wide ratio of vehicle-miles of travel to vehicle-miles of capacity; the adopted ratio is three-fourths (0.75). Local share cost is the share of anticipated local funding to finance roadway system improvement in the 15-year capital improvement program; calculated to be 57.9 percent.     The terms used in this paragraph (1) are further described in the impact fee study. (2)  Transportation impact fee schedule. Unless an independent fee determination is requested in accordance with section 19-1012, the transportation impact fee shall be determined by the schedule attached hereto as Attachment 1A, "Transportation impact fee schedule," which by this reference is incorporated herein: a.  The fee shown in Attachment 1A, "Transportation impact fee schedule," shall be reduced by 50 percent to reflect increased transit usage and reduced travel demand in the vicinity of MARTA stations. This fee reduction shall apply only to projects within 1,000 feet of a MARTA station, measured from property line to property line along a legal and practical pedestrian route. b.  References in the transportation impact fee schedule to square feet refer to gross floor area, as defined herein. c.  If a building permit is requested for a building with mixed land use types, the transportation impact fee shall be determined according to the transportation impact fee schedule by apportioning the gross floor area committed to each land use type specified in the schedule. d.  If the type of development for which a building permit is applied is not specified in the fee schedule, the director shall use the fee applicable to the most nearly comparable type of land use on the fee schedule. If the director determines that there is no comparable type of land use on the fee schedule, the director shall use the formula set forth in subsection 19-1009(c)(1) above and appropriate travel demand factors (average daily trips, one-way, average trip length and new trips factors) derived from the Institute of Transportation engineers trip generation manual, reports appearing in the Institute of Transportation Engineers Journal, or other reliable sources. e.  If the transportation impact fee has been calculated and paid based on error or misrepresentation, it shall be recalculated. If the original calculation resulted in a fee that was too high, the difference shall be refunded to the feepayor. If additional development impact fees are owed, no permits of any type shall be issued by the city for the building or use in question, or for any other part of a development project of which the building or use in question is a part, while the fees remain unpaid and the director may bring any action permitted by law or equity to collect unpaid fees, including but not limited to revocation of building permits and/or certificates of occupancy. (Code 1977, § 19-1009)

Parks and recreation impact fees under this chapter shall be calculated using the following formula, as more fully described in the impact fee study: Functional population per unit × 0.00575 acres per functional population × capital cost per acre × discount factor = Development impact fee; where the discount factor shall be 0.50 for all service areas. (d)  Parks and Recreation Impact Fee Schedule. Unless an independent fee determination is requested in accordance with section 19-1012, the parks and recreation impact fee shall be determined by the schedule attached hereto as Attachment 1B, "Parks and Recreation Impact Fee Schedule," which by this reference is incorporated herein.     If a building permit is requested for a building with mixed land use types, the parks and recreation impact fee shall be determined according to the parks and recreation impact fee schedule by apportioning the gross floor area committed to each land use type specified in the schedule.     If the type of development for which a building permit is applied is not specified in the fee schedule, the director shall use the fee applicable to the most nearly comparable type of land use on the fee schedule. If the director determines that there is no comparable type of land use on the fee schedule, the director shall use the formula set forth in subsection 19-1010(c) above.     If the parks and recreation impact fee has been calculated and paid based on error or misrepresentation, it shall be recalculated. If the original calculation resulted in a fee that was too high, the difference shall be refunded to the feepayor. If additional development impact fees are owed, no permits of any type shall be issued by the city for the building or use in question, or for any other part of a development project of which the building or use in question is a part, while the fees remain unpaid, and the director may bring any action permitted by law or equity to collect unpaid fees, including but not limited to revocation of building permits and/or certificates of occupancy. (Code 1977, § 19-1010) 
Sec. 19-1011. - Imposition of public safety impact fees. (a)  Declaration of Service Area and Level of Service. (1)  The service area for fire/EMS facilities and police facilities with respect to which public safety impact fees are assessed pursuant to this section 19-1011 is hereby declared to be the entire territory included within the corporate limits of the city as such area is identified in the impact fee study. (2)  The level of service for fire/EMS facilities is hereby declared to be equal to 470 square feet of fire station area per 1,000 functional population. The level of service for police facilities is hereby declared to be equal to 660 square feet of building area per 1,000 functional population, as described and calculated in the impact fee study. (b)  Applicability of Fee. (1)  Any person who after the effective date engages in development within the service area identified in subsection 19-1011(a) above shall pay a public safety impact fee in the manner provided in this chapter. (2)  No building permit for any development requiring payment of a public safety impact fee pursuant to this chapter shall be issued by the city unless and until the public safety impact fee has been paid. (c)  Fee Formula. Public safety impact fees under this chapter shall be calculated using the following formula: Functional population per unit × Level of service (square feet per functional population) × Capital cost per square foot = Development impact fee; as described more fully in the impact fee study. (d)  Public Safety Impact Fee Schedule: Unless an independent fee determination is requested in accordance with section 19-1012, the public safety impact fees shall be determined by the schedules attached hereto as Attachment 1D, "Fire/EMS impact fee schedule" and Attachment 1E, "Police impact fee schedule," both of which by this reference are incorporated herein.     If a building permit is requested for a building with mixed land use types, the public safety impact fee shall be determined according to the public safety impact fee schedule by apportioning the gross floor area committed to each land use type in the schedule.     If the type of development for which a building permit is applied is not specified in the fee schedule, the director shall use the fee applicable to the most nearly comparable type of land use on the fee schedule. If the director determines that there is no comparable type of land use on the fee schedule, the director shall use the formula set forth in subsection 19-1011(c) above.     If the public safety impact fee has been calculated and paid based on error or misrepresentation, it shall be recalculated. If the original calculation resulted in a fee that was too high, the difference shall be refunded to the feepayor. If additional development impact fees are owed, no permits of any type shall be issued by the city for the building or use in question, or for any other part of a development project of which the building or use in question is a part, while the fees remain unpaid, and the director may bring any action permitted by law or equity to collect unpaid fees, including but not limited to revocation of building permits and/or certificates of occupancy. (Code 1977, § 19-1011) 
Sec. 19-1012. - Independent fee determinations.     Independent fee determinations of development impact fees may be established as follows:     At their option, applicants for development approval may petition the director or his designee for independent fee determinations of development impact fees due for their project.     Independent Fee Study. If a feepayor opts not to have the development impact fee determined according to the applicable schedules, then the feepayor shall prepare and submit to the director an independent fee study for the development for which a building permit is sought. (1)  The independent fee study with respect to transportation impact fees shall include documentation of the travel demand characteristics (average daily trips, average trip length and new trips factors) for the proposed use. This documentation shall be according to the prescribed methodology and format established by the director. (2)  The independent fee study may also include documentation of the estimated assessed property value of the development for the purpose of determining appropriate property tax credits. However, if the independent fee study does address assessed property value, the accompanying study of travel demand characteristics shall be based on a survey of projects of comparable property value. (3)  The director shall determine the appropriate development impact fee based on the results of the independent fee study and the applicable development impact fee formula established in the chapter. (4)  All independent fee assessments shall be presented for review and claimed at the time of application for a building permit. Any request not so made shall be deemed waived. (5)  Where the director approves the independent fee assessment, the fee so established shall be binding upon the feepayor and all successors in interest to said feepayor. (6)  Upon request for an independent fee determination, a nonprofit educational facility may be constructed, redeveloped, or modified solely for educational uses without payment of development impact fees provided the independent fee study submitted with said request demonstrates that said construction, redevelopment or modification will produce no net increase in that school system's total student enrollment.     Nature and Source of Data. Each independent fee study shall: (1)  Be based on relevant and credible information from an accepted standard source of engineering and/or planning data, or be based on actual, relevant, and credible studies or surveys of facility demand conducted in the Atlanta metropolitan statistical area by qualified professionals in the respective fields and shall follow accepted professional practices and methodologies; and (2)  Comply in all respects with the requirements of this chapter and be organized in a manner that will allow the director to readily ascertain said compliance; and (3)  Comply with all other written specifications as may be required by the director from time to time.     Certification of Fee. Any development impact fee calculated in accordance with this section 19-1012 and approved and certified by the director shall be valid for 180 days following the date of certification. Following such period, a new application for an independent fee assessment must be made. Any change in the submitted development plan that in any way effects said fee calculation shall void the certification of the fee. (Code 1977, § 19-1012) 
Sec. 19-1013. - Accounting for fees. (a)  Accounting for Fees. All development impact fee proceeds collected pursuant to this chapter shall be accounted for and invested as directed by the chief financial officer of the City of Atlanta. Restrictions on the investment of such funds shall be the same that apply to investment of all city funds generally. (b)  Separate Accounting Required. Separate accounting records shall be maintained for each service category of impact fees within each service area wherein development impact fees are collected. (c)  Investment Earnings. Investment earnings derived from invested development impact fees shall be subject to all restrictions placed on the use of development impact fees under this chapter and under the Act. (d)  Expenditures. (1)  Expenditure of development impact fees shall be made only for the category of system improvements within the service area for which the development impact fee was assessed and collected. (2)  Except as provided in subsection 19-1013(d)(4) and subsection 19-1013(e) of this section 19-1013, development impact fees shall not be expended for any purpose that does not involve building or expanding system improvements that create additional capacity available to serve new growth and development. Funds shall be expended in the order in which they are collected. (3)  No funds shall be used for periodic or routine maintenance or for any purpose not in accordance with the requirements of section 36-71-8 of the Act. (4)  Except as set forth in this section 19-1013, development impact fees collected by the city to recover the cost of excess capacity in existing system improvements may be spent only on the same category of public improvements and within the service area in which they were collected. (e)  Expenses of Administration. An amount not to exceed three percent (3%) of the total of all development impact fees collected may be allocated and applied for administration of this chapter. (f)  Annual Reports. By June 30th of each year the department of finance shall prepare and present to the mayor and council an annual report describing the amount of any development impact fees collected, encumbered and spent during the preceding year by category of public facility and service area. (g)  Payment of Bonds. Development impact fees may be used for the payment of principal and interest on bonds, notes or any other obligations issued by or on behalf of the city to finance the category of public facilities in the service area for which such fees were collected. (h)  Accounting for Recoupment Fees. That portion of development impact fees imposed by the city pursuant to subsection 19-1008(e) hereof to recoup, on a proportionate basis, improvement costs incurred by the city in the provision of excess capacity, shall be accounted for in a recoupment account and may be applied as necessary to reimburse the city for development impact fees that are waived pursuant to section 19-1016 hereof, with respect to affordable housing units and economic development projects. As initially adopted, parks and recreation impact fees for the Northside, Southside and Westside service areas and public safety impact fees are recoupment fees, and exemptions from these fees shall not require reimbursement of the respective impact fee accounts. At the beginning of each fiscal year, the chief financial officer (CFO) shall determine a percentage of total recoupment fees anticipated to be collected that will be necessary to reimburse nonrecoupment impact fee accounts for anticipated exemptions during the course of the year, and the CFO may periodically revise this percentage. All such recoupment fees collected shall be placed in a recoupment account to cover said exemptions. Provided further that monies accumulated in a recoupment account in excess of what is necessary for reimbursement for waived fees may be used for any public purpose not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act.     The provisions of this section shall be administered by the department of finance. (Code 1977, § 19-1013) 
Sec. 19-1014. - Credits. (a)  Policies. The following requirements shall apply to all credits against development impact fees otherwise permitted by this section: (1)  No credits shall be given for project improvements. (2)  Except for reimbursements allowed pursuant to subsection 19-1014(d)(4), credits shall be allowable and payable only to offset future development impact fees and shall not result in reimbursement from, nor constitute a liability of, the city. (3)  Credits shall be given only for the present value of any construction of improvements or contribution or dedication of land or money by a developer or his predecessor in title or interest for system improvements of the same category and in the same service area for which a development impact fee was imposed, except where further specific restrictions are set forth in this section. Any transfer or assignment of credits shall be expressly stated in writing, and in the absence of an express transfer or assignment of the right to any credit, the credit shall be deemed "not to run with the land." (4)  In the event that any development impact fee schedule is subsequently changed to reflect increases in construction costs or other relevant factors, a credit holder may request a recalculation of credits to fairly reflect such changed circumstances. In the event that any development impact fee schedule is subsequently changed to reflect decreases in construction costs or other relevant factors, the city may recalculate such credits to fairly reflect such changed circumstances. (5)  Any claim for a credit that is based upon any construction of improvements or contribution or dedication of land or money which was required or accepted by the city prior to the effective date shall be treated as a pre-ordinance credit regardless of the actual date of acceptance of the construction, contribution or dedication by the city. (b)  Computation of Credits. All credits shall be computed in accordance with the requirements set forth in this subsection. (1)  The present value of cash contributions shall be based on the face value of the cash payment at the time of contribution. (2)  For the present value of any contribution or dedication of land accepted for system improvements by the city from the developer, or his predecessor in title or interest, the value of contributed land shall be determined by the director based on a review of property appraisals applicable to the date of the dedication prepared by qualified professionals. (3)  The present value of construction of system improvements shall be the present value of the lower of the value of the completed improvements based on an appraisal prepared by qualified professionals acceptable to the city, or the actual construction cost of the improvements. The cost or appraisal basis shall be adjusted to the date of actual construction or dedication. (4)  The person claiming any credit shall be responsible for providing appraisals of land and improvements, construction cost figures, and documentation of all contributions and dedications necessary to the computation of the credits claimed. The city shall have no obligation to grant credit under this section to any person who cannot provide such documentation in such form as the director may reasonably require. The director may accept appraisals from the developer that were conducted contemporaneously with the original dedication or construction if the director determines that said appraisals are reasonably applicable to the computation of credit due. The director shall accept subsequent appraisals only if conducted by a certified appraiser or otherwise approved by the director in accordance with guidelines promulgated by the director. (5)  The city shall give credit only for construction of improvements or contribution or dedication of land or money actually accepted by the city. Deposit of a check shall be deemed acceptance of cash by the city. Only land dedications formally accepted by the city council or accepted by operation of law shall constitute acceptance for purposes of computing credits under this section. System improvements shall be deemed to be accepted only if and when the commissioner of public works or other applicable official has determined that such improvements meet applicable city standards and agreed on behalf of the city to accept such improvements for maintenance. The acceptance of an offer of dedication of land shall not constitute acceptance of any improvements located thereon unless the action accepting the dedication or other applicable city ordinance shall so provide. (6)  For the present value of any previously paid development impact fee, credit shall be equal to the amount of the development impact fee paid. (7)  In making the present value calculation, the percentage rate used shall be that of a State of Georgia "A-rated" or better municipal bond sold at the bond sale nearest the date on which the present value calculation is made. (c)  Time to Claim Credits. (1)  Any person claiming a credit shall apply to the director to claim such a credit no later than the date of application for the building permit to which the person applying wishes to have the credit apply. Any portion of a credit not claimed by such date shall be deemed waived. (2)  Any person claiming a pre-ordinance credit for construction, contributions or dedications pursuant to subsection 19-1014(e) shall file an application claiming the full amount of such credit with the director on or before April 1, 1994. (3)  Any person entitled to a pre-ordinance credit for construction, contributions or dedications pursuant to subsection 19-1014(e) must utilize said credit within ten years of the effective date. (4)  No credits of any kind shall be available for construction, contributions or dedications that occurred more than ten years prior to the effective date. (5)  The time for persons entitled to a pre-ordinance credit for construction, contributions or dedications pursuant to subsection 19-1014(e), and limited by subsection 19-1014(c)(3) to 10 years from the effective date, is extended until March 26, 2007. (d)  Post-Ordinance Credits/Reimbursements. Credit shall be given for the present value of the construction of improvements or contribution or dedication of land or money by a developer required or accepted by the city from the developer or his predecessor in title or interest for system improvements subsequent to the effective date ("Post-ordinance credits") in accordance with the following requirements: (1)  A person claiming post-ordinance credits shall submit to the director a project description in sufficient detail to allow the commissioner of the department of public works to prepare an engineering and construction cost estimate. A person proposing credit for system improvements shall present cost estimates and property appraisals prepared by qualified professionals to be used by the director in determining the amount of the credit. All construction must be made in accordance with applicable city development and design standards. A person proposing post-ordinance credits for land dedication shall present the director with property appraisals prepared by qualified professionals to be used by the director in determining the amount of credit. The director retains the right to determine the amount to be credited by causing to be prepared engineering and construction cost estimates and/or property appraisals for those improvements and/or right-of-way dedications. (2)  All other requirements of this section 19-1014 are met. (3)  In the event that post-ordinance credits are claimed prior to the completion of construction of the system improvements for which the post-ordinance credits is claimed, security to insure completion of the system improvements in the form of a performance bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or escrow agreement shall be posted with the city, made payable to the city in the amount approved by the director equal to 110 percent of the full cost of the construction of system improvements. If a system improvement will not be constructed within one year of the acceptance of the offer by the city, the amount of the security shall be increased by ten percent compounded, for each year of the life of the security. The security shall be reviewed and approved by the city's chief financial officer prior to the acceptance of the security by the city. (4)  In the event a developer contracts with the city to construct, fund, or contribute toward system improvements so that the amount of the post-ordinance credit created by such construction, funding or contribution is in excess of the development impact fee which would have been otherwise due and owing, the developer shall be reimbursed for such excess contribution, funding, or contribution from, and to the extent that, funds from development impact fees for the same category of system improvements located in the service area which has benefited by such improvements are available, provided such system improvements are included in the capital improvements program of the comprehensive development plan. A developer who is a party to such a contract may apply for reimbursement only after completing all buildings or other private improvements shown on any approved or proposed plans of that developer within the service area and thereby exhausting all available development impact fee credit opportunities. The city shall reimburse the developer within 180 days after the date development impact fees from other development in the service area are received by the department of finance. (e)  Pre-Ordinance Credits. Credit shall be given for the present value of the construction of improvements or contribution or dedication of land or money by a developer required or accepted by the city from the developer or his predecessor in title or interest for system improvements prior to the effective date as set forth in subsection 19-1014(a)(5) ("Pre-ordinance credit") in accordance with the following requirements: (1)  Said credits shall be applied only to development impact fees otherwise due for future development within the same service area and within the same category of system improvements. (2)  All other requirements of this section 19-1014 are met. (3)  The director shall deduct from the present value of the pre-ordinance credit the present value of the development impact fee that would have been charged for buildings or improvements within the project had this chapter been in effect on the date that the building permit(s) for construction of said buildings or improvements was filed, provided that said deductions will apply only to buildings or improvements for which a building permit was issued within ten years prior to the effective date. (4)  The time for the director to deduct from the present value of the development impact fee the present value of the development impact fee that would have been charged for buildings or improvements within the project had this chapter been in effect on the date that the building permit(s) for construction of said buildings or improvements was filed and which is limited by subsection 19-1014(e)(4) to permits filed prior to ten years from the effective date is extended until March 26, 2007. (f)  Abandonment of Building Permit. In the event that a developer pays a development impact fee and then abandons the building permit or other permit to which it was appurtenant without constructing the building or other improvement, the developer shall receive credit for the present value of any development impact fees paid. These credits shall be available only for use in payment of future development impact fees for the same lot or parcel of land for which they were originally paid. (Code 1977, § 19-1014; Ord. No. 2003-13, §§ 1, 2, 2-25-03; Ord. No. 2003-109, §§ 1, 2, 12-9-03) State Law reference— Credits for certain construction, O.C.G.A. § 36-71-7. 
Sec. 19-1015. - Refunds. (a)  Basis of Refunds. Upon application to the department of finance by an owner of property on which a development impact fee has been paid, the city shall refund 97 percent of the development impact fee if: (1)  Capacity is available and service is permanently denied; or (2)  If the city, after collecting the fee when service is not available, has failed to encumber the development impact fee or commence construction within six (6) years after the date the fee was collected. The city shall retain three percent (3%) of the fee paid as an administration fee. (b)  Accounting for Receipts. In determining whether development impact fees have been encumbered, development impact fees shall be considered encumbered on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. (c)  Notice of Refunds. When the right to a refund exists due to a failure to encumber development impact fees, the department of finance shall provide written notice of entitlement to a refund to the feepayor who paid the development impact fee at the address shown on the application for development approval, or to a feepayor's successor in interest who has given notice to the department of finance of a legal transfer or assignment of the right to entitlement to a refund and who has provided said department with a mailing address. Such notice shall also be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the city within 30 days after the expiration of the six-year period after the date that the development impact fees were collected and shall contain the heading "Notice of entitlement to development impact fee refund." (d)  Refund Applications. (1)  A refund application shall be made in writing to the department of finance within one (1) year of the date the refund becomes payable under subsections 19-1015(a), (b) or (c), or within one (1) year of publication of the notice of entitlement to a refund, whichever is later.
