Sec. 2-323. - Investing of city funds. (a)  Policy. It is the policy of the city to invest public funds in a manner that will provide maximum security and the best commensurate yield while meeting the daily cash flow demands of the city. This investment policy has been written in compliance with authority granted in Section 2-323 of the Atlanta City Code, O.C.G.A. § 36-83-4 and § 36-82-7, as it may be from time to time amended and will set forth the guidelines and objectives necessary to achieve a prudent cash and investment management program. (b)  Scope. This policy governs the investment of the "Restricted Investment Portfolio," and the "General Fund Portfolio", collectively known as the "Total Investment Portfolio." The restricted investment portfolio is comprised primarily of the debt service sinking funds and construction funds resulting from the proceeds of various city bond issues. These bond funds are unique in that they have associated legal covenants which detail specific types of legal investment instruments as per bond issue. The restricted investment portfolio shall be structured to meet known debt service payments and construction draw schedules. In addition to this policy, bond proceeds and other bond funds (including debt service and reserve funds) shall be invested in accordance with governing ordinance and by the provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, including all regulations and rulings promulgated thereunder applicable to the issuance of tax-exempt obligations.     The general investment portfolio is the largest portfolio, consisting of 16 funds that make up the concentration account. This portfolio encompasses the city's primary operating funds which include the general fund as well as various enterprise funds. The general investment portfolio shall be diversified by maturity date and structured to meet all anticipated net outflows that are projected to occur.     This policy shall be made available to anyone who has management responsibility for city funds, and in the absence of their specific investment policy, or not being otherwise governed by state law, this policy shall prevail. With respect to the funds of non-profit corporations that are established by city resolution and act as instrumentalities of the city, it is recommended that the city's investment policy be followed. (1)  Funds covered by this policy and managed as part of the pooled general investment portfolio: (2)  Funds covered by this policy and managed as part of the pooled restricted investment portfolio are as follows: Bond funds —Funds established with the proceeds from specific bond issues when it is determined that segregating these funds from the pooled funds portfolio will result in maximum interest earnings retention under the provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Bond reserve funds —Funds set at prescribed levels by certain bond ordinances to pay principal and/or interest if required to prevent default. (3)  Funds not governed by this policy include: General Employee's Pension Fund; Firefighters Pension Fund; Police Officers Pension Fund. Endowment funds —Funds given to the city with the instructions that the principal is to remain intact, unless otherwise agreed to, and the income generated by the investments will be used for specified purposes. (c)  Objective. Investment of the funds covered by this policy shall be governed by the following investment objectives, in order of priority: (1)  Legality. All investments shall fully comply with federal, state, and local laws. Additional requirements are discussed in the authorized and suitable investment section of this investment policy. (2)  Safety. Safety of principal is the primary objective of the investment policy. Investment of the city's funds shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital for the overall portfolio. To attain this objective, investment in only high quality securities and diversification are required in order that potential losses on individual securities do not exceed the income generated from the remainder of the portfolio (see subsection (m) "Diversification and maximum maturities"). (3)  Liquidity. The city's investment portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable the city to meet all operating requirements that might be reasonably anticipated. (4)  Yield. The city's investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return, throughout budgetary and economic cycles, while taking into consideration the investment risk constraints and cash flow characteristics of the portfolio. (d)  Delegation of authority. The chief financial officer shall assume ultimate responsibility regarding investment decisions on behalf of the city. Under the provisions of state and city codes, the chief financial officer has the ability to designate an employee of the department of finance to manage the daily investment of city funds. This responsibility has been designated to the Director - Treasury Services, who assumes the day-to-day investment decisions. All those responsible for making investment decisions shall be collectively referred to as "investment officers" for purposes of this policy. The chief financial officer is authorized to create forms and questionnaires deemed necessary to assist in the evaluation and selection of broker/dealers that will be required to be completed by that third-party in order to comply with the city's investment policies and state laws. (e)  Controls and procedures. The chief financial officer or his designee shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program consistent with this investment policy. Such procedures shall include explicit delegation of authority to any other persons responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction except as provided under the terms of this policy and the written procedures. Authority granted to a person to invest the city's funds is effective until rescinded or until termination of the person's employment by the city. The chief financial officer shall be responsible for all transactions undertaken and shall establish a system of controls to regulate the activities of subordinate officials. Both the chief financial officer and the cash and investment manager shall possess sufficient working knowledge of economics and securities markets, as well as the supervisory experience and judgment necessary to carry out the responsibilities outlined in this policy.     Formal written procedures shall also include but not be limited to: (1)  A formal process that outlines procedures relating to the purchase and sale of securities. (2)  A formal reporting system to monitor the performance of investment securities held. This system shall include written reports as outlined in subsection (o) of this policy. (3)  A reconciliation process that compares third-party security confirmations to internally produced reports and trade tickets. (4)  Performance measurement through the use of appropriate benchmarks that share the same characteristics of the general investment portfolio. (5)  A system of compliance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) of the Government Accounting Standards Board (GSFB). (6)  A system of internal controls, designed to detect errors, misrepresentation or imprudent actions. (7)  Thorough cross training of department employees to allow for back up of critical investment duties. (8)  An annual review of investment operations. (f)  Prudence. Investment officers shall adhere to the "prudence investor" standard as suggested by the Government Finance Officer's Association (GFOA), which states that: "Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the probable income to be derived." (1)  The "prudent investor" standard shall be applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio. Investment officers who exercise due diligence and act in accordance with the investment policy and written procedures, shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or market price changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments. (2)  Investment officers, while acting in accordance with this policy and written procedures pertaining to the administration and management of the city's assets, and who exercise proper due diligence, shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or market price changes, provided that deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion and appropriate action is taken to control and prevent any further adverse developments. (3)  Securities shall not be purchased with trading or speculation as the dominant selection criteria. (g)  Ethics and conflicts of interest. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could conflict with proper execution of the investment program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. (1)  Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall disclose any material interests in financial institutions with which they conduct business. (2)  Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall disclose any large personal financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the investment portfolio. The city statute on conflict of interest and disclosure shall be strictly followed. (h)  Authorized and suitable investments. City funds governed by this policy may be invested in the instruments described below, all of which are authorized by O.C.G.A. § 36-83-4. However, investments in instruments other than government securities shall be made only if the yield is equal to or greater than the bond equivalent yield on U.S. Treasury obligations of comparable maturity.     Investments not listed below, including collateralized mortgage obligations and reverse repurchase agreements, are strictly prohibited. In addition, the investment officers may at times restrict or prohibit the purchase of specific issues due to current market conditions.     An investment that requires a minimum rating under this section does not qualify, as an authorized investment during the period the investment does not have the minimum rating. The city shall take all prudent measures consistent with this investment policy to liquidate an investment that does not have the minimum rating.     The following securities are authorized under O.C.G.A. § 36-83-4: (1)  Obligations issued by the United States government; (2)  Obligations fully insured or guaranteed by the United States government or a United States government agency; (3)  Obligations of the State of Georgia or of other states; (4)  Obligations of other political subdivisions of the State of Georgia; (5)  Obligations of any corporation of the United States Government; (6)  Prime banker's acceptances; (7)  The local government investment pool established by O.C.G.A. § 36-83-8; (8)  Fully collateralized repurchase agreements provided the city has on file a signed master repurchase agreement, approved by the city attorney, which details eligible collateral, collateralization ratios, standards for collateral custody and control, collateral valuation, and conditions for agreement termination and provided the repurchase agreement: a.  Has a defined termination date; b.  Is secured by obligations in accordance with subsection (k) herein; c.  Requires the securities being purchased by the city to be assigned to the city, held in the city's name, and deposited at the time the investment is made with the city or with a third party selected and approved by the city; and d.  Is placed through a primary government securities dealer, as defined by the Federal Reserve, or a financial institution doing business in this state, and which is rated no less than A or its equivalent by two nationally recognized rating services. (i)  Authorized broker/dealers and financial institutions. The chief financial officer and designated investment staff shall review, revise, and adopt a list of qualified broker/dealers and financial institutions authorized to engage in investment transactions with the city. This list may include "primary" government securities dealers or regional dealers (inclusive of minority-owned firms, historically underutilized businesses (HUB's) and/or women-owned business enterprises (WBE's)) that qualify under the Securities & Exchange Commission Rule 15C3-1 (Uniform Net Capital Rule).     In order to be considered for approval, firms will be required to provide: (1)  Audited financial statements for the most recent period. (2)  Proof of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") certification resolution. (3)  Proof of registration with the state securities board. (4)  Clearing agreement (if net capital falls below $20,000,000.00). (5)  Completed broker/dealer questionnaire and acknowledgement of state and city investment policies. (6)  Such other documents as the chief financial officer may reasonably require.     Financial institutions and broker/dealers will be evaluated semi-annually to determine financial stability and degree of service.     No public deposit shall be made except in a qualified public depository as established by state law. (j)  Competitive bidding. It is the policy of the city to limit investment transactions to those banks and broker/dealers on the City of Atlanta's approved bid list. In addition, the city shall seek three competitive bids and offers on all individual security purchases and sales except for: (1)  Daily repurchase agreement; (2)  Short-term discount paper purchases; (3)  Transactions with the local government investment pools (which are deemed to be made at prevailing market rates); (4)  Treasury and agency securities purchased at issue or "to be announced" (TBA) through an approved broker/dealer or financial institution; or (5)  Automatic overnight "sweep" transactions with the city depository.     In situations where the exact security being offered is not offered by other dealers, offers on the closest comparable investment may be used to establish a fair market price for the security.     All bid and offers received shall be documented and retained on individual trade tickets or in trade logs. It shall be the responsibility of the investment officer associated with the transaction to record the following minimum information: Financial institution selected, rate quoted, security description, cover bids/offers, and special considerations in the event that the lowest priced security was not selected. (k)  Collateralization. The city requires that all uninsured collected balances plus accrued interest, if any, in depository accounts be secured in accordance with this policy. Financial institutions serving as city depositories will be required to sign a depository agreement with the city which details eligible collateral, collateralization ratios, standards for collateral custody and control, collateral valuation, rights of substitution and conditions for agreement termination.     The city requires that all securities purchased under the terms of a repurchase agreement be assigned to the city, with clearly marked evidence of ownership through safekeeping receipts. Dealers and financial institutions wishing to transact repurchase agreements with the city will be required to sign the a master repurchase agreement, subject to approval by the city, which details eligible collateral, collateralization ratios, standards for collateral custody and control, collateral valuation, rights of substitution, and conditions for agreement termination.     Collateral will always be held by an independent third party with whom the city has a current custodial agreement and shall be reviewed at least monthly to ensure that the market value of the pledged securities is adequate. The right of collateral substitution may be granted after obtaining prior approval from the city. (1)  Securities authorized for collateral under this policy are limited to those investments outlined in subsection (h)(1) through (h)(3). (2)  The collateralization level for repurchase agreements shall be 102 percent of the market value of principal and accrued interest. (3)  Depository products including certificates of deposit. (4)  The collateralization level for certificates of deposit shall be 110 percent in accordance to the Georgia Code O.C.G.A. § 45-8-12. (l)  Safekeeping and custody. Safekeeping and custody of securities and collateral shall be in accordance with state law. All securities transactions, except local government investment pool and money market mutual fund transactions, shall be conducted on a delivery versus payment (DVP) basis. Securities and collateral will be held by a third party custodian designated by the city, and held in the city's name as evidenced by original safekeeping receipts of the institution with which the securities are deposited. The custodian shall also provide monthly safekeeping statements that contain sufficient detail of securities held including, but not limited to, par, security type, CUSIP, maturity date, coupon and market value. Similarly, the city or the city's designated custodian shall take delivery of securities pledged as collateral on repurchase agreements with primary dealer firms. In repurchase transactions involving local banks, delivery is only required on agreements whose terms (m)  Diversification. The city shall seek to ladder the maturities of the portfolio to correspond with known projected cash flow needs, taking into consideration large reoccurring expenditure items such as payroll and bond disbursements.     The city shall seek to ladder the maturities of the portfolio to correspond with known liquidity needs, taking into consideration large reoccurring expenditure items such as payroll and bond disbursements. The city shall seek to maintain a weighted-average maturity of the total portfolio not to exceed five years and shall limit the maturity of any single security to five years.     The city's investment portfolios, in aggregate, should be diversified to limit market and credit risk in general accord with the following limitations: Investment Type MaximumMaturity** Ratings PortfolioLimitation MIN MAX U.S. Treasuries 5 years S&P > AA/A-2 Moody's > Aa2/P-1 Fitch > AA/A-2 15% 100% U.S. Agencies/Instrumentalities 5 years S&P > AA/A-2 Moody's > Aa2/P-1 Fitch > AA/A-2 0% 75% Obligations of other political subdivisions in the State of Georgia 5 years S&P > AA/A-2 Moody's > Aa2/P-1 Fitch > AA/A-2 0% 25% Other Municipal Securities 5 years S&P > AA/A-2 Moody's > Aa2/P-1 Fitch > AA/A-2 0% 25% Repurchase Agreements (Repos) 180 days S&P > AA/A-2 Moody's > Aa2/P-1 Fitch > AA/A-2 0% 50% Bankers Acceptances (BA's) 270 days S&P > AA/A-2 Moody's > Aa2/P-1 Fitch > AA/A-2 0% 10% Local Gov't Investment Pools N/A S&P > AA/A-2 Moody's > Aa2/P-1 Fitch > AA/A-2 0% 40% Certificates of Deposit (CD's) 3 years S&P > AA/A-2 Moody's > Aa2/P-1 Fitch > AA/A-2 0% 25%  (1)  The collateralization level for certificates of deposit shall be 110 percent in accordance to O.C.G.A. § 45-8-2. (2)  The city shall have the authority to invest up to $100,000,000.00 in municipal bonds which do not meet the maximum maturity and ratings guidelines above. Those $100,000,000.00 of municipal bonds will be allowed to have single security maximum maturities of up ten years and minimum investment grade ratings (BBB-/Baa3/BBB-). All other criteria herein will be still need to be met. The above allocation levels are intended to serve as guidelines for the investment manager. The allocation may be adjusted in response to changing market conditions, cash flow requirements and the discretion of the chief financial officer. Capital projects funds are further limited by certain arbitrage restrictions and specific bond covenants. Therefore, prior to investment of these funds, the likelihood of meeting rebate exceptions should be determined, and authorized investments as per the official bond statements shall be verified. (3)  With respect to bond proceeds and other bond funds, the city may, in the bond ordinance, specifically authorize investments in repurchase agreements with maturities in excess of 180 days subject to any required approvals from bond insurers. (n)  Security swap transactions. The city will seek to maximize its investment opportunities, when advantageous to do so, by selling securities that have become expensive or "rich" to the market and simultaneously purchasing similar securities that offer a higher relative return. This concurrent purchase and sales is commonly referred to as a "swap." The goal of this transaction type is to: (1)  Improve the quality of the portfolio by selling a security with a higher risk and buying a security with a lower risk; (2)  Adjusting the target duration of the portfolio; or (3)  Increase yield by purchasing a security with a higher relative return than the security being sold.     In certain instances, the city may incur a loss for accounting purposes in the sale of a security during a swap transaction. Such a loss will be considered acceptable only if the loss on the sale is expected to be smaller than the difference in yield advantage over the horizon period.     If a broker/dealer proposes a swap idea, that same broker/dealer shall be given a "last look" opportunity to match the lowest offer or highest bid. (o)  Portfolio monitoring. All trading losses incurred shall be reported immediately to the chief financial officer with appropriate documentation that formed the basis for the transaction. A summary of trading gains and losses shall be provided to the chief financial officer not less than monthly basis in order to determine the propriety of trading activity. This information will be included in the quarterly investment report.     While this policy prescribes various maximum and minimum limitations, it is intended primarily as a management tool. When the chief financial officer determines that an exception to one of the policy's numerical limits is in the best interest of the city, and is otherwise consistent with the investment policy, such exception is permitted so long as it is likewise consistent with applicable city, state and federal laws. All exceptions made to this policy and the appropriate explanation or justification for the exceptions shall be reported in the quarterly investment report.     Whenever an exception is caused by an inadvertent breach of these policies, that fact shall be reported in writing to the mayor and city council. Such report shall be made on a timely basis, but no later than five business days from the discovery date of the policy exception. (p)  Reporting. The cash and investment manager shall prepare a quarterly investment report. This report which will include a summary of the current status of the general investment portfolio and security transactions made over the prior quarter, will be delivered to each council member and the mayor. The quarterly investment report shall include: (1)  A review of the bond market and U.S. economy; (2)  Realized and unrealized gains or losses on the portfolio (in accordance with GASB requirements); (3)  Security allocation and maturity distribution of the portfolio; (4)  Portfolio characteristics as measured against selected benchmarks; (5)  Proposed portfolio strategy for the next reporting period; (6)  Detail of portfolio holdings; and (7)  Statement of compliance with written investment policy.     The above stated components of the portfolio performance reports can be adjusted at the discretion of the chief financial officer.     In addition, the portfolio shall be marked-to-market monthly and a report shall be produced and distributed to the chief financial officer showing realized/unrealized gains and losses on the portfolio at the end of each monthly reporting period. (q)  Investment strategies. The following strategies may be used to maximize return on investments: (1)  Asset/liability matching— Matching maturities to anticipated cash flow requirements. This strategy could extend the average weighted maturity of a subset of the portfolio and the absolute maturity of securities within the portfolio. (2)  Matching maturities to anticipated cash flow requirements. At times, this strategy may be exited. (3)  Maturity extension— A positive sloping or "normal" yield curve rewards longer-term investments. All purchase decisions that do not involve the matching of known cash needs shall be based on an analysis of the relative yield benefit to lengthening the maturity. (4)  Determination of an investment's relative value— By following historical spread relationships between different security types and issuers, it is possible to determine the securities that offer the best yield value on any given day.

These "swap" opportunities often occur as the spreads between different types of securities narrow or widen. (6)  Anticipating market changes— Although it is not possible to consistently predict market trends, an understanding of the factors that affect the market is important when determining an optimal maturity for the portfolio. Trading is not to be made solely on the basis of interest rate forecasts, but specific decisions involving maturity dates should consider short-term market expectations. (r)  Performance measurement. The investment performance of the City of Atlanta will be evaluated quarterly by comparison to established benchmarks. The selection of the benchmarks will be based upon the investment strategy and length of the investment portfolio and shall be approved by the chief financial officer and the city council.

Any actual offeror that has submitted a bid/proposal for a particular procurement and is aggrieved in connection with the solicitation or award of the contract shall protest in writing to the chief procurement officer after the date that the specific bid or proposal is submitted. No protest will be accepted or considered prior to the date the specific bid or proposal is submitted; it will be considered untimely. All protests shall set forth in full detail the factual and legal bases for the protest and specific relief sought by the protestor. Protests arising from factual or legal bases that the protestor knew or should have known prior to the submission of the bid/proposal must be submitted within three days of the submission of the bid/proposal. Protests arising from factual or legal bases that the protestor knew or should have known subsequent to the date the bid/proposal was submitted must be submitted within ten days after the protestor knew or should have known of such bases, but in no event shall any protest be submitted more than ten days after the award of the contract. Untimely protests will not be considered by the chief procurement officer and will be simply denied as untimely. (b)  Posting of protest security. Any actual offeror submitting a written bid/proposal that files a protest must, at the time of filing, post security in the amount of one percent of the financial offer of the protestor or, in the event the bid/proposal does not involve a fixed financial offer either in the form of payment of monies to the city or payment of monies to the offeror, $100,000.00, to be tendered in the form of a bond or certified check. (c)  Application of protest security.

If the city is represented by outside counsel, such fees and costs will be calculated at the billing rates of the firm's attorneys participating in the review and response to the protest, times the number of hours worked by such participating attorneys, plus all out of pocket costs of the firm concerning the protest. Within 15 days of denying the protest, the chief procurement officer, in consultation with the city's law department and outside counsel, if any, will calculate the city's cost in reviewing and responding to the protest and will apply the protester's bond or certified check to such costs. Any remaining balance of the bond or certified check will be returned to the protestor; provided, however, if the protester files an appeal of the city's denial of its protest pursuant to code section 2-1166, such certified check or bond will continue to be retained by the city to cover the costs of the city associated with such appeal. (d)  Decision on protest. If a protest is timely filed, the chief procurement officer shall inform the protestor of the decision in writing within ten days or, if the chief procurement officer requires more than ten days to render a decision, will advise the protestor within the initial ten days of the additional amount of time required to render a decision on the protest. (e)  Finality of decision.

Sec. 2-1162. - Debarment or suspension from consideration for contract award. (a)  Authority to debar or suspend. The chief procurement officer, after consulting with the city attorney, is authorized to debar a person for cause from participation in any city procurements at any tier and consideration for award of contracts. The debarment shall be for a period of not more than five years. The period of time during which the debarment will be imposed is to be determined by the chief procurement officer based upon the severity of the causes for debarment. After consultation with the using agency and city attorney, the chief procurement officer is authorized to suspend a person from participation in any city procurement at any tier and consideration for award of contracts if there is probable cause for debarment. The suspension shall not be for a period exceeding the greater of: (1) three months; (2) the period during which administrative review of the suspension is pending; or (3) the period during which judicial review of an administrative decision that was adverse to the suspended firm is pending. (b)  Causes for debarment or suspension. The causes for debarment or suspension include: (1)  Conviction for commission of a criminal offense as an incident to obtaining or attempting to obtain a public or private contract or subcontract or in the performance of such contract or subcontract. (2)  Conviction under state and federal statutes of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, receiving stolen property or any other offense indicating a lack of business integrity or business honesty which currently, seriously and directly affects responsibility as a city contractor. (3)  Conviction under state or federal antitrust statutes arising out of the solicitation and submission of bids or proposals. (4)  Violation of contract provisions, as set forth below, of a character which is regarded by the chief procurement officer to be so serious as to justify debarment action: a.  Deliberate failure to perform in accordance with the provisions or within the time limit provided in any city contract. b.  A recent record of failure to perform or of unsatisfactory performance in accordance with the terms of one or more contracts, provided that failure to perform or unsatisfactory performance caused by acts beyond the control of the contractor shall not be considered to be a basis for debarment. In the event that the contractor asserts in a city suspension or debarment proceeding that such recent failure to perform or unsatisfactory performance in accordance with the terms of one or more contracts was caused by acts beyond the control of the contractor, the contractor must introduce documentation from the applicable contract/project in which it provided notice of such acts beyond its control and/or invoked its rights to equitable adjustment or other similar remedies under the applicable contract as a result of force majeure or other similar events; provided, however, that the city's determination on such issue will be independent from the contract/project at issue. It is insufficient in a city debarment proceeding for the contractor to raise this issue for the first time concerning a prior contract under which it failed to perform or performed unsatisfactorily. (5)  Violation of the ethical standards set forth in division 13 of this article. (6)  Submission to the city of a claim for additional compensation that is without merit, including, but not limited to claims seeking to recoup: a.  Costs incurred by the contractor but not included in its bid or proposal due to its own error; b.  Costs that it has already been paid or will be paid under the contract; c.  Costs asserted simply for the purpose of forcing the city to consider a settlement at a reduced amount; d.  Costs that the contractor has not certified pursuant to the contract documents; and e.  Costs that the contractor would not be entitled to recover under the contract documents, including, but not limited to attorneys fees and interest on unpaid sums. (7)  Knowing misrepresentation to the city of the use which a majority-owned contractor intends to make of a minority and female business enterprise (a business entity at least 51 percent of which is owned and controlled by one or more African Americans, Asian Pacific Americans, Hispanic Americans, or females, or a combination thereof, as defined in section 2-1443 and certified as such by the city), as a subcontractor, member of a mentor-protégé relationship, or a joint venture partner, in performing work under a contract with the city. (8)  Material misrepresentation of the composition of the ownership or work force of a business entity certified to the city as a minority and female business enterprise. (9)  Any other cause the chief procurement officer, in consultation with the using agency and city attorney, determines to be so serious and compelling as to affect responsibility, including, but not limited to, debarment by another governmental entity. (c)  Notice. The chief procurement officer shall issue a written notice of the decision to debar or suspend. The notice shall state the reasons for the action taken and the effective date of the debarment or suspension and shall inform the debarred or suspended person involved of the right to administrative review as provided in this division. (d)  Finality of decision. A decision under subsection (c) of this section is final and conclusive, unless fraudulent or any person adversely affected by the decision appeals administratively to the procurement appeals hearing officer in accordance with this division. (e)  City council initiated debarment. The city's council, by enactment of an appropriate resolution, may request that the chief procurement officer initiate an investigation into whether a particular person should be debarred and/or suspended and, after consulting with the city attorney, the chief procurement officer is authorized to debar or suspend such person for cause from participation in any city procurements at any tier and consideration for award of contracts. (Ord. No. 2009-78(09-O-1876), § 3, 12-15-09)

This section applies where it is determined by administrative review that a solicitation or award of a contract is in violation of applicable law. For purposes of this section administrative review shall refer to a review by the chief procurement officer, in consultation with the city attorney, or a review by an appropriate procurement or office of contract compliance hearing officer. A determination by the chief procurement officer may be made independently and as a result of the chief procurement officer receiving a decision from an appeals officer that a solicitation or award of a contract is in violation of applicable law. (b)  Remedies prior to award. If, prior to award, the chief procurement officer, after consultation with the city attorney, determines that a solicitation or proposed award of a contract is in violation of law, the solicitation or proposed award shall be canceled or revised to comply with the law. (c)  Remedies after award. If, after an award, the chief procurement officer, after consultation with the city attorney, determines that a solicitation or award of a contract is in violation of applicable law, then: (1)  If the person awarded the contract has not acted fraudulently or in bad faith: a.  The contract may be ratified and affirmed, provided it is determined that doing so is in the best interest of the city; or b.  If services or work have not commenced under the contract, it may be terminated and the person awarded the contract shall be compensated for the actual expenses reasonably incurred in preparing to perform and in terminating its performance under the contract, plus a reasonable profit, prior to the termination; or c.  If services or work have commenced under the contract, it may be terminated and the person awarded the contract shall be compensated for the actual expenses reasonably incurred in preparing to perform and in terminating its performance under the contract, plus a reasonable profit, prior to the termination, less any amount previously paid to it under the contract. (2)  If the person awarded the contract has acted fraudulently or in bad faith: a.  The contract may be declared null and void; or b.  The contract may be ratified and affirmed if such action is in the best interests of the city, without prejudice to the city's right to such damages as may be appropriate. (Ord.

Upon receipt of the notice of appeal from the aggrieved party by the chief procurement officer, the chief procurement officer shall forward the notice to a procurement appeals hearing officer within three days of receipt of the notice.

The officer shall cause notice of the hearing date, time and location to be served upon all parties, by registered mail. (2)  At the hearing, all parties shall be provided a fair and impartial hearing and shall be allowed to produce any and all admissible evidence in either party's possession concerning the appeal. (c)  Decision. The procurement appeals hearing officer shall, within seven days of the hearing, make a written decision on the appeal, which decision shall affirm or deny the decision by the chief procurement officer. The officer shall decide whether: (1)  The solicitation or award being appealed was in accordance with applicable law and the terms and conditions of the solicitation; or (2)  The debarment or suspension being appealed was in accordance with applicable law and in the best interest of the city and was fair. (d)  Notice of decision.

If the protestor appeals the decision of the procurement appeals hearing officer to the superior court, the city shall continue to hold the bond or certified check of the protester pending the results of the appeal to superior court. If the protester is unsuccessful in the superior court, the city shall deduct from the bond or certified check all of its costs associated with its review and response to the protest, its preparation for and attendance at the procurement appeals hearing and its response to, preparation for and attendance at any hearing held in superior court concerning protest and subsequent appeals. The city's costs in responding to, preparing for and attending any hearing in the superior court will be calculated in the same manner as its costs in preparing for and attending a procurement appeals hearing. (Ord.

The invitation for bids shall set forth the evaluation criteria to be used. (i)  Correction or withdrawal of bids. (1)  Before bid opening. Correction or withdrawal of bids may be allowed by the chief procurement officer before the scheduled time and date of bid opening. The offeror may withdraw the bid, without revealing the amount of the bid, by submitting a new sealed bid or providing written notice of withdrawal before bid opening. Notice of withdrawal shall be received by the chief procurement officer prior to bid opening. (2)  After bid opening. After bid opening, corrections in bids shall be permitted only to the extent that the offeror can show by clear and convincing evidence that a mistake of a nonjudgmental character was made, the nature of the mistake, and the bid price actually intended.

In lieu of bid correction, a low bidder alleging a material mistake of fact may be permitted to withdraw its bid if: a.  The mistake is clearly evident on the face of the bid document, but the intended correct bid is not similarly evident; or b.  The bidder submits evidence that clearly and convincingly demonstrates that a mistake was made.     All decisions to permit the correction or withdrawal of bids shall be supported by a written determination made by the chief procurement officer. (j)  Tie bids. If two or more offerors are tied in price while otherwise meeting all of the required conditions, the contract shall be awarded to an offeror whose principal place of business is within the city or, if not within the city, within the metropolitan Atlanta area or, if not within the city or metropolitan area, within the state. Where no offeror is located within the state, the chief procurement officer shall award the contract to the offeror whose principal place of business is the closest to the city. (k)  Award. The contract shall be awarded with reasonable promptness by written notice to the most responsible and responsive offeror whose bid meets the requirements and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids. In determining the most responsible and responsive offeror, the chief procurement officer, in consultation with the using agency, shall consider the following: (1)  The ability, capacity and skill of the offeror to perform the contract and provide the services/supplies required; (2)  The capability of the offeror to perform the contract and provide the services/supplies promptly or within the time specified without delay or interference; (3)  The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience and efficiency of the offeror; (4)  The quality of performance of the offeror of previous contracts and provision of services/supplies; (5)  The previous and existing compliance by the offeror with laws and ordinances relating to the contract and provision of services/supplies; (6)  The sufficiency of the financial resources and ability of the offeror to perform the contract and provide the services/supplies; (7)  The compliance of the offeror with the requirements of an equal employment opportunity in contracting program as may be required by ordinance; (8)  When applicable, the compliance of the offeror with the requirements of a minority and female business enterprise participation program as may be required by ordinance; (9)  The compliance of the offeror with the requirements of a local preference program as may be required by ordinance; (10)  The quality, availability and adaptability of the supplies or services to the particular use required; and (11)  The price. If all bids exceed available funds as certified by the chief financial officer and the most responsible and responsive bid does not exceed such funds by more than five percent, the chief procurement officer is authorized, when time or economic considerations preclude resolicitation of a reduced scope, to negotiate an adjustment of the bid price, including changes in the bid requirements, with the most responsible and responsive offeror in order to bring the bid within the amount of available funds. (l)  Multi-step sealed bidding. When it is considered impractical to initially prepare a purchase description to support an award based on price, an invitation for bids may be issued requesting the submission of unpriced offers to be followed by an invitation for bids limited to those offerors whose offers have been qualified under the criteria set forth in the first solicitation. (m)  Substitution, replacement by uncertified minority business enterprise or female business enterprise prohibited. An offeror may not substitute for or replace any minority business enterprise (MBE) or female business enterprise (FBE), as those terms are defined in section 2-1443, when that MBE or FBE has been designated in writing by the offeror as a subcontractor for the contract on which the offeror has submitted a bid, if the MBE or FBE submitted as a part of the bid is not a certified, legitimate MBE or FBE, as determined by the office of contract compliance. If the office of contract compliance determines that the MBE or FBE is not legitimate or certified, the bid of the contractor who submitted the bid shall be rejected. (n)  The office of contract compliance shall evaluate each such bid as to the offeror's compliance with subsections (k)(7) and (8) of this section and shall notify the chief procurement officer, in writing, whether the bid is responsive or nonresponsive. (Ord. No. 2009-78(09-O-1876), § 4, 12-15-09; Ord. No. 2013-47(13-O-1277), § 1, 10-16-13 ; Ord. No. 2019-04(18-O-1779), § 1, 1-15-19 ) 
Sec. 2-1188.1. - Local preference. (a)  Applicability. This local preference program shall only apply to any city contract (referred to hereinafter as "Eligible local projects") procured under section 2-1188 competitive sealed bidding. It does not apply to procurements utilizing competitive sealed proposals under section 2-1189, small purchases under section 2-1190, sole source procurement under section 2-1191, emergency procurement under section 2-1192, competitive selection procedures for professional and consultant services under section 2-1193 and federally-funded projects. (b)  Statement of policy. The city has a significant interest in encouraging the creation of employment opportunities for its residents and for businesses located within the city. As a purchaser of goods and services, the city will benefit from expanded job and business opportunities for its residents and businesses through additional revenues generated by its activities. It is in the interest of the city and its residents to give preference on eligible local projects to those eligible offerors who have direct physical and economic relationships with the city. (c)  Certification as a local offeror. In order to be certified as a local offeror, an eligible offeror must submit a completed application to the department of procurement, and the applicant must be approved and certified by the department of procurement. An eligible offeror must submit a completed and signed written application to become a local offeror before it will be allowed to receive a bid preference on an eligible local project. In order to be approved as a local offeror and receive a bid preference on an eligible local project, the application for approval as a local offeror and all supporting documents must be received by the department of procurement at least 30 days prior to the date bids are received on such eligible local project. An eligible offeror who fails to submit an application for approval as a local offeror at least 30 days prior to the date bids are received on an eligible local project, and who otherwise meets the requirements for approval as a local offeror, will not be qualified for a bid preference on such eligible local project. (d)  Criteria. To be certified as a local offeror, the eligible offeror must satisfy no less than two of the following criteria: (1)  The eligible offeror's principal place of business is located in the city or that the eligible offeror has held a valid city business license for at least one year prior to the date of application. (2)  A majority of the full time employees, chief officers, and managers of the eligible offeror have regularly conducted work and business in the city for at least one year prior to the date of application. (3)  A majority of the employees based at the eligible offeror's location(s) in the city have been residents of the city for at least one year prior to the date of application. (4)  The services the eligible offeror offers to the city have been provided by the eligible offeror in the city for at least one year prior to the date of application.     If the applicant is a joint venture or mentor-protégé team, each participant in the joint venture or mentor-protégé team must be approved independently as a local offeror in order for the joint venture or mentor-protégé team to receive the bid preference on eligible local projects. (e)  Term. The certification as a local offeror shall expire two years from the date of the approval of the application. Following the expiration date, a business is no longer a local offeror. An eligible offeror must submit a new application for certification as a local offeror to the department of procurement and establish that it continues to meet the requirements contained in paragraph (d) of this section in order to receive a bid preference on eligible local projects. (f)  Determining responsiveness of non-local offerors. The geographic location of an eligible offeror shall be one of the factors considered by the department of procurement in determining whether a bid on an eligible local project is responsive. A bid submitted by a non-local offeror shall be deemed non-responsive on the basis that the eligible offeror is a non-local offeror, unless: (1)  For eligible local projects valued at less than $500,000.00, the amount of the bid submitted by the non-local offeror is ten percent lower than the lowest responsible and responsive bid submitted by a local offeror; (2)  For eligible local projects valued at $500,000.00 or more, the amount of the bid submitted by the non-local offeror is five percent lower than the lowest responsible and responsive bid submitted by a local offeror; (3)  The bid submitted by the non-local offeror would be responsible and responsive but for the fact that the eligible offeror is a non-local offeror; and (4)  The amount of the bid submitted by the non-local offeror is lowest among bids submitted by other non-local offerors that would be responsible and responsive but for the fact that such other eligible offerors are non-local offerors. (g)  Continuing obligations of eligible offerors certified as local offerors. Eligible offerors certified as local offerors shall be under a continuing duty to immediately inform the department of procurement in writing of any changes in the eligible offeror's business if, as a result of such ;changes, the eligible offeror no longer satisfies the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section. (Ord. No. 2009-78(09-O-1876), § 4, 12-15-09)

The office of contract compliance shall evaluate each proponent's conformance to the city's EEO ordinance and, where applicable, the city's EBO ordinance according to relative weights assigned by the chief procurement officer. The combined weights may not exceed 15 percent of the total evaluation points. Each request for proposal shall state with specificity the method by which EEO and EBO compliance is weighted to arrive at numerical evaluation points. Proposals that are noncompliant with the city's EEO or EBO requirements, where applicable, shall be deemed nonresponsive without further evaluation of any other solicitation evaluation factors. (e)  Negotiations and award. The chief procurement officer shall negotiate a contract with the most responsible and responsive short-listed offeror at compensation that the chief procurement officer determines in writing to be fair and reasonable to the city. In making this decision, the chief procurement officer shall take into account the estimated value, the scope, the complexity and the professional nature of the services to be rendered. Should the chief procurement officer be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the offeror considered to be the most responsible and responsive at a price for the chief procurement officer determines to be fair and reasonable to the city, negotiations with that offeror shall be terminated. The chief procurement officer shall then undertake negotiations with the second most responsible and responsive short-listed offeror. If negotiations with the second most responsible and responsive short-listed offeror are unsuccessful, negotiations shall be terminated and the chief procurement officer shall then undertake negotiations with the third most responsible and responsive short-listed offeror. Should the chief procurement officer be unable to negotiate a contract with any of the short-listed offerors, the chief procurement officer and the using agency may select from the additional offerors that were not short-listed in order of their responsibility and responsiveness and the chief procurement officer may continue negotiations in accordance with this section until an agreement is reached. (Ord.

If an offeror who otherwise would have been awarded a contract is found nonresponsible, a written determination of nonresponsibility setting forth the basis of the finding shall be prepared by the chief procurement officer. The unreasonable failure of an offeror to supply information in connection with an inquiry with respect to responsibility may be grounds for a determination of nonresponsibility. A copy of the determination shall be sent to the nonresponsible offeror and shall inform the offeror of the right to protest under division 3 of this article. (Ord.

Bid security shall be in an amount equal to at least five percent of the amount of the bid. Unsuccessful offerors shall be entitled to the return of the bid security. Upon failure of a successful offeror to enter into a contract within ten days after the chief procurement officer tenders the proposed contract, the offeror shall forfeit the bid security. (c)  Rejection of bids for noncompliance with supplying bid security.

The chief procurement officer is authorized to reduce or waive performance and payment bonds for contracts for supplies and services for $20,000.00 or less, when the chief procurement officer makes a written determination that it is in the best interests of the city to do so. Nothing in this section prevents the requirement of such bonds on supply or service contracts under $20,000.00 when the chief procurement officer determines that the circumstances warrant. (c)  Authority to require additional bonds. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the city to require other security in addition to those bonds or in circumstances other than those specified in subsections (a) and (b) of this section. (d)  Right to institute suit on payment bond; jurisdiction and time limits for suits upon payment bonds. The right to institute suit and jurisdiction and time limits for suits upon payment bonds provided under this section will be governed by the provisions of Title 13, Chapter 10, Article 1, p. 4 of the Georgia Code. (Ord.

DIVISION 9. - SMALL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM 
Sec. 2-1356. - Short title.     This division shall be known as the "City of Atlanta's Small Business Opportunity Program." (Ord. No. 2009-78(09-O-1876), § 9, 12-15-09) 
Sec. 2-1357. - Definitions.     The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this, division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:     Affiliates: OCC shall consider all affiliates of a business enterprise in determining whether the business enterprise qualifies for SBE status. In general, concerns and entities are affiliates of each other when one controls or has the power to control the other, or a third party or parties controls or has the power to control both. It does not matter whether control is exercised, so long as the power to control exists. The determination whether two or more business enterprises are affiliates shall follow the guidelines regarding affiliation as set forth in 13 C.F.R. § 121.103, as amended.     Atlanta Region shall mean the geographical area consisting of Barrow, Bartow, Carroll, Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, Coweta, DeKalb, Douglas, Fayette, Forsyth, Fulton, Gwinnett, Henry, Newton, Paulding, Pickens, Rockdale, Spalding, and Walton counties.     Bid shall mean a quotation, proposal, sealed bid or offer to perform or provide labor, materials, supplies or services to the city for a price on an eligible project, or for an eligible project that generates revenue for the city.     Bidder shall mean any individual, sole proprietorship, partnership, joint venture, or corporation that submits a bid to the city.     City shall mean the City of Atlanta.     Commercially useful function: For the purpose of determining whether a business enterprise is performing a commercially useful function, upon a challenge to the SBE status pursuant to section 2-1365, OCC shall consider all of the facts in the record, viewed as a whole, including without limitation the following: (1)  A SBE performs a commercially useful function when it is responsible for execution of the work of the contract and is carrying out its responsibilities by actually performing, managing, and supervising the work involved. (2)  To perform a commercially useful function, the SBE must be responsible, with respect to material and supplies used on the contract, for negotiating price, determining quality and quantity, ordering the material, and installing (where applicable) and paying for the material itself. (3)  A SBE does not perform a commercially useful function if its role is limited to that of an extra participant in a transaction, contract, or project through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of SBE participation.     Contractor shall mean a prime contractor or vendor on a city contract.     Control or controlled: For the purpose of determining whether the owner or owners of a potential SBE (as used in this definition, "SBE-owner", which shall denote one or more owners) controls the potential SBE, upon a challenge to the SBE status pursuant to section 2-1365, OCC shall consider all of the facts in the record, viewed as a whole, including without limitation the following: (1)  For a SBE-owner to be deemed to control the potential SBE, the potential SBE must be independent. An independent business enterprise is a business whose viability does not depend on its relationship with another firm or firms. (a)  In determining whether a potential SBE is independent, OCC will scrutinize the SBE's relationships with other firms, in such areas as personnel, facilities, equipment, financial and/or bonding support, and other resources. (b)  OCC will consider whether present or recent employer/employee relationships between the SBE-owner and other firms or persons associated with other firms compromise the independence of the potential SBE. (c)  OCC will examine the potential SBE's relationships with prime contractors to determine whether a pattern of exclusive or primary dealings with a prime contractor compromises the independence of the potential SBE. (d)  In considering factors related to the independence of a potential SBE, OCC will consider the consistency of relationships between the potential SBE and other firms with normal industry practice. (2)  A potential SBE must not be subject to any formal or informal restrictions which limit the customary discretion of the SBE-owner. There can be no restrictions through corporate charter provisions, by-law provisions, contracts or any other formal or informal devices (e.g., cumulative voting rights, voting powers attached to different classes of stock, employment contracts, requirements for concurrence by persons other than the SBE-owner, conditions precedent or subsequent, executory agreements, voting trusts, restrictions on or assignments of voting rights) that prevent the SBE-owner, without the cooperation or vote of any other individual, from making any business decision of the business enterprise. This paragraph does not preclude a spousal co-signature on documents. (3)  The SBE-owner must possess the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the business enterprise and to make day-to-day as well as long-term decisions on matters of management, policy and operations. (a)  A SBE-owner must hold the highest officer position in the company (e.g., chief executive officer or president). (b)  In a corporation, the SBE-owner must control the board of directors. (c)  In a partnership, the SBE-owner must serve as a general partner, with control over all partnership decisions. (4)  Individuals who are not the SBE-owner may be involved in an SBE as owners, managers, employees, stockholders, officers, and/or directors. Such individuals must not, however, possess or exercise the power to control the business enterprise, or be disproportionately responsible for the operation of the business enterprise. (5)  The SBE-owner may delegate various areas of the management, policymaking, or daily operations of the business enterprise to other participants in the firm. Such delegations of authority must be revocable, and the SBE-owner must retain the power to hire and fire any person to whom such authority is delegated. The managerial role of the SBE-owner in the business enterprise's overall affairs must be such that OCC can reasonably conclude that the SBE-owner actually exercises control over the business enterprise's operations, management, and policy. (6)  The SBE-owner must have an overall understanding of, and managerial and technical competence and experience directly related to the type of business in which the business enterprise is engaged and the business enterprise's operations. The SBE-owner is not required to have experience or expertise in every critical area of the business enterprise's operations, or to have greater experience or expertise in a given field than managers or key employees. The SBE-owner must have the ability to intelligently and critically evaluate information presented by other participants in the business enterprise's activities and to use this information to make independent decisions concerning the business enterprise's daily operations, management, and policymaking. Generally, expertise limited to office management, administration, or bookkeeping functions unrelated to the principal business activities of the business enterprise is insufficient to demonstrate control. (7)  If state or local law requires the owner of a particular type of firm to have a particular license or other credential, then the SBE-owner of that type of firm must possess the required license or credential in order to be deemed in control. If state or local law does not require an owner to have such a license or credential, OCC will not deny certification solely on the ground that the SBE-owner lacks the license or credential. However, OCC may take into account the absence of the license or credential as one factor in determining whether the SBE-owner actually controls the firm. (8)  OCC may consider differences in remuneration between the SBE-owner and other participants in the business enterprise in determining whether the SBE-owner controls the business enterprise. Such consideration shall be in the context of the duties of the persons involved, normal industry practices, the business enterprise's policy and practice concerning reinvestment of income, and any other explanations for the differences proffered by the business enterprise. OCC may determine that a business enterprise is controlled by its SBE-owner although the SBE-owner's remuneration is lower than that of some other participants in the business enterprise. In a case where someone other than the SBE-owner formerly controlled the business enterprise, and the SBE-owner now controls it, OCC may consider a difference between the remuneration of the former and current owner of the business enterprise as a factor in determining who controls the business enterprise, particularly when the former owner remains involved with the business enterprise and continues to receive greater compensation than the current SBE-owner. (9)  In order to be viewed as controlling a business enterprise, an SBE-owner cannot engage in outside employment or other business interests that conflict with the management of the business enterprise or prevent the SBE-owner from devoting sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the business enterprise to control its activities. For example, absentee ownership of a business and part- time work in a fulltime firm are not viewed as constituting control. However, an SBE-owner could be viewed as controlling a part-time business that operates only on evenings and/or weekends, if the SBE-owner controls the business enterprise when it is operating. (10)  An SBE-owner may control a business enterprise even though one or more of the SBE-owner's immediate family members participate in the business enterprise as a manager, employee, owner, or in another capacity. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, OCC must make a judgment about the control the SBE-owner exercises vis-a-vis other persons involved in the business enterprise as it does in other situations, without regard to whether or not the other persons are immediate family members. If OCC cannot determine that the SBE-owner—as distinct from the family as a whole-controls the business enterprise, then the SBE-owner has failed to carry her/his burden of proof concerning control, even though s/he may participate significantly in the business enterprise's activities.     Day or days shall refer to calendar days.     Eligible project shall mean: Any city contract as described in section 2-1188 and section 2-1189 or as identified by the director of the office of contract compliance, excluding sole source procurement under section 2-1191, special procurement under section 2-1191.1, emergency procurement under section 2-1192, and contracts governed by 49 CFR Parts 23 and 26.     Joint venture shall mean an association of two or more persons, partnerships, corporations, or any combination of them, established to carry on a single business activity that is limited in scope and duration. The agreement establishing the joint venture, partnership or other multi-entity relationship shall be in writing. Further, participation in a joint venture shall be based on the sharing of real economic interest in the venture and shall include proportionate control over management, interest in capital acquired by the joint venture and interest in earnings.     Office of contract compliance (OCC) shall mean the Mayor's Office of Contract Compliance in the City of Atlanta.     Small business enterprise (SBE) shall mean a firm located in the Atlanta Region which is an independent and continuing enterprise for profit, performing a commercially useful function, for which the gross revenues or number of employees, inclusive of any Affiliates as defined by 13 C.F.R. Sec. 121.103, does not exceed the size standards as defined pursuant to 13 C.F.R. § 121.201 (as further explained in 13 C.F.R. §§ 121.104 through 121.107), and which has: (1) filed a letter or other documentation from the United States Small Business Administration with OCC that establishes that the firm qualifies as an 8(a) firm or HUBZone firm with the United States Small Business Administration; (2) obtained certification as a disadvantaged business enterprise ("DBE") in the State of Georgia, including any agency or department of the State of Georgia, or the United States Department of Transportation; or (3) submitted evidence to OCC on a form to be prescribed by OCC affirming under penalty of perjury that the business does not exceed the size standards referenced in this definition.     SBE status shall mean whether a firm meets the qualification criteria of a small business enterprise, as set forth in this division.     Self-certification shall refer to the provision in the previous version of this Ordinance (Ord. No. 2009-78(09-O-1876), § 9, 12-15-09) which required affirmative representation that a business meets the qualification criteria of a small business enterprise, as set forth in this division, on a form to be prescribed by OCC and filed with OCC affirming under penalty of perjury that the business qualifies as an SBE. Self-certification applies only to SBEs which are self-certified under the prior Ordinance (Ord. No. 2009-78(09-O-1876), § 9, 12-15-09) at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance. Any self-certified SBE must comply with the certification requirements of this Ordinance once the SBE's self-certification expires.     Supplier shall mean a warehouser or manufacturer of materials, supplies or equipment which contracts directly with a bidder to provide such materials, supplies or equipment on an eligible project which involves a trade or service. For purposes of measuring the total contract dollars awarded or paid to suppliers on eligible projects, only amounts paid to suppliers of goods customarily and ordinarily used based upon standard industry or trade practices shall be counted. (Ord. No. 2009-78(09-O-1876), § 9, 12-15-09; Ord. No. 2015-63(15-O-1556), §§ 7—9, 12-16-15 ) 
Sec. 2-1358. - Statement of policy.     In conjunction with the City of Atlanta's Equal Business Opportunity Program, it is the purpose of this small business opportunity program to promote the economic welfare of the people of the City of Atlanta, to promote full and equal business opportunity for all persons doing business with the City of Atlanta, to promote commerce by assisting SBEs to actively participate in the city's procurement process, and to ensure the City of Atlanta utilizes programs that provide it with the best possible resources. In order to encourage competition, the foundation of the free enterprise system, the City of Atlanta's policy will ensure that a fair proportion of the total purchases and contracts or subcontracts for property, commodities, and services come from small businesses so long as the property, commodities and services of small businesses are competitive as to price and quality.

Sec. 2-1372. - Means to ensure that competitors make good faith efforts to meet SBE contract goals. (a)  For all contracts for which SBE contract goals have been established, the bidder shall be required to submit SBE participation information to the City of Atlanta. The award of the contract will be conditioned upon satisfaction of the requirements established by the city. The bidder shall submit, with its bid submission, the following information: (1)  The name, address and certification number, if applicable, of the SBE firm(s) that will participate in the contract; (2)  The description of the work each named SBE will perform; and (3)  The dollar amount of participation by each named SBE firm. (b)  If the SBE participation submitted by the bidder does not meet the SBE contract goals, the bidder must submit with its bid submission evidence demonstrating that "good faith efforts" were made to meet the goals. The city will review documents submitted at the time of bid, and make its determination of good faith efforts based on those submitted documents. Additional submissions will not be permitted. To demonstrate sufficient "good faith efforts" to meet the SBE contract goal, a bidder/proposer shall document the steps it has taken to obtain SBE participation. Such documentation may include evidence of the following: (1)  Attendance at a pre-bid meeting, if any, scheduled by the city to inform SBEs of subcontracting opportunities under a given solicitation; (2)  Advertisement in general circulation media, trade association publications, and other media for at least 15 days before bids or proposals are due; (3)  Written notification to SBEs that their interest in the contract is solicited; (4)  Efforts made to select portions of the work proposed to be performed by SBEs in order to increase the likelihood of achieving the stated goal; (5)  Good faith efforts to negotiate with SBEs for specific subcontracts, including without limitation: a.  The names, addresses, and telephone numbers of SBEs that were contacted; b.  A description of the information provided to SBEs regarding the plans and specifications for portions of the work to be performed; c.  A statement of why additional agreements with SBE were not reached; d.  Concerning each SBE, the SBE contacted but rejected as unqualified, and the reasons for the bidder's conclusion; and e.  Efforts made to assist the SBEs contacted that needed assistance in obtaining bonding or insurance required by the competitor or the city. (c)  To determine whether a competitor that has failed to meet SBE goals may be awarded the contract, the city will determine whether the efforts the bidder made to obtain SBE participation were "good faith efforts." Efforts that are merely pro forma are not "good faith efforts" to meet the goals. In order to award a contract to a bidder that has failed to meet SBE contract goals, the office of contract compliance will determine whether the bidder actively and aggressively made efforts to meet the city's SBE goals. A bidder making a good faith effort would consider a number of factors in negotiating with subcontractors, including SBE subcontractors, and would take a firm's price and capabilities as well as contract goals into consideration. However, the fact that there may be some additional costs involved in finding and using SBEs is not in itself sufficient reason for a bidder's failure to meet the contract SBE goal, as long as such costs are reasonable. Also, the ability or desire of a prime contractor to perform the work of a contract with its own organization does not relieve the bidder of the responsibility to make good faith efforts. Prime contractors are not, however, required to accept higher quotes from SBEs if the price difference is excessive or unreasonable. In determining whether a bidder has made good faith efforts, the office of contract compliance will take into account the performance of other bidders in meeting the contract. For example, when the apparent successful bidder fails to meet the contract goal, but others meet it, the office of contract compliance may reasonably raise the question of whether, with additional reasonable efforts, the apparent successful bidder could have met the goal. If the apparent successful bidder fails to meet the goal but meets or exceeds the average SBE participation obtained by other bidders, the city may view this, in conjunction with other factors, as evidence of the apparent successful bidder having made good faith efforts. Competitors that fail to meet SBE goals and fail to demonstrate "good faith efforts" shall be deemed non-responsive to the city's SBE requirements and shall not be eligible to be awarded the contract. (d)  To ensure that all obligations under contracts awarded to SBEs are met, the city shall review the contractor's SBE involvement efforts during the performance of the contract. The contractor shall bring to the attention of the city any situation in which regularly scheduled progress payments are not made to SBE subcontractors. (Ord. No. 2009-78(09-O-1876), § 9, 12-15-09) 
Sec. 2-1373. - Penalties for noncompliance.     A contractor who fails to comply with any portion of this division, and whose failure to comply continues for a period of 30 calendar days after the contractor receives written notice of such noncompliance from the director of the office [of] contract compliance, shall be subject to any or all of the following penalties: (1)  Withholding of ten percent of all future payments for the eligible project until the office of contract compliance determines that the contractor is in compliance with this division. (2)  Cancellation of the eligible project. (3)  Refusal of all future contracts or subcontracts with the city for a minimum of one year and a maximum of five years from the date upon which this penalty is imposed pursuant to the provisions contained in Division 16 herein. (Ord. No. 2009-78(09-O-1876), § 9, 12-15-09) 
Sec. 2-1374. - Outreach to SBEs.     The City of Atlanta considers information dissemination and communication with SBEs as an integral part of the city's SBE program. As a part of its outreach program, the office of contract compliance will solicit input from representatives of SBEs, trade associations and community organizations. This input will serve several important functions, including: (1)  Providing information to identify additional SBE firms; (2)  Assisting in refining SBE program goals and procedures; and (3)  Providing an independent assessment of the effectiveness of the city's SBE program. (Ord. No. 2009-78(09-O-1876), § 9, 12-15-09) 
Sec. 2-1375. - Prime contracting guidelines. (a)  As early in the acquisition planning process as practicable, but no later than 30 days before the issuance of a solicitation, a procuring agency must coordinate with OCC when a procurement is valued over $5,000,000.00 in order to determine potential measures to be taken to maximize participation of SBEs in the procurement. (b)  If OCC believes that a proposed procurement will render SBE prime contract participation unlikely, then OCC shall recommend to the procuring agency alternative procurement methods which would increase SBE prime contract participation. Such alternatives may include: (1)  breaking up the procurement into smaller discrete procurements; (2)  breaking out one or more discrete components; and (3)  reserving one or more awards for sub-contracting procedures as set forth in section 2-1369. (c)  Where methods under subsection (b) are not feasible, OCC will work with the procuring agency to recommend a strategy that preserves SBE prime contract participation to the maximum extent practicable. OCC will also work to recommend that SBE participation is maximized through teaming arrangements and subcontracting opportunities as set forth in section 2-1369. (d)  Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to mandate increased participation of SBEs where such increased participation would significantly affect the ability of a user agency to complete a given project. (Ord. No. 2009-78(09-O-1876), § 9, 12-15-09) 
Sec. 2-1376. - Severability.     If any provision of this division or any application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of this article which can be given effect without the invalid provisions or applications, and are to this end declared to be severable. (Ord.

Sec. 2-1443. - Definitions.     The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:     African American shall mean persons having origins in any black racial group of Africa.     African American Business Enterprise (AABE) shall mean a business which is an independent and continuing enterprise for profit, performing a commercially useful function, which is owned and controlled by one or more African Americans.     African American Business Enterprise (AABE) small business enterprise shall mean an AABE that is also certified as an SBE under section 2-1363.     Asian Pacific American shall mean persons having origins in any of the original people of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent.     Asian Pacific American Business Enterprise (APABE) shall mean a business which is an independent and continuing enterprise for profit, performing a commercially useful function, which is owned and controlled by one or more Asian Pacific Americans.     Asian Pacific American Business Enterprise (APABE) small business enterprise shall mean an APABE that is also certified as an SBE under section 2-1363.     Atlanta Region shall mean the geographical area consisting of Barrow, Bartow, Carroll, Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, Coweta, DeKalb, Douglas, Fayette, Forsyth, Fulton, Gwinnett, Henry, Newton, Paulding, Pickens, Rockdale, Spalding, and Walton counties.     Bid shall mean a quotation, proposal, sealed bid or offer to perform or provide labor, materials, supplies or services to the city for a price on an eligible project, or for an eligible project that generates revenue for the city.     Bidder shall mean any individual, sole proprietorship, partnership, joint venture, or corporation that submits a bid to the city, or a vendor or contractor that has entered a contract with the city regarding an eligible project.     Certification or recertification shall mean official recognition and approval by the office of contract compliance that a business meets the qualification criteria of an AABE, APABE, HABE, or FBE, as set forth in this subdivision. Certification or recertification relates to qualifications regarding ownership, control, and the applicant's economic disadvantage, not the quality of the service or product.     Certified AABE, APABE, HABE, or FBE shall mean an AABE, APABE, HABE, or FBE which meets the requirements of section 2-1453 of this subdivision, and which has been approved by the office of contract compliance.     City shall mean the City of Atlanta.     Commercially useful function. For the purpose of determining whether a business enterprise is performing a commercially useful function, OCC shall consider all of the facts in the record, viewed as a whole, including without limitation the following: (1)  An MFBE performs a commercially useful function when it is responsible for execution of the work of the contract and is carrying out its responsibilities by actually performing, managing, and supervising the work involved. (2)  To perform a commercially useful function, the MFBE must be responsible, with respect to material and supplies used on the contract, for negotiating price, determining quality and quantity, ordering the material, and installing (where applicable) and paying for the material itself. (3)  To determine whether an MFBE is performing a commercially useful function, OCC will evaluate the amount of work subcontracted by the MFBE, industry practices regarding subcontracting, whether the amount the MFBE is to be paid under the contract is commensurate with the work it's actually performing, the MFBE credit claimed for its performance of the work, and other relevant factors. (4)  An MFBE does not perform a commercially useful function if its role is limited to that of an extra participant in a transaction, contract, or project through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of MFBE participation. In determining whether an MFBE is such an extra participant, OCC will examine similar transactions, particularly those in which MFBEs do not participate.     Control or controlled for the purpose of determining whether the owner or owners of a potential MFBE (as used in this definition, "MFBE-owner," which shall denote one or more owners) controls the potential MFBE, OCC shall consider all of the facts in the record, viewed as a whole, including without limitation the following: (1)  For an MFBE-owner to be deemed to control the potential MFBE, the potential MFBE must be independent. An independent business enterprise is a business whose viability does not depend on its relationship with another firm or firms. (a)  In determining whether a potential MFBE is independent, OCC will scrutinize relationships with other firms, in such areas as personnel, facilities, equipment, financial and/or bonding support, and other resources. (b)  OCC will consider whether present or recent employer/employee relationships between the MFBE-owner and other firms or persons associated with other firms compromise the independence of the potential MFBE firm. (c)  OCC will examine the potential MFBE's relationships with prime contractors to determine whether a pattern of exclusive or primary dealings with a prime contractor compromises the independence of the potential MFBE firm. (d)  In considering factors related to the independence of a potential MFBE firm, OCC will consider the consistency of relationships between the potential MFBE and other firms with normal industry practice. (2)  A potential MFBE firm must not be subject to any formal or informal restrictions which limit the customary discretion of the MFBE-owner. There can be no restrictions through corporate charter provisions, by-law provisions, contracts or any other formal or informal devices (e.g., cumulative voting rights, voting powers attached to different classes of stock, employment contracts, requirements for concurrence by persons other than the MFBE-owner, conditions precedent or subsequent, executory agreements, voting trusts, restrictions on or assignments of voting rights) that prevent the MFBE-owner, without the cooperation or vote of any other individual, from making any business decision of the business enterprise. This paragraph does not preclude a spousal co-signature on documents. (3)  The MFBE-owner must possess the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the business enterprise and to make day-to-day as well as long-term decisions on matters of management, policy and operations. (a)  An MFBE-owner must hold the highest officer position in the company (e.g., chief executive officer or president). (b)  In a corporation, the MFBE-owner must control the board of directors. (c)  In a partnership, the MFBE-owner must serve as a general partner, with control over all partnership decisions. (4)  Individuals who are not the MFBE-owner may be involved in an MFBE as owners, managers, employees, stockholders, officers, and/or directors. Such individuals must not, however, possess or exercise the power to control the business enterprise, or be disproportionately responsible for the operation of the business enterprise. (5)  The MFBE owners of the business enterprise may delegate various areas of the management, policymaking, or daily operations of the business enterprise to other participants in the firm, regardless of whether these participants are African American, Asian Pacific American, Hispanic American, or female. Such delegations of authority must be revocable, and the MFBE-owner must retain the power to hire and fire any person to whom such authority is delegated. The managerial role of the MFBE-owner in the business enterprise's overall affairs must be such that OCC can reasonably conclude that the MFBE-owner actually exercises control over the business enterprise's operations, management, and policy. (6)  The MFBE-owner must have an overall understanding of, and managerial and technical competence and experience directly related to, the type of business in which the business enterprise is engaged and the business enterprise's operations. The MFBE-owner is not required to have experience or expertise in every critical area of the business enterprise's operations, or to have greater experience or expertise in a given field than managers or key employees. The MFBE-owner must have the ability to intelligently and critically evaluate information presented by other participants in the business enterprise's activities and to use this information to make independent decisions concerning the business enterprise's daily operations, management, and policymaking. Generally, expertise limited to office management, administration, or bookkeeping functions unrelated to the principal business activities of the business enterprise is insufficient to demonstrate control. (7)  If state or local law requires the owner of a particular type of firm to have a particular license or other credential, then the MFBE-owner of that type of firm must possess the required license or credential in order to be deemed in control. If state or local law does not require an owner to have such a license or credential, OCC will not deny certification solely on the ground that the MFBE-owner lacks the license or credential. However, OCC may take into account the absence of the license or credential as one factor in determining whether the MFBE-owner actually controls the firm. (8)  OCC may consider differences in remuneration between the MFBE-owner and other participants in the business enterprise in determining whether the MFBE-owner controls the business enterprise. Such consideration shall be in the context of the duties of the persons involved, normal industry practices, the business enterprise's policy and practice concerning reinvestment of income, and any other explanations for the differences proffered by the business enterprise. OCC may determine that a business enterprise is controlled by its MFBE-owner although the MFBE-owner's remuneration is lower than that of some other participants in the business enterprise. In a case where someone other than the MFBE-owner formerly controlled the business enterprise, and the MFBE-owner now controls it, OCC may consider a difference between the remuneration of the former and current owner of the business enterprise as a factor in determining who controls the business enterprise, particularly when the former owner remains involved with the business enterprise and continues to receive greater compensation than the current MFBE-owner. (9)  In order to be viewed as controlling a business enterprise, an MFBE-owner cannot engage in outside employment or other business interests that conflict with the management of the business enterprise or prevent the MFBE-owner from devoting sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the business enterprise to control its activities. For example, absentee ownership of a business and part-time work in a fulltime firm are not viewed as constituting control. However, an MFBE-owner could be viewed as controlling a part-time business that operates only on evenings and/or weekends, if the MFBE-owner controls the business enterprise when it is operating. (10)  An MFBE-owner may control a business enterprise even though one or more of the MFBE-owner's immediate family members (who themselves are not African American, Asian Pacific American, Hispanic American, or female) participate in the business enterprise as a manager, employee, owner, or in another capacity. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, OCC must make a judgment about the control the MFBE-owner exercises vis-a-vis other persons involved in the business enterprise as it does in other situations, without regard to whether or not the other persons are immediate family members. If OCC cannot determine that the MFBE-owner, as distinct from the family as a whole, controls the business enterprise, then the MFBE-owner has failed to carry her/his burden of proof concerning control, even though s/he may participate significantly in the business enterprise's activities.     Eligible

The office of contract compliance shall accept complaints of alleged discrimination during the bid process regarding any participant in the bid process. Where the complaint of discrimination is specific to the procurement which is under consideration by the city, the office of contract compliance may investigate said complaint, determine its validity, and determine whether the actions complained of impact the bidder's responsiveness on the specific procurement. Allegations of discrimination based on events, incidents or occurrences which are unrelated to the specific procurement will be placed in the bidder's file maintained in the vendor relations database and handled in accordance with the procedure established in the city's vendor relations subdivision, section 2-1465, et seq. (2)  Determination of violation of EBO process.

In addition to the review described in section 2-1448(c), the office of contract compliance will conduct additional reviews of procurements that involve eligible projects for AABEs, eligible projects for APABEs, eligible projects for HABEs, or eligible projects for FBEs. In reviewing the documents submitted by a bidder on eligible projects for AABEs, eligible projects for APABEs, eligible projects for HABEs, or eligible projects for FBEs to determine whether the bidder has satisfied the good faith efforts requirement to subcontract with AABEs, APABEs, HABEs, or FBEs (as the case may be), the office of contract compliance will consider, among other things, the total project dollars subcontracted to or expended for services performed by other businesses, including certified AABEs, APABEs, HABEs, or FBEs, whether such businesses perform commercially useful functions in the work of the contract based upon standard industry trade practices, whether any amounts paid to supplier businesses are for goods customarily and ordinarily used based upon standard industry trade practices, and the availability of certified AABEs, APABEs, HABEs, or FBEs (as the case may be) within the relevant NAICS Codes for such contract. To assist prime contractors in this effort, the office of contract compliance shall set forth in the solicitation documents for the eligible project the availability of businesses, including certified AABEs, APABEs, HABEs, and FBEs within the relevant NAICS Codes for such eligible project. (1)  Database. The city will maintain a database identifying AABEs, APABEs, HABEs, or FBEs, that will include the types of services provided by the business enterprise and contact information for the business enterprise. A list from the database will be made available to bidders to assist them in their efforts to meet the requirements of the equal business opportunity subcontracting program. The list prepared from the database will specify which firms the City of Atlanta has determined to be certified minority and female business enterprises, in accordance with the City of Atlanta definitions for MFBEs. This list is not exhaustive. (2)  Minority and female business enterprise utilization. To ensure that the equal business opportunity subcontracting program achieves its purpose, the office of contract compliance will verify the AABE, APABE, HABE, or FBE certification status of each firm claiming such designation. Only certified AABEs, APABEs, HABEs, or FBEs (as the case may be) may be designated in reports as AABEs, APABEs, HABEs, or FBEs (as the case may be) for purposes of city projects. The percentage of AABEs, APABEs, HABEs, or FBEs (as the case may be) utilized by a bidder will be calculated by dividing the AABE, APABE, HABE, or FBE's price for providing direct labor or a bona fide service by the bidder's total dollars as identified in the bid. (3)  Equal business opportunity program compliance, monitoring and audit. The City of Atlanta reserves the right to conduct an audit of a bidder's work on eligible projects for AABEs, eligible projects for APABEs, eligible projects for HABEs, or eligible projects for FBEs to confirm the bidder's compliance with this equal business opportunity subcontracting program. (4)  Contract progress. The office of contract compliance shall require contractors on eligible projects for AABEs, eligible projects for APABEs, eligible projects for HABEs, and eligible projects for FBEs to complete and submit to OCC documentation regarding their utilization of AABEs, APABEs, HABEs, or FBEs (as the case may be), along with all other pertinent records required by OCC.

Subdivision II. - Vendor Relations 
Sec. 2-1465. - Short title.     This subdivision shall be known as the City of Atlanta's "Vendor Relations Ordinance." (Ord. No. 2009-78(09-O-1876), § 12, 12-15-09) 
Sec. 2-1466. - General policy.     The City of Atlanta has a need to maintain data on the performance of its vendors in order to ensure that purchases are made from, and contracts are awarded to, responsible prospective contractors only. The award of a contract to a contractor based on lowest evaluated price alone can be false economy if there is subsequent default, improper or exaggerated claims, late deliveries, or other unsatisfactory performance, resulting in additional contractual and administrative costs. While it is important that city purchases be made at the lowest price, this does not require an award to a contractor solely because that contractor submits the lowest offer. A prospective contractor must affirmatively demonstrate its responsibility, including, when necessary, the responsibility of proposed subcontractors.     The department of procurement has responsibility for making determinations of responsibility with input from the using departments and the office of contract compliance. In addition to information gathered about a bidder during the bid process, it is important that the city gather information regarding the responsibility of the contractor throughout the term of the contract, including without limitation data regarding the contractor's interactions with the city, and maintain said information in a central repository which is accessible to all city departments. It is the policy of the City of Atlanta to manage vendor relations proactively.     One aspect of responsibility is the vendor's compliance with the city's non-discrimination policy. It is the policy of the City of Atlanta not to discriminate, either directly or indirectly, against persons because of race, color, creed, religion, sex, domestic relationship status, parental status, familial status, sexual orientation, national origin, political affiliation, disability, age, gender identity or racial profiling. To that end, the city has the right to take any measures it deems appropriate to ensure that it is not a passive participant in public or private sector discrimination by the vendors with whom it contracts. (Ord. No. 2009-78(09-O-1876), § 12, 12-15-09)

The cost of the review appraisal report shall be shared equally by the city and the abutting property owner.

Such notice shall include a summary of the dog control officer's determination and shall state that the owner has a right to request a hearing from the animal control hearing board on the dog control officer's determination within seven days after the date shown on the notice; provided, however, that if an animal control hearing board has not been established for the jurisdiction, the owner shall be informed of the right to request a hearing from the probate court for such jurisdiction where the dog was found or confiscated within seven days after the date shown on the notice. The notice shall provide a form for requesting the hearing and shall state that if a hearing is not requested within the allotted time, the dog control officer's determination shall become effective for all purposes under this article. If an owner cannot be located within ten days of a dog control officer's determination that a dog is subject to classification as a dangerous dog or vicious dog, such dog may be released to an animal shelter or humanely euthanized, as determined by the dog control officer. (c)  When a hearing is requested by a dog owner in accordance with subsection (b) of this Code section, such hearing shall be scheduled within 30 days after the request is received; provided, however, that such hearing may be continued by the animal control hearing board or probate court for good cause shown. At least ten days prior to the hearing, the animal control hearing board or probate court conducting the hearing shall mail to the dog owner written notice of the date, time, and place of the hearing. At the hearing, the dog owner shall be given the opportunity to testify and present evidence and the animal control hearing board or probate court conducting the hearing shall receive other evidence and testimony as may be reasonably necessary to sustain, modify, or overrule the dog control officer's determination. (d)  Within ten days after the hearing, the animal control hearing board or probate court which conducted the hearing shall mail written notice to the dog owner of its determination on the matter. If such determination is that the dog is a dangerous dog or a vicious dog, the notice of classification shall specify the date upon which that determination shall be effective. If the determination is that the dog is to be euthanized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 4-8-26, the notice shall specify the date by which the euthanasia shall occur. (e)  Judicial review of the animal control hearing board's final decision may be had in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 15-9-30.9.

During the pendency of the appeal and any further appeals, the animal shall not be euthanized, provided that in the event the classification order is upheld at the conclusion of all appeals, the animal may be euthanized no earlier than 35 days after the final order upholding the classification if the owner does not obtain the required certificate of registration within 30 days after the date of the final order of court upholding the classification order. During the pendency of any such appeal by the owner, the animal shall not be released to its owner until the appeal is concluded and the certificate of registration is issued to the owner, if applicable. In such event, the animal will be housed at a licensed veterinarian's office or a licensed commercial kennel and the cost of such detention shall be borne by the owner of the animal. In the event the county appeals the court's order, the animal shall not be released to its owner until the appeal is concluded and the certificate of registration is issued to the owner, if applicable. In the event of an appeal by the county, the animal will be housed in the animal control shelter and the cost of such detention shall be borne by the county. ( Ord.
