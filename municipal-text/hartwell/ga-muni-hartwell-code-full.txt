PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Hartwell, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1989 Code, as supplemented through January 4, 2010, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1989 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

This publication was under the direct supervision of Sandra S. Fox, Code Attorney, and Daryl Jaquette, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

PART I - CHARTER AND LOCAL ACTS 
Subpart A - CHARTER[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note— The City of Hartwell, Georgia, was originally incorporated February 26, 1856, by 1855 Ga. Laws (Act No. 321), page 323. Printed herein is the most current Charter of the city, as adopted by 1992 Ga. Laws (Act No. 764), page 5476. The sequence of sections within each article are the same as in the act comprising it. Amendments to the Charter are indicated by history notes following amended provisions, except for 1957 Ga. Laws (Act No. 414), § 1, page 3128, which amended the Charter by directing that the word "city" be substituted throughout the Charter for the word "town." That substitution has been accomplished without history note. Otherwise, the absence of a subsequent history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original act. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. The title, enactment, severability, repealer, transitional, ratification, publication and effective date provisions have been retained, and where a section has been amended or repealed by a later provision, only the current language has been printed. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. 
State Law reference— Requirement for incorporation, dissolution, merger, or consolidation of municipalities by local act, O.C.G.A. § 36-35-2; standards for original incorporation, O.C.G.A. § 36-31-1 et seq.; limitations on local control by municipalities, O.C.G.A. §§ 36-34-1 et seq., 36-35-1 et seq.; amendment of municipal charters, O.C.G.A. §§ 36-35-3(b), 36-35-6; terms "city," "town," and "municipality" declared synonymous, O.C.G.A. § 36-30-1; municipal home rule, O.C.G.A. § 36-35-3; limitations on municipal home rule, O.C.G.A. § 36-35-6.

Sec. 16. - Sinking fund. 
The moneys received pursuant to an intergovernmental contract and the revenues, fees, tolls, charges, and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such revenues, fees, tolls, fines, charges, and earnings were produced by a particular project for which revenue bonds have been issued, unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the Authority to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds of the Authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture may provide, and such funds so pledged from whatever source received shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture, into a sinking fund, which said sinking fund shall be pledged to and charged with the payment of:

Sec. 17. - Remedies of bondholders. 
Any holder of revenue bonds or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by a resolution passed before the issuance of the revenue bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of this state, including specifically but without limitation, the "Revenue Bond Law," or granted hereunder or under such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this Act or by such resolution or trust indenture to be performed by the Authority or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, fines, and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished. 
Sec. 18. - Validation. 
Revenue bonds and the security therefor shall be confirmed and validated in accordance with the procedure of the Revenue Bond Law. The petition for validation shall also make party defendant to such action the state, and any institution, department or other agency thereof, and any county, municipality, school district, or other political subdivision or authority of this state which has contracted with the Authority for services or facilities relating to the project for which revenue bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated, and such defendant shall be required to show cause, if any exists, why such contract or contracts shall not be adjudicated as a part of the basis for the security for the payment of any such revenue bonds. The revenue bonds when validated and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such revenue bonds and the security for the payment thereof and interest thereon and against the Authority and all other defendants. 
Sec. 19. - Venue and jurisdiction. 
Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this Act or any suit or action against such Authority shall be brought in the Superior Court of Hart County, Georgia, and any action pertaining to validation of any revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall likewise be brought in said court which shall have exclusive, original jurisdiction of such actions. 
Sec. 20. - Interest of bondholders protected. 
While any of the revenue bonds issued by the Authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties, or existence of said Authority or its officers, employees, or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of such revenue bonds, and no other entity, department, agency, or authority will be created which will compete with the Authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such revenue bonds, nor will the state itself so compete with the Authority. The provisions of this Act shall be for the benefit of the Authority and the holders of any such revenue bonds and, upon the issuance of such revenue bonds under the provisions hereof, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such revenue bonds. 
Sec. 21. - Moneys received considered trust funds.

CHAPTER 26 - SIGN ORDINANCE[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2017-02, adopted Aug.7, 2017, repealed Ch. 26 in its entirety and enacted a new Ch. 26 to read as set out herein. Former Ch. 26, §§ 26-1—26-3, 26-25—26-28, 26-60—26-67, 26-93—26-96, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from the Code 1989, §§ 14.5-1—14.5-11, 14.5-22, 14.5-31—14.5-34, 14.5-41—14.5-44; Ord. adopted Oct. 2, 1989, §§ I—X; Ord. adopted May 1, 1990; Ord. adopted Jan. 3, 1995; Ord. adopted March 13, 1995. 

Sec. 26-1. - Purpose. 
Regulation of the location, size, placement, maintenance and certain other features of signs is necessary to enable the public to locate goods, services and facilities in the city without difficulty and confusion, to improve the general attractiveness of the community, to take advantage of the beauty of the community's natural and historic environment, and to protect property values therein. Accordingly, it is the intention of the city to establish regulations governing the display of signs which will: 
Protect property values, the local economy, and the quality of life by preserving and enhancing the appearance of the streetscape, which affects the image of the city. 
Promote and protect the public health, safety, and general welfare of the public. 
Promote the use of signs which are aesthetically pleasing and of appropriate scale in order to protect the character of Hartwell's historic residential and commercial districts. 
Restrict the clutter from excessive signs and lights which in turn promotes the free flow of traffic, and protects pedestrians and motorist from injury and property damage caused by, or which may be partially attributable to cluttered, distracting, and or illegal signage. 
Promote signs which are compatible with their surroundings. 
As these or any regulations can only establish the mechanical limits of signs and not enforce a level of visual quality in sign design, anyone planning a sign is strongly encouraged to consider: 
The character of the proposed sign, the audience for which the sign is to be designed, and the area where the sign will be located. The applicant is urged to think not only of the sign in and of itself, but also in terms of the effects such a sign will have upon the character of the surrounding area. 
The character of the sign structure, that is, the physical means of supporting the sign, and whether that structure could be made an integral part of a sign rather than a separate and frequently distracting element. 
To avoid illegal signage, anyone contemplating a sign is encouraged to contact the Building Official of the City of Hartwell, the Hartwell Downtown Development Authority, or a private firm or individual engaged in sign/graphic design for advice or assistance in the planning of such signage. For those contemplating signage within the historic district, the City of Hartwell Historic Preservation Commission may also provide guidance on the signage design requirements. 
(Ord. No. 2017-02, 8-7-2017) 
Sec. 26-2. - Boundaries.

(Ord. No. 2017-02, 8-7-2017) 
Sec. 26-10. - Sign measurements and placements. 
(a)  Sign height. The height of a sign shall be measured from the average natural grade at the base of the sign to the highest point of the sign face or structure, whichever is highest. The height shall not be measured from the top of an earth berm, support beam, or planting box. The ground level shall be the lower of the ground level existing at the time of construction or the ground level existing prior to construction or any earth disturbance at the site. No person shall artificially increase the maximum height of a sign by altering the grade at the base of the sign. 
(b)  Sign clearances. The sign clearance shall be measured from the bottom of the sign at any point, being the sign or the sign structure, whichever is lowest, vertically to the ground below. 
(c)  Sign face area. The sign face area shall be measured as described for each sign below: 
(1)  Monument signs. Monument signs shall be measured to the outside edge of the monument structure, from top to ground on signs with solid bases. Monument signs supported with columns shall be measured horizontally to the outer edges of the columns, and vertically from the upper edge of the sign face to the lower edge of the sign face. 
(2)  Sign cabinets. The area of sign faces enclosed in frames or cabinets is determined based on the outer dimensions of the frame or cabinet surrounding the sign face. 
(3)  Multiple cabinets. For freestanding and projecting signs that contain multiple cabinets on one structure and are oriented in the same viewing direction, the modules together are counted as one sign face. 
(4)  Individual element signs. When signs are constructed of individual elements or use individual painted or attached text, characters or symbols, as opposed to the sign text being on a sign cabinet or having a defined border, the sign area is determined by calculating the area of an imaginary rectangle drawn around the sign elements. 
(5)  Round signs (ball shaped). The maximum surface area visible at any one time of a round, three-dimensional, or three-sided or more sign is counted to determine sign area. 
(6)  Signs on a base material. When a sign is on a base material and attached without a frame, such as a wood board or Plexiglas panel, the dimensions of the base materials are to be used. 
(7)  Awnings and marquees. When signs are incorporated into awnings, the sign area is determined by computing the area of an imaginary rectangle drawn around the sign face. 
(8)  Asymmetrical, elliptical or irregular-shaped signs. The area shall be measured by drawing an imaginary rectangle around the total sign or sign elements as illustrated in figure 10.3.8. 

Figure 10.3.8
(9)  Circular. The allowed area of a sign shaped as a perfect circle shall be determined by using the formula: A = π × r 2 (π = 3.14) A = area r-radius: figure 10.3.9. 

Figure 10.3.9
(10)  Projecting signs. Projecting signs can project over a public right-of-way but no closer than two feet from a curbline and shall have a minimum clearance of nine feet of the finish grade of a sidewalk and 15 feet above any road, driveway or alley. No projecting sign or supporting structure shall extend above the top of a parapet wall. 
(11)  Backed (two-sided) signs. When the faces of a backed (two-sided) sign are parallel, or within ten degrees of parallel, only one side of the sign shall be counted for allowable signage. If the sign faces are not parallel, each is considered to be a separate sign face, and both faces are counted. See figure 10.3.11. 

Figure 10.3.11
(d)  Allowable sign placement. Certain signage shall be allowed for primary building walls (PBW) and secondary building walls (SBW) as specified in figure 10.4. The PBWs and SBWs are determined as follows: 
(1)  Primary building walls (PBW). The PBWs are those exterior walls of a structure which are oriented with most street frontage (visibility from the public right-of-way). PBWs can also include the exterior wall of a structure which does not necessarily have street frontage but which contains a public entrance and faces a parking area on site. Structures located on corner lots may have PBWs designated for each street front. 
(2)  Secondary building walls (SBW). The SBWs are those walls of a building that are not PBWs.

(a)  The city council hereby finds that, as provided throughout this City Code, including, but not limited to, in sections 36-150, 36-281(d), and 36-552 of this Code, when the owner of a property that is not adjacent to an existing utility distribution line requests that the city extend its utility line to such property, the City of Hartwell, Georgia, does not pay the costs of extending a utility distribution line in such circumstances. The city finds that this policy is sound and appropriate in the vast majority of cases. 
(b)  The city further finds, however, that notwithstanding any other limitation, restriction or requirement in this Code, if in the opinion of the city council, a particular proposed development would provide a significant economic development benefit to the citizens of Hartwell generally, and the benefits of such development exceed the costs of such extension, then the city shall be authorized, but not obligated, to pay some or all of the costs of extending certain utility distribution lines to the boundary of the property, as the city council may approve in each case. 
(c)  In assessing the economic development benefit of a proposed project, the city shall consider any and all probable economic development benefits that may accrue to the city, including, but not limited to, the quality and quantity of jobs created by such development, any impacts on tourism, the possibility that such development may attract other economic development or cause other projects or businesses to locate in the City of Hartwell or its vicinity, and such other factors that involve benefits to the general public, in the opinion of the city council. 
(d)  The city shall not be obligated to consider any proffered benefit if the city council determines, in the opinion of the city council, that such benefit is not reasonably probable. 
(e)  The city shall not be obligated to consider any proffered benefit if the city council determines, in the opinion of the city council, that such benefit is likely to accrue to only the owner or developer of the proposed project, the owner of the property where the project will be located, or a small group of persons, and not to the public generally. 
(f)  The city shall be authorized to require the owner or developer of a proposed project to satisfy such conditions as the city council may require before the city agrees to pay any such costs. These conditions may vary from project to project depending on the circumstances, and may include construction completion deadlines or milestones, job creation guaranties, utility usage guaranties, provision of bonds or letters of credit to secure any such agreements or guaranties, and such other conditions as the city council may decide to impose in a particular situation, in the opinion of the city council. Any such conditions shall be confirmed and memorialized in an enforceable contract between the city, the owner of the property, the developer, or such party or parties as the city deems appropriate. 
(g)  If the city determines to pay a portion or all of the costs of extending a utility line or lines in a particular case, then the city may pay only actual, reasonable, and bona fide costs of extending such line or lines, including, but not limited to, costs of acquiring any required right-of-way or easements, costs of construction, and costs of materials. 
(h)  Nothing in this article shall obligate the city to pay the costs of extending any utility lines or lines for a particular project or projects under any circumstances. The city retains discretion to act in these matters as the city council deems in the best interest of the city and its citizens. 
(i)  This article shall not apply to the costs of improvements within a residential subdivision, such as pavement, water and sewer lines, electrical power, and similar matters.

c.  If a meter as required under subsection (a)(2)a. or b. of this section shall not have been installed, or if at any time the installed meter stop accurately recording flows discharged into the sewage system, the user shall immediately install or repair the meter. For the first 90 days from the enactment of the ordinance from which this article is derived, that the meter is not installed or if installed, not accurately recording flow, the sewer charge will be based on the average percentage of flow calculated upon the previous three-month flow. If after 90 days the meter is not installed, or if installed is not operational, the sewer charge will be based on 100 percent of the volume of water purchased. If a sewer meter shows incorrect or suspected incorrect flows over four times in one 12-month period, then for the next 12-month period the sewer charge will be based on 100 percent of the volume of water purchased and will continue beyond the 12-month period until the time as it can be demonstrated to the city in a manner satisfactory to the city that the sewer meter is accurately measuring the sewerage flows. 
(3)  If any user (now discharging or proposing to discharge industrial waste into the POTW) does not secure his entire water supply requirements from the municipal waterworks system, the user shall install and maintain a meter on his waste line which discharge into the POTW or shall install the additional meter on the private water supply as required to permit determination of the total quantity discharged to the POTW from both sources under procedures comparable to those provisions in this chapter. 
(b)  All sources of water supply and all discharges of wastewater into the POTW must be identified in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Any omission shall be considered as an unauthorized use of the POTW. 
(c)  The user shall submit information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from each of the following: 
(1)  Regulated process streams; and 
(2)  Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e).

(5)  Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction or attaining final compliance; 
(6)  Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
(7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
(8)  Any other violation that the city manager determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
(Code 1989, § 10-92; Ord. of 10-2-1995, § 9) 
Sec. 36-416. - Enforcement remedies—Administrative. 
(a)  Notification of violation. When the city manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city manager may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within ten days of the receipt of the notice, the user shall submit to the city manager an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the city manager's authority to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(b)  Consent orders. The city manager may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. The documents will include the specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. The documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to the provisions in this article and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(c)  Show cause hearing. The city manager may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement to appear before the city manager or city council and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for the action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at least ten days prior to the hearing. The notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. At any hearing held pursuant to this article, testimony taken must be under oath and recorded. The transcript, so recorded, will be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing upon payment of the usual charges therefor. 
(d)  Compliance orders. When the city manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city manager may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(e)  Cease and desist orders. When the city manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirements, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the city manager may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all violations and directing the user to immediately comply with all requirements and take the appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(f)  Administrative fines and bonds. 
(1)  When the city manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city manager may fine the user in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00 per violation. The fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other longterm average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
(2)  Unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of one percent per month. A lien against the user's property may be sought for unpaid charges, fines and penalties. 
(3)  Users desiring to dispute the fines must file a written request for the city manager to reconsider the fine along with the full payment of the fine amount within 15 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the city manager may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, along with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The city manager may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. 
(4)  The city manager may require that a user causing or allowing a violation of any provision of this article furnish a bond or other security, with terms specified by the city, to hold harmless the city from any loss or expense that it may incur as a result of the violation or of any future noncompliance. 
(5)  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(g)  Emergency suspensions. The city manager may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever the suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge that reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The city manager may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
(1)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city manager may take the steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The city manager may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the city manager's satisfaction that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in subsection (h) of this section are initiated against the user. 
(2)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution, and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the city manager prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing. 
Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this subsection. 
(h)  Termination of discharge. In addition to other penalties provided in this article, any user that violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
(1)  A violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
(2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
(3)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge; 
(4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or 
(5)  Violation of the pretreatment standards in division 2 of this article. 
The user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the city manager shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (c) and (d) of this section. 
(c)  Notice. 
(1)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the city manager, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(2)  A user shall submit oral notice to the city manager of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain: 
a.  A description of the bypass and its cause; 
b.  The duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times; 
c.  If the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and 
d.  Steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the bypass. 
The city manager may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(d)  Criteria for approval. 
(1)  Where a bypass is prohibited, the city manager may take an enforcement action against a user, unless: 
a.  The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage; 
b.  There are not feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) of this section. 
(2)  The city manager may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the city manager determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (d)(1) of this section.

Sewer use surcharges will be applied for discharges having a five-day BOD greater than 300 mg/l, for discharges containing more than 300 mg/l of suspended solids, for discharges containing more than 20 mg/l of ammonia nitrogen, and for discharges that exceed maximum permitted volume. Where, in the city manager's opinion, the BOD does not provide a meaningful measurement of wastewater strength, the city manager may substitute COD limits and apply surcharges for wastewater having a COD greater than 600 mg/l. 
(1)  For the purposes of applying surcharges, it has been determined that the costs of operating the POTW can reasonably be subdivided into four components, as follows: 
a.  Flow related components including collection system elements, pumping facilities and hydraulic capacity at the treatment facilities, which together make up 20 percent of overall operating costs. 
b.  Oxygen demand components, including biological treatment process elements, which together make up 25 percent of overall operating costs. 
c.  Solids handling components, including clarifiers, digesters, drying beds and sludge disposal facilities, which together make up 35 percent of overall operating costs. 
d.  Ammonia nitrogen handling components including a portion of the biological treatment process elements, which together make up 20 percent of overall operating costs. 
_____ 
(2)  In any case where wastewater flow volume exceeds permit limits, or where the wastewater strength exceeds the surcharge limits established by this article, surcharge factors will be computed and applied to the user charges that would otherwise be due. Surcharge factors will be calculated for any or all components exceeding the surcharge limits, and individual components added together to produce a total surcharge factor to be applied as follows: 
a.  Where BOD is used with 24-hour composite samples: 

b.  Where COD is used with 24-hour composite samples: 

c.  Where BOD is used with a single grab sample: 

d.  Where COD is used with a single grab sample:

Service under this rate schedule is dependent upon the city's having the natural gas supply and capacity in excess of the existing requirements of higher priority customers. A customer without the ability to switch to an alternate fuel during periods when service must be interrupted, in order to maintain service to the city's higher priority customers, must either curtail its consumption of natural gas or be a subscriber to standby service. A customer under this rate schedule is required to execute a separate service agreement with the city. 
(c)  Monthly rate. The monthly charges for this service inside the city and outside the city shall consist of a fixed base service charge plus a volumetric rate, as follows: 
(1)  Base service charge. Each customer, regardless of the amount of gas consumed or purchased, and even if no gas is consumed or purchased, shall pay a service charge in an amount as established from time to time by city council resolution. 
(2)  Volumetric rate. In addition to the base service charge provided in subsection (c)(1) of this section, each customer shall pay for all gas consumed at a rate as provided for in a separate service agreement with the city, administered by the city manager. 
a.  Calculation. In general, the interruptible volumetric rate is determined monthly according to the rate calculation that all volumes consumed shall be charged at a rate per Mcf, which is the sum of the following components: 
1.  Underlying commodity charge. The first of the month Spot Market Index Price for gas delivered into Transco (50 percent of zone 3 price plus 50 percent of zone 4 price), as posted in "Inside FERC's Gas Market Report;" 
2.  Fuel recovery charge. Applicable fuel retention factor as posted in Transco's FERC approved tariff; 
3.  Interstate pipeline transportation charge. The currently effective market rate for interruptible transportation on Transco's interstate pipeline system; plus 
b.  City distribution charge. 

 
(d)  Minimum monthly charge. The minimum monthly charge shall be in an amount as established from time to time by city council resolution. 
(e)  Sales tax. State and local sales tax shall be added where applicable. 
(f)  Unauthorized use of gas. The city shall have the right at any time, following a one-hour notice, to interrupt or limit the quantity of gas it delivers to a customer under this rate schedule. If a customer refuses to honor the limitation notice, the customer shall pay all pipeline penalty charges incurred by the city for gas consumed, plus the cost of gas. The payment of a penalty charge shall not, under any circumstances, be considered as giving the customer the right to take unauthorized gas. 
(g)  Emergency gas. If a customer finds it impossible to continue operations on standby fuel because of a bona fide emergency during a limitation period, the city may at its sole discretion furnish emergency gas service, upon request, out of its storage or peak shaving facilities. The customer shall pay an amount as established from time to time by city council resolution multiplied by each Mcf delivered under emergency service, plus the cost of gas delivered. The city may discontinue this service at any time. 
(h)  Standby service. Interruptible customers without operational alternate fuel systems, and without the ability to curtail natural gas consumption when ordered by the city, may purchase seasonal firm capacity for each month, November through March. The standby service charge will be in addition to all rate components stated in subsection (c) of this section, and will generally be calculated as follows: 
The total standby service charge will equal the daily firm Mcf requirement of the customer multiplied by the market price of firm capacity/Mcf multiplied by five (the number of winter months November through March). The specific terms and conditions associated with this service will be established through a separate service agreement, which may vary from the general terms and conditions described in this article. 
(i)  Delivered gas service. Interruptible customers without operational alternate fuel systems, and without the ability to curtail natural gas consumption when ordered by the city, but which do not want to purchase standby service, can elect to purchase a delivered gas service. If a service is available at the time, the Municipal Gas Authority of Georgia will complete this transaction on behalf of the customer. The customer will be required to pay for all costs associated with the delivered gas service in addition to the city distribution charges listed in subsection (c)(2)b of this section for the gas. This service is available at the city's sole discretion, and may be cancelled at any time. 
(j)  Alternate fuel discount. In the event a customer desires to burn an alternate fuel in lieu of natural gas, the city may at its sole discretion discount the delivery charge stated in subsection (i) of this section. The customer must contact the city and provide adequate proof that the delivered price of its alternate fuel is less than the total monthly charge calculated in accordance with the rate structure contained in subsection (c) of this section and that natural gas consumption will be reduced if a discount is not offered.

d.  Intended plans for the provision of utilities, including water, gas, sewer and drainage facilities. 
e.  All streets shall be built to state DOT and the city standards and dedicated to the city upon completion and approval. All streets shall be named by developer and approved by the city. 
(7)  Future tract plan. In cases where a subdivision or planned unit development is to be developed in stages, with additional plats being filed with the planning commission at a later date, the filing of the initial plat will be accompanied by a future tract plan, a reasonably accurate plat in sketch form of the entire tract, which will show the future street system and topography for the entire tract. Once the required tract plan has been reviewed by appropriate city staff and given approval by the planning commission, seven copies of the approved future tract plan must be provided for distribution to the mayor and city council for their review and approval. 
(8)  Completeness. If any of the facts enumerated in subsections (1) through (7) of this section are omitted or misrepresented on the plat, the chairperson of the planning and zoning commission or the zoning administrator may refuse to review the plat and shall return the plat to the subdivider or developer to be completed or revised.

Sec. 42-530. - Same—Variances. 
The city is hereby empowered to authorize upon application in specific cases such variance from the dimensional requirements of zoning regulations (any provisions requiring a number to be achieved, such as height in feet, setback, lot area, lot width, parking and loading requirements, etc.) as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations will in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of these regulations shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. The existence of permitted or nonconforming use of neighboring land, buildings or structures in the same zoning district or of permitted or nonconforming uses in other districts shall not constitute a reason for the requested variance. A variance may be granted in an individual case of unnecessary hardship, after appropriate application in accordance with section 42-526, upon specific findings that all of the following conditions exist. The absence of any one condition shall be grounds for denial of the application for variance. 
(1)  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography that are not applicable to other land or structures in the same district; 
(2)  A literal interpretation of the provisions of these zoning regulations would create an unnecessary hardship and would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other property owners within the district in which the property is located; 
(3)  Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the property of the applicant any special privileges that are denied to other properties of the district in which the applicant's property is located; 
(4)  Relief, if granted, will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of these regulations and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or general welfare in such a manner as will interfere with or discourage the appropriate development and use of adjacent land and buildings or unreasonable affect their value; 
(5)  The special circumstances are not the result of the actions of the applicant; 
(6)  The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the land, building or structure; 
(7)  The variance is not a request to permit a use of land, building or structures that is not permitted by right in the district involved; and 
(8)  A variance shall not be granted in cases where the requested relief to the property owner can be remedied by a change to a zoning district which otherwise would not require a variance. 
(Ord. of 10-2-1995, § 86-1909) 
Sec. 42-531. - Procedures for appeals. 
(a)  The city council is empowered to hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the zoning administrator in the interpretation or enforcement of these zoning regulations. 
(b)  Such appeal shall be taken within 30 days, or as provided by city rules, by filing with the zoning administrator a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. All papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken shall forthwith be transmitted to the city. 
(c)  The city council shall select a reasonable time and place for the hearing of the appeal and give at least 15 days of public notice thereof and due notice to the parties in interest and shall render a decision on the appeal within a reasonable time. 
(d)  This section shall not be construed as permitting an appeal of the city's denial of a rezoning request or conditional use, the appropriate remedy of which would be a suit filed in the county superior court. 
(Ord. of 10-2-1995, § 86-1910) 
Sec. 42-532. - Simultaneous consideration of multiple applications. 
A petitioner may simultaneously submit multiple applications involving the same property, such as a rezoning request, conditional use, and variance. The planning commission and city council may simultaneously hear and consider multiple applications, provided the applicable public notice and other specified requirements are met. The proper order of consideration of multiple applications shall be the rezoning request first, conditional use second and variance third. The city council may consider and act upon a variance request at the same meeting as a rezoning request and/or conditional use is approved, in accordance with section 42-530. For multiple applications, specified filing fees shall be paid for each individual application, to defray the cost of newspaper advertisements and posting of signs on the subject property. 
(Ord. of 10-2-1995, § 86-1911) 
Sec. 42-533. - Conditional approval permitted. 
(a)  The letter of intent, site plan, and other information submitted as a part of any approved application for zoning map amendment, variance, appeal or conditional use, as well as any statements of intent made by the petitioner in public meetings recorded in the minutes of the body considering the application, shall be considered a part of the approval and must be followed. 
(b)  In addition to the conditions of following the submitted site plan, letter of intent and other assurances made by the petitioner, the planning commission may recommend, and the city council may attach, any conditions to its approval which it finds necessary to render the proposed development compatible with adjacent and nearby properties and land uses. 
(c)  Applications to modify the approved site plan, letter of intent or other conditions of approval may be considered by the city after review and recommendation by the planning commission, without the requirement of any public hearings. Any request, however, which in the zoning administrator's opinion constitutes a change that is tantamount to a new application that would otherwise require a rezoning, new conditional use or variance to articles and sections of this chapter not previously contemplated shall require resubmittal and reconsideration of the request as a new application that meets all submittal, notification and public hearing requirements specified in this chapter. 
(Ord. of 10-2-1995, § 86-1912) 
Sec. 42-534. - Notice and hearing required. 
(a)  This section shall apply to all applications for amendments to this chapter, amendments to the official zoning map, petitions for variances and appeals to the city council, and requests for conditional use approval. Except as otherwise noted, this section shall apply to the adoption and readoption of a zoning chapter and official zoning map. 
(b)  Upon receipt of a completed application, fees and other information required by this chapter, the zoning administrator shall cause notice of such application to be published at least one time in a newspaper of general circulation in the city council at least 15 days but not more than 45 days prior to the date of public hearing before the city. Said published notice shall include, as a minimum, the purpose, location, date and time of the public hearing before the planning commission and city council, the location of the property being considered, the present zoning classification of the property, and proposed action to be taken, as appropriate (such as proposed zoning district, type of conditional use, variance to particular articles and sections, and so forth). The zoning administrator shall also cause to have posted in a conspicuous place on said property one or more signs, each of which shall contain the information specified for published notices. The public hearing before the planning commission and the city shall not take place until said signs have been posted for a least 15 days but not more than 45 days prior to the date of the public hearing. The posting of signs shall not be required for appeals, since an appeal only applies to interpretation of zoning regulations that apply to all similarly situated properties. The city shall not require the posting of signs when adopting or readopting a zoning chapter and official zoning map. 
(c)  Public hearings may be delayed, rescheduled or continued at another time and date, provided announcement is given at the time and place of the initially scheduled and advertised public hearing, and provided such date, time and location of the public hearing to be delayed, rescheduled or continued is announced.

Sec. 42-535. - Recommendation—Zoning administrator. 
The zoning administrator may, as appropriate, customarily submit to the planning commission and city council, prior to a scheduled public hearing, copies of the site plan and letter of intent along with a written recommendation for approval, disapproval, deferral, withdrawal or other recommendation. Said recommendation shall include the reasons for said recommendation, considered within the context of the appropriate criteria as specified by this chapter. The zoning administrator's recommendation shall have an advisory effect only and shall not be binding on the city. Copies of the zoning administrator's recommendation shall be made available upon request to the applicant and other interested parties upon completion and distribution to the appropriate bodies and at the public hearing. 
(Ord. of 10-2-1995, § 86-1914)

(a)  Prior to the public hearing held by the city council, the planning commission shall hold a public hearing on all applications for amendment to the text of the zoning regulations, amendments to the official zoning map, conditional use applications and variances. The planning commission shall also provide a recommendation regarding adoption or readoption of a zoning chapter or official zoning map. 
(b)  After completing its studies of the particular petition, the planning commission shall submit a recommended action in writing to the city council. The planning commission may submit any additional report it deems appropriate. The planning commission's recommendation shall have an advisory effect only and shall not be binding on the city. Copies of the planning commission's recommendation and report shall be made available upon request to the applicant and other interested parties upon completion and distribution to the city council and at the public hearing before the city. 
(c)  The planning commission shall have 30 days within which to submit its recommendation. The city council shall not take action on any of said applications, until it has received the planning commission's recommendation within the specified time period; provided, however, that this shall not be construed to limit the city council from conducting its scheduled public hearing on the matter, should it desire to do so. If the planning commission fails to submit a recommendation within the 30-day period, it shall be deemed to have approved the recommended application. 
(Ord. of 10-2-1995, § 86-1915)

All interested parties after being recognized shall be afforded an opportunity to address the proposed application by standing before the appropriate body and stating their name, address and interest along with any comments on the proposed application. A time limitation may be imposed at the discretion of the presiding officer. 
(5)  The petitioner shall have an opportunity to answer any questions raised by the public, for summary remarks and for rebuttal concerning the proposed application. 
(6)  Upon the completion of any comments from interested parties and the petitioner, the public hearing shall be completed and adjourned.
