                  ____________ 
                  Published in 2012 by Order of the Jekyll Island-State Park Authority 
                    
                  Adopted: February 21, 2012 
                    
                  Effective: February 21, 2012 
                  ____________ 

                  OFFICIALS OF THE STATE PARK AUTHORITY OF JEKYLL ISLAND, GEORGIA AS OF MARCH 2012 
                  State Park Authority Members: 
                  Robert W. Krueger, Chairman 
                  Stephen B. Croy, Vice-Chairman 
                  Michael D. Hodges, Secretary 
                  Sybil D. Lynn 
                  Laura Lanier 
                  Buddy DeLoach 
                  A. Richard Royal 
                  Dr. Al Ike 
                  Mark Williams, Commissioner 
                  Georgia Department of Natural Resources 
                  ____________ 
                  C. Jones Hooks 
                  Executive Director 
                  This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Jekyll Island-State Park Authority of Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1981 Code and ordinances subsequently adopted by the authority. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1981 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been provided catchlines to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Index 
                  The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Daniel F. Walker, Code Attorney, and D. J. Heath, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

Unless another penalty is expressly provided, every person convicted of a violation of any provision of the Code or any ordinance, rule or regulation adopted or issued in pursuance thereof shall be punished in accordance with code Section 1-8. Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall continue or occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any Code section, whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the authority may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief and revocation of licenses or permits. 
                  Section 5 Additions or amendments to the Code when passed in such form as to indicate the intention of the authority to make the same a part of the Code shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments.

                  (b)	Exemptions. The tax imposed by subsection (a) of this section shall not be levied or collected upon the furnishing of any room or other unit of accommodation where such room or other unit of accommodation is contracted, prior to occupancy of the same, to be occupied for a period exceeding 30 consecutive calendar days by the same occupants; nor shall said tax be levied upon the furnishing of meeting rooms or units, provided that such meeting room or units are those normally and usually furnished for the purposes of meetings or other gatherings and are not those rooms or units designed and usually furnished for the purpose of providing a temporary dwelling. No tax shall be levied as provided in subsection (a) of this section upon the furnishing of any room or other unit of accommodation for a period of one or more days for use by state or local government officials or employees when traveling on official business. 
                  (c)	Persons liable for the tax. Every dealer furnishing any room or unit of accommodation to any person for value shall be liable for the tax thereon and for the collection, reporting and remittance thereof to the authority. 
                  (d)	Filing of reports. Every dealer liable for the tax imposed by subsection (a) of this section shall, on or before the 15th day of each calendar month, report to the authority, on forms furnished by the authority or on forms prepared by the reporting dealer and disclosing the same information, the following: 
                  (1)	The total number of rooms or other units of accommodation furnished during the preceding taxable period (i.e., the preceding calendar month), minus: 
                  a.	The number of rooms or other units of accommodation furnished to the same occupant or occupants for a period exceeding 30 consecutive calendar days pursuant to a contract (entered into prior to or simultaneous with the commencement of such occupancy) to rent said rooms or units of accommodation for such period; 
                  b.	The number of meetings rooms furnished; and

                  (4)	Such other information as may be required by the authority.
                  All such reports shall be made under oath and shall be signed by the reporting dealer or said dealer's agent, if any. 
                  (e)	Remittance of the tax. Every dealer liable for the tax imposed by subsection (a) of this section shall remit by the 15th day of each calendar month to the authority, with the report prepared and submitted pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, the tax shown due on said report for the preceding calendar month. Failure to so remit such tax shall cause said tax to become delinquent. 
                  (f)	Compensation of dealers. For the purpose of compensating the dealers for the reporting and remittance of the tax levied by this division, each such dealer shall be allowed three percent of the amount of the tax due and accounted for and remitted to the authority in the form of a deduction in submitting said dealer's report and paying the amount due as shown thereon; provided the amount due was not delinquent at the time of payment. 
                  (g)	Extensions; failures; deficiencies. The authority, for good cause may extend, for not to exceed 30 days, the time for making any reports required under the provisions of division. 
                  (h)	Penalties and interest. When any dealer shall fail to make any report to pay the full amount of the tax required by this division, there shall be imposed a specific penalty to be added to the tax due in the amount in accordance with the rate set by the State of Georgia; provided, however, if such failure is due to providential cause shown to the satisfaction of the authority in an affidavit attached to the report and remittance within ten days of the due date, such reports may be accepted exclusive of penalties and interest. In the case of a report which is deemed by the authority to be false or fraudulent or the failure to file a report, where, in the determination of the authority, willful intent exists to defraud the authority of any tax due under this division, a specific penalty of 50 percent of the tax determined to be due as hereinbelow provided shall be assessed. When any dealer fails to remit the tax, or any portion thereof on or before the day when such tax shall be required by this division to be paid, there shall be added to the amount due interest thereon at the rate in accordance with the rate set by the State of Georgia from the date due until the date paid, unless otherwise herein provided. All penalties and interest imposed by this division shall be payable and collectible by the authority in the manner as if they were a part of the tax imposed. 
                  (i)	Records. Every dealer required to make a report and pay any tax under this division, shall keep and preserve suitable records of the furnishing of rooms and/or units of accommodations, including such books of account as shall be necessary to determine the amount of tax due hereunder, and such other information relative to such furnishing as may be required by the authority. All such books and records shall be kept and preserved for a period of five years from the date of the tax due upon any furnishing and all such books and records shall be open to examination by the authority, its authorized agents and employees at all reasonable hours. 
                  (j)	Incorrect reports; failure to make reports; failure to pay tax; procedure. If any dealer required hereunder to file a report and pay the tax imposed hereby shall, for any taxable period, file a report which the authority has reason to believe is an incorrect report or shall fail to file a report or fail to pay the tax imposed hereby or any portion thereof, the authority shall, within a reasonable time following the date upon which, such report and tax was due, give written notice to such dealer of such failure and request such dealer to present to the authority at the authority's offices at a time designated in said notice all books, records, papers, and other information available to the dealer (hereinafter collectively referred to as "records") relating to such taxable period as the authority may reasonable require. Such dealer (or his agent under the provisions of subsection (m) of this section) may present such records and additional information, if any requested, by mail or in person and shall, at the time of such presentation, have full opportunity to present any other information he desires on the matter of his correct liability under this division. Based upon the examination of such records and additional information, or, in the event that such dealer shall have failed or refused to present the requested records and/or additional information, the authority is hereby authorized and required to make an assessment for the tax due, based upon such information as shall be available to the authority, and any such assessment shall be deemed prima facie correct. Notice of an assessment pursuant to this division shall be given in writing to such dealer by the authority and the tax assessed, together with penalties and interest thereon, if any, shall be due and payable to the authority immediately upon service of said notice. 
                  (k)	Remedies, collection of tax. The authority is hereby authorized to invoke such process and to avail itself of any and all such remedies as may now or hereafter be authorized by law to enforce this division and speedily to secure its revenues. Upon the failure of any dealer, after notice and an opportunity to be heard, pursuant to subsection (j) of this section to pay any tax assessed hereunder, the authority may proceed to collect the tax by any such authorized remedies, including but not limited to, execution and levy. Payment of any such assessment is also hereby made a prerequisite to the renewal of the dealer's innkeeper's or broker's license. 
                  (l)	Claim for refund. Any dealer who shall allege that any portion of tax collected hereunder has been erroneously paid or illegally collected may file a claim for refund with the authority, setting forth the amount alleged to have been paid erroneously or illegally or collected by the authority, a statement of the grounds upon which the dealer relies in making such claim, and any other information which the dealer may deem pertinent to such claim. If the dealer desires a hearing on the claim for refund, he shall so specify in the claim, and the authority shall provide a hearing within a reasonable time and shall appoint an officer of the authority to hear such claim. The hearing officer shall consider the information contained in the dealer's written claim, information presented by the claimant or his agent, and all information available to the authority which is known to the claimant. Based upon such information, the hearing officer shall recommend to the authority either that it approves or disapproves such dealer's claim in whole or in part. Based upon the recommendation of the hearing officer and, if the authority shall desire so to do, upon an independent examination by the authority of the written claim and upon any other information available to it, the authority shall either approve or disapprove the claim for refund and shall cause notice of its determination the reasons therefor to be given to the claiming dealer. Any refunds approved pursuant to the provisions of this division shall be paid from funds collected under this division within 30 days of the authority's determination to approve such claim. Dealers whose claims for refund have been disapproved by the authority shall have any and all remedies as may now or hereafter be authorized by law, including civil actions in the courts of the state. 
                  (m)	Dealers' agents. For purposes of the reporting and remittance of the tax imposed hereunder, each dealer may appoint an authorized agent and may delegate the reporting and remittance of the tax to such agent; provided, however, dealers appointing such agents shall notify the authority of the appointment of such agent and the name and address of such agent; and provided further that any dealer appointing such agent shall remain fully liable for the tax and for the reporting and remittance of such tax. 
                  (n)	Notices. All notices, statements, claims or demands, (collectively referred to as "notices") required or permitted to be given under the provisions of this division, shall be in writing and addressed as follows:

                  (a)	Construction hardware. All nails, bolts and construction hardware shall be of nonferrous or galvanized metal to prevent rusting in the salt atmosphere. 
                  (b)	Flashing material. All roof, window and through wall flashing shall be copper or copper back paper, aluminum or hot dipped galvanized metal. Untreated sheet metal will not hold up in a seaside location. 
                  (c)	Floor slabs on grade. Concrete floor slab on grade shall have waterproofed membrane under and should have a layer of gravel or cinders under to provide good drainage and to prevent moisture absorption. Concrete shall have integral-type waterproofing admixture. 
                  (d)	Termite and rot fungi protection. All substructure lumber shall be pressure creosoted, marine Celcure treated or other equal wood preservative treatment. All wood below the first floor ceiling line shall be wood preservative treated with dip method, pressure treatment method using a good toxic preservative equal to Celcure, or penta wood preservative. Further, wherever possible, metal termite shields shall be installed according to standard practice. (See FHA code). Drip edge shall be installed on all roof eves and gable ends to prevent roof drip from wetting or saturating boards or other trim lumber. Last two roof sheathing boards shall be pressure treated lumber. 
                  (e)	Paint trimming. All wood sash, wood exterior doors, wood screens or wood screen doors shall be wood preservative treated by one minute immersion method, using Armatol, Woodlife or penthachloraphenol crystals. After the treatment, they shall be primed thoroughly with white lead and oil before glazing and after-fitting. (Do not prime bottoms of doors and sash, leave unpainted for breathing.) 
                  (f)	Foundations. In nearly all cases spread-type footings of concrete will be satisfactory. Because of the possibility of varying soil load capacities (soft spots) it is recommended that longitudinal reinforcing be added to the footings. Footings for large and heavy buildings shall be designed after making soil load bearing test. 
                  (g)	Best Management Practices for use of Exterior Insulation and Finishing Systems (EIFS) or other expanded-polystyrene (EPS) construction practices. Any project that involves Exterior Insulation and Finishing Systems (EIFS) or otherwise utilizes expanded polystyrene (EPS, a.k.a. "Styrofoam") in any element of construction shall follow these specifications. If EPS materials are to be rasped, sanded, sawn, planed or otherwise worked in a way that produces loose debris of any size, all of the following measures shall be implemented. 
                  (1)	Any rasping equipment shall be equipped with a vacuum.
                  (2)	The area around the activity shall be shielded on all sides, from six feet above the area being worked to ground level with construction netting to capture any loose debris. 
                  (3)	At least one vacuum in addition to any vacuum rasps shall be on site with someone assigned to use it to immediately clean up any EPS debris that is not captured by the vacuum rasps. 
                  (4)	The contents of all vacuum equipment shall be emptied into sealable, disposable bags before being disposed of in any open containers to prevent wind dispersal of debris after it has been disposed of in open top dumpsters or other containers. 
                  (5)	EPS debris or scrap too large to be vacuumed shall be disposed of immediately in sealed bags or enclosed containers to prevent it from being broken into smaller pieces and dispersed off site. 
                  (6)	Any activities not in compliance with these specifications will be stopped until the specifications of this section are satisfied. Any EPS debris on the construction site or escaping the construction site, regardless of the implementation of these specifications, will be the responsibility of the contractor to clean up immediately and completely.

                  (m)	The fire protection fee shall be exclusive of and in addition to any and all other fees, rents and payments made to the authority, and without limitation of the foregoing, shall be separate from and in addition to any public safety service fee that is either currently charged or may in the future be charged.

The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: accessory structures are not exempt from any chapter requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank.

                  (1)	The term "substantial improvement" means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. The market value of the structure should be: 
                  a.	The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or 
                  b.	In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring.
                  The term "substantial improvement" includes structures, which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the structure commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. 
                  (2)	The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include either:
                  a.	Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to ensure safe living conditions; or 
                  b.	Any alteration of an historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.

                  Sec. 14-3. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)	The flood hazard areas of the island are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)	These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. of 2-1-1988, art. 1, § B)
                  Sec. 14-4. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)	Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities or erosion; 
                  (3)	Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)	Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)	Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  ARTICLE III. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 14-89. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)	New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)	New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)	New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; according to principles of construction for coastal areas (FEMA 55) with no adverse impact upon the community; 
                  (4)	Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater (not applicable in coastal high hazard areas): 
                  a.	Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.	Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.	The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and
                  3.	Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction. 
                  b.	So as not to violate the lowest floor criteria of this chapter, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.	The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms; 
                  (5)	All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
                  (6)	Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces; 
                  (7)	New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
                  (8)	New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
                  (9)	On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
                  (10)	Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this chapter, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
                  (Ord. of 2-1-1988, art. 4, § A)
                  Sec. 14-90. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard designated as A1—30, AE, AH and A (with estimated BFE) zones, the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)	New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 14-89(4), elevated buildings. All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing and other service facilities shall be elevated, at or above, one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)	Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1—30, AE or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth in this subsection and in section 14-65(7). 
                  (3)	Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.	All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on:
                  1.	Individual lots or parcels;
                  2.	In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions;
                  3.	In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or
                  4.	On a site in an existing manufactured home parks or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood; 
                  must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.	Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an either existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that: 
                  1.	The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.	The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.	All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Reference section 14-89(6).) 
                  d.	All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
                  1.	Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
                  2.	Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.	The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections (3)a and c of this section. 
                  (4)	Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 14-7, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.	Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.	Only if subsection (4)a of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article. 
                  (Ord. of 2-1-1988, art. 4, § B)
                  Sec. 14-91. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A zones). 
                  (a)	Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 14-7, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)	When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 14-7, then the floodplain manager shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this article. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall apply. 
                  (2)	No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)	In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (Note: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed.) Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 14-89(4), elevated buildings. All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  (b)	The floodplain manager shall require certification of the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (Ord. of 2-1-1988, art. 4, § C)
                  Sec. 14-92. - Standards for areas of special flood hazard (AE zones) with established base flood elevations without designated floodways. 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 14-7, where streams with base flood elevations are provided but no floodways have been designated, (AE zones) the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)	No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 
                  (2)	New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or floodproofed to elevations established in accordance with section 14-89 
                  (Ord. of 2-1-1988, art. 4, § D)
                  Sec. 14-93. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). 
                  Areas of special flood hazard established in section 14-7, may include designated AO zones, shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
                  (1)	All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 14-89(4), elevated buildings. The floodplain manager shall require certification of the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (2)	New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions in this section, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth in this subsection and as required in section 14-64(b)(1)c and (b)(2). 
                  (3)	Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure. 
                  (Ord. of 2-1-1988, art. 4, § E)
                  Sec. 14-94. - Coastal high hazard areas (V zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 14-7, are areas designated as coastal high hazard areas (V zones). These areas have special flood hazards associated with wave action and storm surge, therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (1)	All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be located 200 feet landward of the reach of mean-high tide; 
                  (2)	All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be elevated on piles, columns, or shear walls parallel to the flow of water so that the bottom of the lowest supporting horizontal structural member (excluding pilings or columns) is located no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation level. All space below the lowest supporting member shall remain free of obstruction or constructed with nonsupporting breakaway walls. Open wood lattice work or decorative screening may be permitted for aesthetic purposes only and must be designed to wash away in the event of abnormal wave action and in accordance with subsection (6) of this section; 
                  (3)	All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be securely anchored on pilings, columns or shear walls; 
                  (4)	All pile and column foundations and the structures attached thereto shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the combined effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components, both (nonstructural and structural). Water-loading values shall equal or exceed those of the base flood. Wind loading values shall be in accordance with the technical codes adopted by the authority; 
                  (5)	A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design, specifications and plans for construction are in compliance with the provisions contained in subsections (2), (3) and (4) of this section; 
                  (6)	All space below the lowest horizontal supporting member must remain free of obstruction. Open wood lattice work or decorative screening may be permitted for aesthetic purposes only and must be designed to wash away in the event of abnormal wave action without causing structural damage to the supporting foundation or elevated portion of the structure. The following design specifications are allowed: 
                  a.	No solid walls shall be allowed;
                  b.	Material shall consist of open wood lattice or mesh screening only; and
                  c.	If aesthetic open wood lattice work or screening is utilized, any enclosed space shall not be used for human habitation, but shall be designed to be used only for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. 
                  (7)	Prior to construction, plans for any structures having open wood latticework or decorative screening must be submitted to the authority board for approval; 
                  (8)	Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to any structure shall not enclose the space below the lowest floor except with open wood latticework or decorative screening, as provided in this section; 
                  (9)	There shall be no fill used as structural support. Noncompacted fill may be used around the perimeter of a building for landscaping/aesthetic purposes provided the fill will wash out from storm surge, (thereby rendering the building free of obstruction) prior to generating excessive loading forces, ramping effects, or wave deflection. The authority landscape superintendent shall approve design plans for landscaping/aesthetic fill only after the applicant has provided an analysis by an engineer, architect and/or soil scientist, which demonstrates that the following factors have been fully considered: 
                  a.	Particle composition of fill material does not have a tendency for excessive natural compaction; 
                  b.	Volume and distribution of fill will not cause wave defection to adjacent properties; and 
                  c.	Slope of fill will not cause wave run-up or ramping;
                  (10)	There shall be no alteration of sand dunes or mangrove stands, which would increase potential flood damage; and 
                  (11)	Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes), except in an existing manufactured homes park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of subsection (4) of this section are met.

                  Sec. 14-95. - Standards for subdivisions. 
                  (a)	Standards for subdivisions are as follows:
                  (1)	All subdivision and/or development proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
                  (2)	All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
                  (3)	All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and 
                  (4)	For subdivisions and/or developments greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less, base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions. 
                  (b)	Any changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted to FEMA for review as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. Upon completion of the project, the developer is responsible for submitting the as-built data to FEMA in order to obtain the final LOMR.

                  ARTICLE IV. - VARIANCES 

                  Sec. 14-121. - Procedures. 
                  (a)	The authority board shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (b)	The authority board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the floodplain manager in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
                  (c)	Any person aggrieved by the decision of the authority board may appeal such decision to the county probate court as provided in the Official Code of Georgia Annotated (O.C.G.A.). 
                  (d)	Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)	Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)	Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)	In reviewing such requests, the authority board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
                  (h)	Conditions for variances:
                  (1)	A variance shall be issued only when there is:
                  a.	A finding of good and sufficient cause;
                  b.	A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.	A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)	The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)	The floodplain manager shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)	Upon consideration of the factors listed in this section and the purposes of this chapter, the authority board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

                  (c)	It is suggested that while the surveyor is doing this work that he be instructed to take the existing grades on the property, adjoining street elevations and location of important trees, and from this data provide the lessee and his architect with a plot plan showing this information.

                  (c)	It is important that the finish grade of the property be kept at a sufficiently high level (even at the necessity of having to do considerable filling) to ensure good surface drainage away from the building and from the property, to prevent flooding in periods of heavy rainfall, and to ensure efficient operation of septic tanks and grease trap drain lines during periods when the water table is normally high. Care shall be taken to prevent surface drainage from entering upon adjacent property. 
                  (d)	The first floor level should be set sufficiently high as to ensure that there is no possibility of damage from excessive dampness or even flooding during period of heavy rainfall. This is particularly important on houses which have a solid concrete slab-on-grade for the first or main floor.

The selection of the proper size septic tank and correct quantity of drain tile shall normally be selected from the table based upon the number of persons living in the house or reasonably contemplated to live in the house. Unusual conditions encountering soil with poor permeability or high water table may require special design after making the proper soil analysis test. 
                  (3)	Waste from ordinary kitchen sinks shall be carried through a grease trap into separate drain tile field. Standard grease traps and accessories are likewise included in these approved designs. 
                  (4)	Waste from laundry equipment and from kitchen garbage disposal devices will necessitate specially designed sewerage disposal facilities.

However, the applicant may neither supplement nor amend its application within said ten-day period except at the invitation of the authority. Any attempt to do so sua sponte shall be deemed a separate and new application. 
                  (c)	The executive director of the authority may deny the application for a permit upon any of the following reasons or combination of reasons: 
                  (1)	The application does not contain all required information, or that information set out is so incomplete, vague, or ambiguous as to prevent full and proper review by the authority; 
                  (2)	The application contains material omissions, falsehoods, or misrepresentations;
                  (3)	The applicant or entity represented by applicant is incompetent to contract, sue, or be sued; 
                  (4)	The person applying lacks authority to represent the entity for which the application is made; 
                  (5)	The applicant or entity represented by applicant has on prior occasions damaged public property, or has not paid in full for such damages, or is in arrears as to any judgment civil, criminal, or administrative rendered against the applicant or entity, or is in violation of any injunction or restraining order entered against the applicant or entity, whether under the same name or another; 
                  (6)	The applicant or entity represented by applicant has on prior occasions violated permitting ordinances in connection with events of a substantially similar nature; 
                  (7)	The plan of the event as proposed is likely to present an unreasonable danger to the health or safety of participants in the event or other members of the public (though not through the agency of any predicted reaction by onlookers or members of the public); 
                  (8)	The plan of the event as proposed is likely to unduly restrict and/or congest traffic (vehicular or pedestrian) on any of the public roads, rights-of-way, sidewalks or waterways in the immediate vicinity of such event; 
                  (9)	The plan of the event as proposed is likely to constitute an unreasonable disturbance of the peace, or would unreasonably burden lawful commerce in the area at the time of the proposed event, or would unreasonably intrude upon the privacy or property of citizens in the area of the proposed event (though not through the agency of any predicted reaction by onlookers or members of the public); 
                  (10)	The plan of the event as proposed includes activities which are prohibited by laws of the United States, the state, or ordinances of the city, county or the authority, or activities which constitute nuisance or tortuous conduct with respect to public or private property or persons; 
                  (11)	The plan of the event as proposed would conflict with previously planned programs or events organized and conducted by the authority and previously scheduled for the same time and place; 
                  (12)	The plan of the event as proposed is prohibited by or is inconsistent with the classifications and uses of the proposed or desired location; or 
                  (13)	A fully executed prior application for permit has been or will be granted to a prior applicant authorizing uses or activities which do not reasonably permit multiple occupancy of that particular space. 
                  (d)	It is the specific intent of the authority in enacting this article to regulate only the time, place and manner of events and not to regulate the content or message of any speech or expressive conduct. The factors which the authority finds express and support the substantial and compelling interests of the authority in the preservation of the rights and liberties of its citizens and the safety, health, and good order of its society, are the only bases upon which the executive director of the authority shall decide to issue or deny a permit applied for hereunder, and no such decision shall be made or justified based upon the anticipated or predicted content of the speech or expressive conduct of any applicant.

                  (b)	The written appeal must state succinctly the grounds upon which it is asserted that the determination should be modified or reversed and shall be accompanied by copies of the application for permit, the written notice of determination to which appeal is being made, and any other papers relevant to the denial of the permit. 
                  (c)	Within seven days of the receipt of a written appeal, the board secretary shall set a hearing date.

                  Sec. 20-47. - Authority property. 
                  It shall be unlawful for any person or entity to convert public authority property to private use unless specific written authorization from the authority has first been had and obtained. This prohibition shall include, but not be limited to, easements, rights-of-way and authority land not under lease to an individual. 
                  (Code 1981, § 11-101)
                  Sec. 20-48. - All property held in trust. 
                  Each lease of property on the island is granted and accepted with the express understanding that the island is held in trust by the authority for park purposes and that any use of the premises or buildings or any conduct or activity of any occupant of any premises or buildings, which, in the opinion of the authority, is inconsistent with such trust is strictly prohibited. 
                  (Code 1981, § 11-102)
                  Sec. 20-49. - All property subject to Jekyll Island-State Park Authority Act. 
                  Each lease of property on the island is granted and accepted subject to all the terms and conditions of the Jekyll Island-State Park Authority Act, as amended, at the time of execution. As provided in the Jekyll Island-State Park Authority Act ("Act"), the leasing activity of the authority is the business activity of the authority from which it shall gain revenues to support and maintain and develop and beautify the island and to furnish the people of the state with as much free, nonprofit or subsidized recreation as may be possible. Under the Act the leasing activity is but an instrumentality through which the public services are to be accomplished and for this reason this activity must always be subservient to the ultimate public service objectives of the Act. These conditions and limitations of leasing island property, which have not been reduced to restrictions and recorded on the various plats of the leased property, relate to general day to day use of the property by lease occupants and their conduct generally considered in the light of the purposes of the creation of the authority. Both the purpose and the scope of these conditions and limitations make it impractical to attempt to set forth in a definite form a specific, separate statement of each act prohibited, but all may be easily understood and encompassed by the following general rules: 
                  (1)	Each occupant of property on the island shall use and enjoy that property he has the right to occupy and cause all guests and visitors and friends to use and enjoy the same in such a manner as not to conflict with the use of enjoyment of the park areas by the general public and the other several leased areas by the several other occupants in those areas. Every normal and usual recreational and social use may be made of all residential properties and every usual and acceptable and licensed business use may be made of the properties leased specifically for business purposes, but no lewd, licentious or illegal use shall be made of such property. 
                  (2)	It shall be the responsibility of the occupants of any lot or parcel of lease property upon the island to preserve and maintain the cleanliness, orderliness and good appearance of the property which they occupy. No unclean, unsightly or unkempt conditions of buildings or grounds which shall tend to destroy the beauty of the island as a whole or the specific area will be permitted. Furthermore, no occupant of the lease property upon the island shall through his activity destroy or detract from the cleanliness, orderliness or beauty of the island or each areas by placing or leaving therein or thereon debris or refuse or unsightly objects of any kind, it being understood that each occupant has not only the duty of maintaining the cleanliness, orderliness and beauty of the lot or parcel he may occupy, but also has the further duty of not defacing or in anywise detracting from the beauty of the remainder of the island. 
                  (3)	Every occupant of the leased property shall be responsible for conducting himself in a fashion consonant with the use and purposes of the entire island. Furthermore, no occupant shall maintain any plants or animals or keep or operate any device or thing of any sort whose normal activities or existence is in any wise noxious, dangerous, unsightly, or of a nature as will necessarily diminish or destroy the enjoyment of other occupants or the general public at any point throughout the island. 
                  (Code 1981, § 11-103)
                  Sec. 20-50. - Applicable law. 
                  All violations of the conditions and limitations set forth in section 20-49 shall be dealt with in accordance with the laws of the state and the ordinances of the county and any and all ordinances of the authority.

                  Sec. 20-51. - Applicable restrictions, conditions, limitations, easements, rights, privileges, etc. 
                  All property on the island, both residential and business, is subject to certain restrictions, conditions, limitations, easements, rights, privileges, etc., as recorded in the office of the clerk of superior court of the county on December 27, 1954, in book 7-Q, page 361.

                  Sec. 20-52. - Lease information. 
                  (a)	The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Trade secrets includes information of a privileged or confidential nature, whether the nature of such information is financial or otherwise. 
                  (b)	Upon the reasonable request of the executive director, all lessees and tenants of the authority whose leases or rental agreements pertain to the operation of a business on the island shall submit information pertaining to the business to the authority even though such information may constitute trade secrets.

                  Branch collar means the swelling where a branch joins the trunk of a tree. The callus that forms the collar is an area of tissue that contains a chemically protective zone which helps the tree heal after pruning. 
                  Buildable area means that portion of a site, exclusive of the minimum required yard (setback) areas and the building site, on which a structure or building may be erected. The term "buildable area" also means the portion of a parcel of land where a building may be located and which shall contain enough square footage to meet the minimum required by the zoning district. The portion which is not located in the minimum setbacks, utility corridors, driveways, slopes to build streets, tree save areas, landscape strips, specimen tree areas, wetlands, stormwater and sanitary sewer easements. 
                  Building means any structure built for the support shelter or enclosure of persons, animals, chattel or property of any kind. 
                  Building site means that portion of a lot which is occupied by a building or that portion of a site which is proposed to be occupied by a building and for which a building permit has been issued. 
                  Caliper means the standard for trunk measurements of nursery stocks. The caliper of the trunk shall be taken at breast height (4½ feet) above the ground. 
                  Critical root zone means the area of tree roots within the crown drip line. The zone is generally defined as a circle with a radius extending from a tree's trunk to a point no less than the furthest crown drip line. Disturbances within this zone will directly affect a tree's chance for survival. 
                  Crown drip line means a vertical line extending down to the ground from the end of a tree's longest branches. 
                  Damage or abuse means any action, which does not follow good arboricultural practices. The term "abuse" also includes excessive pruning, which significantly alters the aesthetic appearance or endangers survivability of the tree, damage inflicted upon roots by machinery, changing the natural grade above the root system or around the trunk, and changing drainage patterns. 
                  Density factor for the site (DFS) means a unit of measure used to prescribe and calculate required tree coverage on a site. Unit measurements are based upon tree size at dbh. 
                  Diameter at breast height (dbh) means the diameter of a tree, measured at breast height (4½ feet) above the ground. If a tree splits into multiple trunks below 4½ feet, the diameter of each trunk shall be measured individually and added together. 
                  Drip line means an imaginary vertical line that extends downward from the outermost branches of a tree to the ground. 
                  Historic tree means any tree species which has a diameter at breast height (dbh) of 24 inches or larger. Typically any tree species of this diameter is at least 50 years of age or older, however this can vary greatly depending upon the type of tree species and microclimate which it is growing in. 
                  Land disturbing activity means any activity which may result in soil erosion from water or wind and movement of sediments into state water or onto lands with the state, including, but not limited to, clearing, dredging, grading, excavating, transporting, and filling of land. 
                  Live oak tree means any live oak (Quercus virginiana) that has a diameter at breast height (dbh) of two inches or larger. 
                  Lot means a plot or parcel of leased land considered a unit, devoted to a certain use or occupied by a building or group of buildings permitted in the chapter 16, zoning, and having its principal frontage upon a street or access in accordance with municipal regulations, and the customary accessories and open spaces belonging to the same. 
                  Protected trees means any living, self-supporting woody perennial plant which has a diameter at breast height (dbh) of four inches or larger is defined as a tree. Also, any live oak (Quercus virginiana) that has a diameter at breast height (dbh) of two inches or larger. 
                  Protective barricade means a physical structure not less than four feet in height, limiting access to protected and significant trees. A suitable protective barrier shall be composed of wood or other durable material, which insures protection of significant and protected trees during development and/or construction improvements (see figure 1 in section 20-95). 
                  Removal of trees means any intentional or negligent act which will cause a tree to decline and die, including, but not limited to, such damage inflicted upon the root system of a tree by application of toxic substances, the operation or filling above the root system or around the trunk of a tree, pruning, and damages from injury or fire inflicted on trees which result in or permit pest infestation. 
                  Replacement tree means any tree that is planted in order to replace an existing tree which must be removed. Replacement trees must have a minimum diameter at breast height (dbh) of 2½ to three inches in caliper. Multitrunk trees must have a minimum size of ten to 12 feet. The tree inspector may require a larger size based on the size and value of the tree to be replaced. 
                  Root collar means the point of attachment of major woody roots to the tree trunk, usually at or near the ground line and associated with a marked swelling of the tree trunk. 
                  Root respiration means an active process occurring throughout the feeder root system of trees and involving the consumption of oxygen and sugars with the release of energy and carbon dioxide. Root respiration facilitates the uptake and transport of minerals and nutrients essential for tree survival. 
                  Site means any plot, lot, parcel or tract of land within the jurisdiction of this article. 
                  Soil compaction means a change in soil physical properties which includes an increase in soil weight per unit volume and a decrease in soil pore space. Soil compaction is caused by repeated vibrations, frequent traffic and weight. As related to tree roots, compacted soil can cause physical root damage, a decrease in soil oxygen levels with an increase in toxic gasses, and can be impervious to new root development. 
                  Specimen tree means a tree which is designated upon approval by the tree inspector, a certified arborist or authorized agents to be of notable historical value or interest because of its age, size, historic association or unique aesthetic value. The tree must be in good or fair condition (see section 20-95) in order to merit this designation. All specimen trees permitted to be removed will require a 3:1 caliper-inch replacement. 
                  Topping means a practice of cutting back the entire crown of mature trees to stubs. It is a destructive pruning practice that is stressful to mature trees, and may result in reduced vigor, decline or even death of a tree. In addition, new branches that form below the cuts are only weakly attached to the tree, and are in danger of splitting out. 
                  Tree inspector means the tree inspector for the authority, or his designee. The individual or entity having the primary responsibility to administer and enforce the standards set forth in this article. The landscape superintendent or code enforcement officer shall serve as the tree inspector or assigned designee during an absence. 
                  Tree mitigation fund means that in lieu of planting mitigation trees on the leased site, payment may be made as fair compensation for replacement of trees. Revenue collected in this fund will be used to support tree planting and tree maintenance throughout the island. 
                  Tree replacement schedule means a plan showing the location, species and sizes of all replacement trees. 
                  Tree save area means all areas designated for the purpose of meeting tree density requirements, saving specimen trees and/or preserving natural buffers. 
                  Yard area means that portion of any site covered by the front, side and rear yard areas as established by the minimum setback requirements in chapter 16, zoning for respective zoning district classifications.

Written notification shall indicate the nature of the violation and/or the action necessary to correct the violation. 
                  (b)	The issuance of a building permit and the failure to substantially erect building improvements within 12 months combined with removal of trees in the buildable area and the building site shall be deemed as a violation of this article. Each tree removed shall be identified as a separate offense. 
                  (c)	Any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this article or fail to comply therewith, shall for each such failure or violation or noncompliance shall subject to a fine not to exceed $50.00 per day or shall be provided and stipulated by law. Each tree removed or destroyed in violation of this article represents a separate offense. In addition, the property owner committing the violation shall replace the tree removed by the replacement guidelines of this article. This could consequentially result in land lease default. 
                  (d)	Any person, firm, organization, society, association or corporation, or any agent or representative thereof who commits, participates, or assists in such violation may each be found guilty of a separate offense and suffer the penalties herein provided.

                  The regulations set forth herein shall apply to all real property within the state park limits now and in the future subject to the following exemptions: The mitigation of wetlands pursuant to a permit or approved plan from, and the requirements of, the state department of natural resources or Army Corps of Engineers shall be exempt from the provisions of this article. 
                  (Ord. of 1-13-2010, § 3)
                  Sec. 20-82. - Tree inspector approval required for certain trees. 
                  (a)	No person, firm, organization (including the authority), society, association or corporation, or any agent or representative thereof, shall directly or indirectly destroy or remove any four-inch dbh native shade tree or larger, or two-inch dbh live oak, without approval of the tree inspector, or any unless otherwise authorized under provisions of this article. 
                  (b)	All utility companies, electric suppliers and governmental agencies constructing or maintaining easements for television transmission or rights-of-way will not be exempt from the provisions of this article. 
                  (Ord. of 1-13-2010, § 4)
                  Sec. 20-83. - Tree trimming/pruning. 
                  (a)	No person, firm, organization, (including the authority), society, association or corporation, or agent or representative thereof, shall directly or indirectly prune or remove any branch larger than two inches in diameter on any shade tree without approval of the tree inspector. Prior to engaging in such pruning activity, approval must be granted by the tree inspector in the form of a tree permit. This can be obtained by contacting the tree inspector by telephone or in writing. Please allow ten working days for the inspector to issue a permit. Trimming native and exotic palm trees, foundation plantings and branches less than two inches in diameter will not require the approval or notification of the tree inspector and is exempt from the tree permit process. 
                  (b)	All pruning must be performed to the pruning specifications as provided by the National Arborist Association (NAA) in Pruning Standards for Shade Trees shall apply. 
                  (c)	All branches that are removed need to have their finished cuts made immediately beyond the bark ridges, preserving the branch collar. Stub cuts cannot be made more than one inch or more beyond the branch collar. Flush cuts must be made adjacent and not through the branch collar in order for the resulting tree wounds to heal properly. 
                  (d)	Significant pruning cuts that result in drastic reduction of a tree's canopy, negatively impact the tree's overall aesthetics or flush cuts that exceed one-third of the size of the diameter of the tree trunk or branch at the point in which the flush cut is made will require mitigation. For every caliper inch in width of the branch at the location of the final flush cut, each caliper inch will have to be mitigated at a 1:2 ratio. If several tree limbs are removed, each cut will be assessed as a separate mitigation requirement. However, in no circumstance will the mitigation requirement exceed more than one-half of the overall dbh of the tree. 
                  (e)	Creating stub cuts, random branch removal, and the topping of native shade trees are strictly prohibited. These practices defeat the primary aim of ensuring long-term tree health, create hazards, and drastically reduce the monetary value of trees. 
                  (f)	Pruning and removal of trees in utility easements or rights of way shall be the minimum necessary to protect the property of the applicable utility company. Pruning shall be performed to the pruning specifications as provided by the National Arborist Association (NAA) in Pruning Standards for Shade Trees. All branches removed must be flush cuts or pruned back to the branch collar of the adjoining main branch or trunk of the tree. Cutting into the branch collar will not be permitted as the collar helps the tree heal after pruning. The authority shall be informed by the applicable utility company of the time and approximate location of any tree pruning or removal activities in rights-of-way easements prior to conducting such activities.

                  Sec. 20-84. - New construction requirements. 
                  (a)	Application and scope. 
                  (1)	The destruction of any tree without a written permit is prohibited on any parcel of leased land. For new building construction, a tree survey must first be conducted to identify all healthy and structurally weak trees on the site in order to facilitate the overall design of the site. Having this information readily available in the initial design phase will allow the property owner to identify which trees are worth saving in order minimize mitigation requirements as well as minimize construction impacts to the trees that will remain. 
                  (2)	For a property owner wanting to make an addition to a structural unit, it must be a minimum of ten feet from the trunk of historic trees and all live oaks (Quercus virginiana) or follow the 3:1 rule as described within subsection (b)(3) of this section, encroachment. 
                  (3)	Encroachment of an addition shall not be permitted within the base of a protected, historic or specimen tree, unless special construction methods, including but not limited to beam foundations, are used and certified as acceptable by the authority's tree inspector. The owner will bear full responsibility to any future damage the tree may cause such as cracking or foundation upheaval if it occurs. 
                  (b)	During development. 
                  (1)	Protective barricades required. Protective barricades shall be placed around all protected trees and significant trees located in a development area prior to the commencement of any work, and shall remain in place until development activities are complete or construction in accordance with standards set forth in this section commences. The area within the protective barricade shall remain free of all building materials, dirt or other construction materials, debris, vehicles and development activities. Barricades shall be erected at a minimum distance from the base of protected trees and significant trees according to the following standards: 
                  a.	For protected trees eight inches dbh, protective barricades shall be placed a minimum distance of ten feet from the base of each protected tree or to drip line. 
                  b.	Protected trees greater than ten inches dbh, protective barricades shall be placed at a minimum distance of one foot for each inch of dbh or to drip line (see figure 1 in section 20-95). 
                  c.	Protective barricades will only be permitted to be placed closer to a tree upon approval by the tree inspector. 
                  (2)	Passive forms of tree protection may be utilized to delineate tree save areas, which are remote from areas of land disturbance. These areas must be completely surrounded with continuous rope or flagging. All passive tree protection must be accompanied by "Keep Out" or "Tree Protection Area" signage. The area so fenced off shall not be used as a storage area or altered or disturbed except as may be permitted in this subsection (b). 
                  (3)	Encroachment of construction within the protective barricade. The area so fenced off shall not be used as a storage area in connection with the development. Changes in grade or construction of impervious surfaces or utilities within the required protective barricade shall be permitted or prohibited subject to the following guidelines: 
                  a.	In all circumstances, the minimum distance from the tree radius which cannot be encroached upon by soil disruption, trenching and general excavation will follow the 3:1 rule. For every three inches of dbh, a minimum of one foot of distance from the tree radius cannot be encroached upon, as measured from the outermost perimeter edge of tree's trunk. (For example: a tree with a nine-inch-dbh must have a minimum distance of three feet from the tree radius, which cannot be encroached upon.) 
                  b.	Compaction of the soil within the protective barricade shall be avoided. No heavy equipment can be operated or parked within the protective barricade. 
                  c.	All brush, earth and other debris shall be removed in a manner, which prevents injury to the protected tree. Oil, gas, chemicals or other substances that may be harmful to trees shall not be stored or dumped within the protective barricade of any protected tree. 
                  d.	Construction of impervious surfaces shall not be permitted within the base of a protected, historic or specimen tree, unless special construction methods, including but not limited to tree feeders, porous paving materials and shell walks, are used and certified as acceptable by the authority's tree inspector. 
                  (4)	All roots outside of the protective barricade to be removed during the development shall be severed clean and a two-inch-layer of mulch shall be applied over the surface or exposed roots during development if feasible. 
                  (5)	Trenching. The installation of utilities through a protective zone should occur by way of tunneling rather then trenching. If roots must be cut, proper root-pruning procedures must be employed. Wherever feasible, trenching should occur in a radial direction to or from a tree in order to minimize damage to tree roots. In no circumstances will trenching be allowed within the critical root zone as defined by the 3:1 rule as explained in subsection (b)(3) of this section. Tunneling and selective excavation within this area is subject to approval by the tree inspector. 
                  (6)	Grade changes. Moderate fill, no greater than six inches can be tolerated within a trees critical root zone without the prior installation of an aeration system. Commercially available aeration systems are subject to approval by the tree inspector. 
                  (7)	Where the tree inspector has determined that irreparable damage has occurred to trees within tree protective zones, the trees must be removed and replaced. 
                  (8)	Remedial procedures. Remedial site reclamation and tree care procedures shall be implemented when encroachment within protective zones has caused damage to either the tree or the tree's growing site, and that damage is repairable. If encroachment is anticipated or has happened, these cultural practices should be employed as preemptive measures to improve survival. The following practices shall be applied where appropriate: 
                  a.	Pruning. The pruning of a tree in anticipation of construction damage may provide compensation for potential root loss and produce an invigorating response. A tree that has suffered root damage becomes stressed, as that root system no longer provides sufficient water and nutrients for the existing crown. This stress becomes evident with the appearance of "staghorns" or deadwood within the tree crown. Once a tree has been construction damaged, it is advisable to delay pruning until deadwood becomes evident (one to three years). Pruning for deadwood removal is then recommended. The removal of live plant tissue from a construction-damaged tree can accelerate the tree's decline. Pruning of root-severed trees may reduce the possibility of wind throw. Trees that have not been affected by construction activities can be pruned for maintenance of the tree's health, appearance, and safety, utilizing acceptable arboricultural practices. Pruning specifications as provided by the National Arborist Association (NAA) in Pruning Standards for Shade Trees shall apply. The pruning of all trees is subject to tree inspector approval. No tree limb greater than two inches in diameter shall be removed without written approval. Prior to engaging in such pruning activity, approval must be granted by the tree inspector in the form of a tree permit. This can be obtained by contacting the tree inspector by telephone or in writing. Please allow ten working days for the inspector to issue a permit. 
                  b.	Fertilizer applications will enhance the vigor of trees stressed by site disturbances, thereby promoting root development. Information regarding appropriate fertilizers and application rates may be obtained from the state agricultural extension office. 
                  c.	A tree's ability for adequate root development, and ultimately its chances for survival, is improved with reclamation of the growing site. 
                  d.	Wherever possible, the soil should be brought back to its natural grade. Unnecessary fill, compaction, erosion sedimentation, concrete washout, and construction debris should be removed. When machinery is required for site improvement, it is recommended that a "Bobcat" or similar lightweight rubber tire or rubber-tracked vehicle be used so as to minimize soil compaction. Compacted soil within the critical root zones of trees should be aerated. This is best accomplished with a two-inch diameter auger or a hydraulic air spade. If using an auger, holes should be drilled to a depth of six to 12 inches, approximately two to three feet apart and radiating outward from the tree's trunk in a bicycle spoke configuration. This aeration technique is also recommended for areas affected by minor fill or the sedimentation of erosion materials. The air exchange, nutrient and water holding capacities of soils can be improved with soil amendments. This is best accomplished by backfilling holes with mineral amendments such as perlite, vermiculite, isolite, etc. A two- to three-inch layer of mulch material, such as pine straw, pine bark or wood chips, spread within the critical root zones of trees on construction sites is extremely beneficial. These benefits include: 
                  1.	Conservation of soil moisture.
                  2.	Reduced rainfall runoff and erosion.
                  3.	Reduced soil compaction from construction activities.
                  4.	Reduced competition from grasses and weeds.
                  5.	Increased soil fertility.
                  6.	Improved soil structure.
                  7.	Moderation of soil temperature, with a subsequent increase in root development activity.
                  (Ord. of 1-13-2010, § 6)
                  Sec. 20-85. - Tree removal and replacement. 
                  (a)	Prior to removing any existing live oak greater than two inches at dbh or any shade tree eight inches at dbh or greater (both native and nonnative species), or performing any major pruning or the removal of branches two inches in diameter or greater on such trees, a tree permit must be obtained from the tree inspector. This can be obtained by contacting the tree inspector by telephone or in writing. Please allow ten working days for the inspector to issue a permit. 
                  (b)	Tree replacement required. Removal of each protected tree or significant tree or removal of branches two inches in diameter or greater without a written tree permit is a violation of this article and shall require replacement in caliper inches in equal dbh removed from the site. 
                  (c)	All other replacement shall be calculated as follows:
                  (1)	Live oak (Quercus virginiana). Any size: requires a 1:1 caliper-inch replacement ratio for healthy trees in good condition, exhibiting only minor structural defects. Live oaks in extreme poor health, exhibiting significant structural defects, or posing a clear safety issue to persons or property, will require a minimum 2½- to three-inch dbh replacement, regardless of the overall size of the existing tree. Live oak trees in poor-fair condition will require up to a ½:1 caliper-inch ratio depending upon the overall structural integrity of the tree. All replacement trees must be live oak (Quercus virginiana) and a minimum of 2½ to three inches in dbh. 
                  (2)	Slash pine (Pinus elliottii) 23-inch dbh or smaller. No replacement required unless the overall density of trees on the lot is less than the minimum density factor for the site. In such circumstances where the total caliper inches is less than the minimum required density, every tree that is removed must be replaced with a 2½- to three-inch dbh native shade tree or slash pine. 
                  (3)	Slash pine (Pinus elliottii) 24-inch dbh or larger. Replacements are required. All trees to be removed are to be replaced with any native shade tree 2½- to three-inch dbh or larger. 
                  (4)	Bald cypress (Taxodium distichum). 24-inch dbh or larger: replacements are required. All trees to be removed are to be replaced with any native shade tree 2½- to three-inch dbh or larger. 
                  (5)	Dahoon holly (Ilex cassine). Eight inches of dbh or larger: replacements are required. All trees to be removed are to be replaced with any native shade tree 2½- to three-inch dbh or larger or a multitrunk native tree that is a minimum size of ten to 12 feet. 
                  (6)	Red bay (Persea borbonica). Eight inches of dbh or larger: no replacements are required unless the overall density of trees on the lot is less than the minimum density factor for the site. Due to recent ambroisia red bay beetle attacks, replacing trees with another red bay is not suggested. In such instances where the total caliper inches is less than the minimum required density, all trees removed are to be replaced with any native shade tree 2½- to three-inch dbh or larger or a multitrunk native tree that is a minimum size of ten to 12 feet. 
                  (7)	American holly (Ilex opaca). Eight inches of dbh or larger: replacements are required. All trees to be removed are to be replaced with any native shade tree 2½- to three-inch dbh or larger or a multitrunk native tree that is a minimum size of ten to 12 feet. 
                  (8)	Buckthorn (Sideroxylon tenax). Eight inches of dbh or larger: replacements are required. All trees to be removed are to be replaced with any native shade tree 2½- to three-inch dbh or larger or a multitrunk native tree that is a minimum size of ten to 12 feet. 
                  (9)	Cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto). Any size, no replacements are required unless the overall density of trees on the lot is less than the minimum density factor for the site or if the palm is historic. Historic cabbage palms planted within the historic district must be replaced on a palm for palm ratio. Cabbage palms are monocots and create only a fraction of the overall canopy of a mature shade tree. Cabbage palms can be used as a mitigation tree, but each cabbage palm planted will only count as one inch of dbh towards mitigation. 
                  (10)	Nonhistoric trees. Miscellaneous oaks, exotic palms, invasive exotics, nonnative species, cedars and hardwoods 23 inches dbh or less: no replacements required unless the overall density of trees on the lot is less than the minimum density factor for the site. In such instances where the total caliper inches is less than the minimum required density, every tree that is removed must be replaced with any native shade tree 2½- to three-inch dbh or larger or a multitrunk native tree that is a minimum size of ten to 12 feet. 
                  (11)	Historic trees. Miscellaneous oaks, cedars and hardwoods 24 inches dbh or larger: replacements are required. All trees to be removed are to be replaced with any native shade tree 2½- to three-inch dbh or larger or a multitrunk native tree that is a minimum size of ten to 12 feet. 
                  (12)	Specimen trees. Typically 24-inch dbh or larger, but it can be smaller depending upon the specific plant species. A tree will only be designated as a specimen upon approval by the tree inspector, a certified arborist, or authorized agents. The tree must be of notable historical value or interest because of its age, size, historic association or unique aesthetic value. The tree must be in good or fair condition (see section 20-95) in order to merit this designation. The leased property owner must attempt all reasonable efforts to design around the tree in its existing location prior to being given permission for its removal. All specimen trees permitted to be removed will require a 3:1 caliper-inch replacement. 
                  (d)	During the planting process, the planting hole should be a minimum of twice the size of the tree's root ball and soil amenities added to the backfill material (see figure 2 in section 20-95). Also, every effort should be made to water the newly planted tree for the first growing year. 
                  (e)	Replacement for commercial and residential sites. Replacement tree sizes shall be measured in caliper inches according to the American Nursery Stock Standards (ANSS) and total number of inches removed from site is measured at dbh (4½ feet) above the ground. All replacement trees must be grade A quality with a dominant leader and dense foliage and free from injury, pest, disease or nutritional disorders. All replacement trees must survive for at least five years; otherwise, the replacement trees must be replaced at the owner's expense. 
                  (1)	Any healthy historic live oaks, which are to be removed, the replacements will be 100 percent of dbh inches removed. This is a 1:1 relationship. 
                  (2)	Trees identified as a specimen tree, which are to be removed, the replacement will be at a 3:1 caliper-inch ratio. 
                  (3)	Any nonhistoric live oak trees which are to be removed, regardless of size, the replacements will be a minimum of 2½ to three inches at dbh on a 1:1 relationship. 
                  (4)	Replanting schedule standards. To prevent a monoculture among plantings, the authority shall require diversity in the plantings required (see section 20-92). 
                  (5)	Approved list of native shade trees and prohibited invasive exotic tree species (see section 20-93). 
                  (Ord. of 1-13-2010, § 7)
                  Sec. 20-86. - Relocation of mature trees. 
                  The relocation of a mature tree is a labor and cost-intensive undertaking that may fail even under the best of conditions. However, mature trees may be relocated, providing the relocation meets all of the following criteria: 
                  (1)	The leased property owner has made all reasonable efforts to design around the tree in the existing location. 
                  (2)	The tree is in good condition for relocation, to be determined by a licensed arborist or the tree inspector. 
                  (3)	There must be another suitable location for the tree on the leased property or other approved island location. 
                  (4)	The future location must not require excessive removal of additional existing trees in good condition and/or healthy understory vegetation. 
                  (5)	Trees shall only be dug and moved during the planting season, October 1 through June 1. 
                  (6)	The leaseholder must employ a tree moving company that is approved by the tree inspector.
                  (7)	The applicant must submit a detailed tree care plan including both pre-move and post-move care specifications to be approved by the tree inspector. 
                  (8)	The leaseholder is aware, that should the relocated tree die, mitigation planting will be required per section 20-85, tree removal and replacement. 
                  (Ord. of 1-13-2010, § 8)
                  Sec. 20-87. - Minimum required tree density. 
                  (a)	Mitigation required. For all residential and commercial properties, mitigation will be required unless a minimum tree density of 100 caliper inches measured at dbh is maintained per acre of the leased property. No trees will be permitted to be removed unless the total amount of dbh caliper inches are mitigated to the leased property's existing tree density at a 1:1 caliper-inch ratio. Mitigation will be required even if the tree is diseased, structurally compromised or dies of natural causes. For most residential lots, this will equate to approximately 36 dbh caliper inches per leased property lot. Only native shade trees will be counted in order to determine the existing tree density on a leased property. Cabbage palms will only have a density value of one-inch dbh per tree. (For example: A leased property owner requests to remove an 18-inch dbh slash pine tree on a 0.38 acre parcel that has an existing tree density of 50 dbh caliper inches. The minimum required dbh caliper inches for this leased property is (0.38 acres times 100 inches equals 38 dbh caliper inches). Removing the 18-inch dbh slash pine will result in an overall density of 34 dbh caliper inches. Therefore, a minimum of six dbh caliper inches must be mitigated for this site. 
                  (b)	Mitigation not required. For all residential and commercial properties, mitigation will not be required if a minimum tree density of 200 caliper inches measured at dbh is maintained per acre of the leased property unless the tree is a live oak, historic or protected tree. For most residential lots, this will equate to approximately 75 dbh caliper inches per leased property lot. Only native shade trees will be counted in order to determine the existing tree density on a leased property. Cabbage palms will only have a density value of one-inch dbh per tree. 
                  (c)	Mandatory mitigation if removal does not meet minimum density. Tree replacement/mitigation will be mandatory for properties if the removal of any tree results in a property that does not meet this minimum tree density range. If the overall amount of dbh caliper inches that are removed results in a property with less than 200 caliper inches but greater than 100 caliper inches, the total number of caliper inches removed will not be required to be mitigated to meet the minimum tree density required of the leased property unless a healthy live oak in good condition is removed. Trees will be mitigated at a tree-tree ratio as opposed to 1-1 caliper inch ratio. For all other native tree species, including poor condition live oaks, each tree that is removed must be replaced with a minimum 2½- to three-inch dbh native shade tree or a multitrunk native tree that is a minimum size of ten to 12 feet depending upon the tree species that is removed. Mitigation will be required even if the tree is diseased, structurally compromised or dies of natural causes. All tree replacement requirements shall comply with section 20-85, tree removal location and replacements. (For example: A leased property owner requests to remove an 22 dbh slash pine tree on a 0.38 acre parcel that has an existing tree density of 90 dbh caliper inches. The minimum required dbh caliper inches for this leased property is (0.38 acres times 200 inches equals 76 dbh caliper inches.) Removing the 18-inch dbh slash pine will result in an overall density of 68 dbh caliper inches. Therefore, a minimum of one 2½- to three-inch dbh per caliper-inch of tree must be mitigated for this site as opposed to mitigating the balance of six caliper inches as the overall density is still above the full mitigation minimum tree density of 100 caliper inches per acre or 38 dbh caliper inches for this leased property.

                  Sec. 20-88. - Submission of site plans. 
                  (a)	Where application for a building permit is submitted to the county, a site plan for the development or improvement of any parcel of land shall be submitted to the island authority. The site plans shall show the following information: 
                  (1)	The building site;
                  (2)	The buildable area;
                  (3)	The yard areas;
                  (4)	Proposed landscaping improvements;
                  (5)	A registered survey of all existing trees with a dbh greater than eight inches, including live oaks (Quercus virginiana) with a dbh of two inches or greater; 
                  (6)	Designation of any historic trees (refer to section 20-78 for the definition of an historic tree) will be designated by the authority's tree inspector or a certified arborist; 
                  (7)	Trees to be maintained within the buildable area and yard area with location for each to be shown with reasonable accuracy, the plan must show either existing contours or an existing spot elevation at the outer edge of the root flair and proposed grading if any is going to occur as a spot elevation or proposed contours; 
                  (8)	Specifications for protection of trees to be maintained during development;
                  (9)	A tree replacement schedule showing the location, species and size of any replacement trees to be planted; 
                  (10)	Specifications and/or provisions for maintenance and upkeep of trees upon completion of the project. 
                  (b)	No building permit shall be issued until the site plan has been reviewed and approved by the tree inspector. The inspector shall tentatively approve, approve conditionally or disapprove the plan. If the plan is disapproved or approved conditionally, the reasons for such action shall be stated in writing and signed by the executive director of the authority. One copy of the reasons shall be retained by the authority, and one copy given to the applicant. On conditional approval, the tree inspector may require the applicant to resubmit the plan with all recommended changes before granting final approval. 
                  (Ord. of 1-13-2010, § 10)
                  Sec. 20-89. - Exceptions. 
                  (a)	In the event that any tree shall be determined to be diseased, in a hazardous or dangerous condition so as to endanger the public health, safety, or welfare, and requires immediate removal without delay, written authorization shall be given by the tree inspector or his designee and the tree removed. If the tree inspector cannot be reached immediately, digital photos must be taken of the hazardous tree prior to its removal. The digital photos can be submitted to the tree inspector or emailed to the authority. If the hazardous tree is a live oak, replacement with another 2½- to three-inch dbh live oak, on any agreed upon location of the leased parcel, will still be required. Historic trees and protected trees will also require mitigation as defined in section 20-85, tree removal and replacement. 
                  (b)	During the period of an emergency, such as a tornado, hurricane, flood or any act of nature, the requirements of this article may be waived by the executive director or assignee. In such case, the cutting and removal of felled trees shall be permitted until such time the authority deemed it necessary. 
                  (Ord. of 1-13-2010, § 11)
                  Sec. 20-90. - Mitigation. 
                  It is the policy of the authority that leaseholders who are granted a permit to remove an historic or specimen tree make every effort to mitigate for the loss of the tree by replanting replacement trees on their leased property. If the property will not reasonably sustain the number of replacement trees to satisfy the entire mitigation requirement through in-kind mitigation, a mitigation fee may be the only feasible option. 
                  (1)	Mitigation fee. The mitigation fee to be paid shall be determined by the following formula: $200.00 multiplied times dbh (diameter at breast height of tree to be removed). The mitigation fee will be available to any property owner that is unable to provide in-kind mitigation on their leased property. Specimen tree mitigation fees will be $200.00 multiplied times dbh times three. 
                  (2)	Funds from collected mitigation fees shall be expended only for the following purposes:
                  a.	In support of planting live oaks or other native shade trees on public property within the state park. Such expenditures may include the cost of purchasing and planting trees, planting amendments, and the cost of installing irrigation improvements. 
                  b.	In support of the care, maintenance and preservation of existing native trees on public property. This would include the cost of fertilization, aeration of tree roots, and general tree structure maintenance such as dead wooding and pruning broken and structurally weak branches. 
                  (3)	The authority shall prepare an annual report accounting for the balance in the tree maintenance fund and summarizing the use to which such funding was put during the preceding year. 
                  (4)	The authority may also accept donations, grants or other sources for specific tree related activities such as a tree naming program. 
                  (5)	In-kind mitigation. The property owner may elect to satisfy some or all of the mitigation requirements by planting new trees on his property. If in-kind mitigation is elected, the property owner must plant 2½- to three-inch dbh or larger replacement trees until the required mitigation number is reached or a reasonable number of replacement trees have been reached. Each replacement tree that is planted as in-kind mitigation will be deducted from the total mitigation fee at $200.00 per caliper inch. Where a property owner elects to satisfy some or all of the mitigation requirement through in-kind mitigation, the property owner shall do so with the understanding that the property owner will be responsible for protecting the health of the replacement trees (including the obligation to provide irrigation), that purposeful damaging or neglect of the replacement trees will be subject to fines and additional mitigation requirements. 
                  (Ord. of 1-13-2010, § 12)
                  Sec. 20-91. - Appeals. 
                  (a)	The island tree board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the tree inspector in the enforcement of this article, provided that such appeals must be submitted in writing on forms provided by the authority to the tree board within 30 days after the order, requirement, decision, or determination which is alleged to be made in error. The island tree board shall act upon the application as expeditiously as possible and shall notify the applicant within five days of the action taken. 
                  (b)	The island tree board shall be comprised of:
                  (1)	At least one island authority staff member;
                  (2)	An acting member of the Jekyll Island Garden Club;
                  (3)	An acting member of the Jekyll Island Citizens' Association; and
                  (4)	The county extension agent.
                  (c)	Appeals shall only be granted for errors of interpretation or where the unique natural features of the site are such that application of these regulations would create an undue hardship to the leaseholder.

                  (1)	An estimated life expectancy of greater than ten years.
                  (2)	A relatively sound and solid trunk with only minor decay and small cavities that comprise an area of depth of less than 33 percent of the adjacent diameter of the tree. 
                  (3)	No more than 25 percent of the base of the trunk or primary structural roots should exhibit dieback. 
                  (4)	No major insect or pathological problem.
                  (5)	No more than 33 percent of the tree's canopy can be missing limbs or be comprised of major dead limbs.

                  (a)	The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Motor vehicle means every vehicle which is self-propelled as defined by O.C.G.A. § 40-1-1(29), including but not limited to mopeds, as defined by O.C.G.A. § 40-1-1(20), golf carts and all-terrain vehicles. 
                  (b)	All motor vehicles shall be restricted to streets and parking areas only and shall be prohibited from all other areas including, but not limited to, the beaches, dune areas and the approaches thereto, the bicycle paths, the golf cart paths and the nature walking trails.

                  Sec. 24-3. - Overnight parking.

                  Sec. 24-4. - Golf carts. 
                  (a)	Purpose and definitions. 
                  (1)	Purpose. There is a public interest in having a means of travel that is cost effective, energy efficient and an alternate means of travel for short distances on the Island instead of using motor vehicles. This article establishes the minimum standards for the operator to use when traveling upon public streets, roads and highways and property owned or leased by the authority. 
                  (2)	Definitions. For the purposes of this section, a "golf cart" is defined as a "motorized cart" having no less than three wheels and an unladen weight of 1,300 pounds or less and which cannot operate at more than 20 miles per hour. The definition is repeated here for convenience only and the definition set out in O.C.G.A. § 40-1-1, as amended from time to time, is controlling for this purpose. 
                  (b)	Legality. The operation of golf carts on the public streets, roads and highways within the geographic boundaries of Jekyll Island and on property owned or leased by the authority in compliance with the rules and regulations of this section shall be permitted. 
                  (c)	Rules and regulations. The following rules and regulations are adopted for the operation of golf carts. Low speed vehicles shall be operated under the Georgia regulations for licensed motor vehicles.

                  b.	Front and rear turn signal lights;
                  c.	Tail lights;
                  d.	Brake lights;
                  e.	An interior rear view mirror;
                  f.	Parking brake;
                  g.	Windshield;
                  h.	A Type 1 or Type 2 seat belt assembly installed at each seating position.
                  (3)	Golf carts are permitted to be operated only on streets with a posted speed limit of 35 mph or less; 
                  (4)	Golf cart operators must adhere to all traffic regulations and requirements applicable to the road or street being traveled and must yield the right-of-way to approaching vehicles; 
                  (5)	Golf carts are not permitted to travel on sidewalks, bike paths or any motorized vehicle restricted areas; 
                  (6)	All occupants shall be in a seated position on an installed seat and the use of seat belts shall be mandatory while the cart is in motion; 
                  (7)	All persons operating golf carts must be observant of, and attentive to the safety of themselves and others, including their passengers, other motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians. The Georgia State Patrol and the Jekyll Island Code Enforcement has the authority to issue a citation to the operator for violations of the terms of this section; 
                  (8)	Golf carts shall be parked in the same manner and place as designated parking for other motor vehicles. Stopping, standing or parking carts in places and in a manner not allowed for vehicle parking or so as to impede the flow of traffic, pedestrian walkways or passageways are prohibited. Parking in reserved handicapped locations requires the appropriate handicap placard or sticker; 
                  (9)	Golf carts shall not be used for commercial purposes such as, but not limited to, taxicabs, buses, or hauling freight; 
                  (10)	Golf carts shall not be used for the towing of another cart, wagon, skateboard, or a person on roller skates, bicycle and the like; 
                  (11)	No open containers of alcoholic beverages are permitted on a golf cart while on a public street, road or highway or on property owned or leased by the authority. 
                  (d)	Allowable uses. Golf carts operated under the following uses are not required to meet the provisions of paragraph (c) above:

                  (2)	The use of golf carts in connection with a parade, a festival or other special event, provided the consent of the sponsor is obtained and such vehicle is used only in conjunction with such event. 
                  (e)	Penalties. Operation of a golf cart in violation of the provisions of this section will subject the offender to a civil penalty not exceeding $100.00 for each offense, which shall be paid to the Clerk of the Magistrate Court of Glynn County within the time proscribed on the notice of the violation. 
                  (f)	Liability disclaimer. This section is adopted to address the interest of public safety. Golf carts are not designed or manufactured to be used on public streets and the Jekyll Island Authority in no way advocates or endorse their operation on public streets or roads. The Jekyll Island Authority, by regulating such operation is merely trying to address obvious safety issues, and adoption of this section is not to be relied upon as a determination that operating on pubic streets is safe or advisable if done in accordance with this section. All persons who operate or ride upon golf carts on public streets or roads do so at their own risk and peril, and must be observant of, and attentive to the safety of themselves and others, including their passengers, other motorists, bicycles, and pedestrians. The Jekyll Island Authority has no liability under any theory of liability and the authority assumes no liability for permitting golf carts to be operated on public streets and roads under the laws passed by the Georgia Legislature.
