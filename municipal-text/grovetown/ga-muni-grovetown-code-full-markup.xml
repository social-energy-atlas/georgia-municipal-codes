        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                  This Code constitutes a complete republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of
                  Grovetown, Georgia.
                  Source materials used in the preparation of this republication were the 1990 Code, as supplemented through
                  November 25, 2002, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council.
                  5/10/2019 Grovetown, GA Code of Ordinances
                  3/414
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within
                  each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and
                  which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their
                  location within the Code is included at the back of this Code.
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local
                  government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash
                  refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter.
                  Thus, the second section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of Chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this
                  system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their
                  proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one
                  section that would logically come between Sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would
                  be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles,
                  may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the
                  end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or
                  division. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new
                  chapters.
                  Page Numbering System
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an
                  abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents
                  the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon
                  indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of
                  the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may
                  or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:
                  CHARTER CHT:1
                  CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1
                  CODE CD1:1
                  CODE COMPARATIVE TABLE CCT:1
                  STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1
                  CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1
                  CODE INDEX CDi:1
                  Indexes
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several
                  headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language
                  generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the
                  indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is
                  interested.
                  Looseleaf Supplements
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the
                  publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be
                  properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders
                  5/10/2019 Grovetown, GA Code of Ordinances
                  4/414
                  of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete
                  pages.
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised
                  pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted
                  according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be
                  inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and
                  filed for historical reference purposes.
                  Acknowledgments
                  This republication was under the direct supervision of Bonnie Mitchell, Editor, of the Municipal Code
                  Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their
                  sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.
                  The publisher is most grateful to Vicky Capetillo, City Clerk, and other officers of the city for their cooperation
                  and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the
                  publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to
                  all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE
                  The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been
                  considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are
                  codified in the Code Book and are considered "Includes." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent
                  nature are not codified in the Code Book and are considered "Omits."

               CHARTER
                  FOOTNOTE(S):
                  (1) Editor's noteâ The charter, consisting of Ga. Laws 1998, Act No. 787, p. 4198, and amendments, is set out
                  herein as enacted, except as noted, and except that material enclosed in brackets has been inserted by the editor
                  for explanation or to update state law references. Amendatory acts and ordinances are cited in parentheses
                  following amended sections or subsections. Also cross references and state law references have been inserted in
                  footnotes.
                  Act. No. 787, adopted April 2, 1998, repealed the city charter in its entirety and enacted a new charter. The
                  previous charter derived from Ga. Laws 1959, Act No. 111, p. 2223; Ga. Laws 1970, Act. No. 825, p. 2226, Â§ 2;
                  Ord. No. 73, adopted Oct. 17, 1973.
                  ARTICLE I. - INCORPORATION AND POWERS
                  5/10/2019 Grovetown, GA Code of Ordinances
                  6/414
                  Sec. 1.10. - Name.
                  This city and the inhabitants thereof are constituted and declared a body politic and corporate under the name
                  and style Grovetown, Georgia, and by that name shall have perpetual succession.
                  Sec. 1.11. - Corporate boundaries.
                  (a)
                  The boundaries of this city shall be those existing on the earliest effective date in 1998 of the adoption of this
                  charter with such alterations as may be made from time to time in the manner provided by law. The boundaries
                  of this city at all times shall be shown on a map, a written description, or any combination thereof, to be retained
                  permanently in the office of the city clerk and to be designated, as the case may be: "Official Map (or
                  Description) of the corporate limits of the City of Grovetown, Georgia." Photographic, typed, or other copies of
                  such map or description certified by the city clerk shall be admitted as evidence in all courts and shall have the
                  same force and effect as with the original map or description.
                  (b)
                  The city council may provide for the redrawing of any such map by ordinance to reflect lawful changes in the
                  corporate boundaries. A redrawn map shall supersede for all purposes the entire map or maps which it is
                  designated to replace.
                  Sec. 1.12. - Powers and construction.
                  (a)
                  This city shall have all powers possible for a city to have under the present or future Constitution and laws of this
                  state as fully and completely as though they were specifically enumerated in this charter. This city shall have all
                  the powers of self-government not otherwise prohibited by this charter or by general law.
                  (b)
                  The powers of this city shall be construed liberally in favor of the city. The specific mention or failure to mention
                  particular powers shall not be construed as limiting in any way the powers of this city. These powers shall
                  include, but not be limited to, the following:

                  amended and adopted must provide for all expenditures required by state law or by other provisions of this
                  charter and for all debt service requirements for the ensuing fiscal year. The total appropriations from any fund
                  shall not exceed the estimated fund balance, reserves, and revenues.

                  for the ensuing fiscal year. Adoption of the budget shall take the form of an appropriations ordinance setting out
                  the estimated revenues in detail by sources and making appropriations according to fund and by organizational
                  unit, purpose, or activity as set out in the budget preparation ordinance adopted pursuant to Section 6.24 of this
                  charter.
                  (c)
                  The amount set out in the adopted operating budget for each organizational unit shall constitute the annual
                  appropriation for such, and no expenditure shall be made or encumbrance created in excess of the otherwise
                  unencumbered balance of the appropriations or allotment thereof to which it is chargeable.
                  Sec. 6.27. - Levy of taxes.

                  with other anticipated revenues, fund balances, and applicable reserves, to equal the total amount appropriated
                  for each of the several funds set forth in the annual operating budget for defraying the expenses of the general
                  government of this city.

                  at any regular meeting or special or emergency meeting called for such purpose, but any additional
                  appropriations may be made only from an existing unexpended surplus.

                  capital budget containing the means of financing the improvements proposed for the ensuing fiscal year. The city
                  council shall have power to accept, with or without amendments, or reject the proposed plan and budget. The
                  city council shall not authorize an expenditure for the construction of any building, structure, work, or
                  improvement unless the appropriations for such project are included in the capital improvements budget, except
                  to meet a public emergency as provided in Section 2.24 of this charter.
                  (b)
                  The city council shall adopt by ordinance the final capital improvements budget of each year. No appropriation
                  provided for in a prior capital improvements budget shall lapse until the purpose for which the appropriation was
                  made shall have been accomplished or abandoned; provided, however, the mayor may submit amendments to the
                  capital improvements budget at any time during the fiscal year, accompanied by the mayor's recommendations.

                  public accountant selected by the city council. The audit shall be conducted according to generally accepted
                  auditing principles. Any audit of any funds by the state or federal governments may be accepted as satisfying the
                  requirements of this charter. Copies of annual audit reports shall be available at printing costs to the public.
                  Sec. 6.31. - Procurement and property management.

                  (b)
                  The city council may quitclaim any rights it may have in property not needed for public purposes upon report by
                  the mayor and adoption of a resolution, both finding that the property is not needed for public or other purposes
                  and that the interest of the city has no readily ascertainable monetary value.
                  (c)
                  Whenever in opening, extending, or widening any street, avenue, alley, or public place of the city a small parcel
                  or tract of land is cut off or separated by such work from a larger tract or boundary of land owned by the city, the
                  city council may authorize the mayor to sell and convey said cut-off or separated parcel or tract of land to an
                  abutting or adjoining property owner or owners where such sale and conveyance facilitates the highest and best
                  use of the abutting owner's property. Included in the sales contract shall be a provision for the rights of way of
                  said street, avenue, alley, or public place. Each abutting property owner shall be notified of the availability of the
                  property and given the opportunity to purchase said property under such terms and conditions as set out by
                  ordinance. All deeds and conveyances heretofore and hereafter so executed and delivered shall convey all title
                  and interest the city has in such property, notwithstanding the fact that no public sale after advertisement was or
                  is hereafter made.

                  ordinances passed by the council or adopted by initiative and referendum during the period covered by the
                  supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they
                  will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially
                  obsolete. The new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current
                  through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. Charter amendments may be
                  included in like manner.

                  excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages.
                  (c)
                  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized
                  to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances
                  included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified Code. For example,
                  the codifier may:
                  (1)
                  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions;
                  (2)
                  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the
                  supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles;
                  (3)
                  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to
                  accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers;
                  (4)
                  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division,"
                  etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ;#rule; through ;#rule;" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections
                  of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and
                  (5)
                  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted
                  into the Code; but, in no case, shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material
                  included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.
                  Sec. 1-8. - General penalty; continuing violations; abatement of nuisances.
                  (a)
                  Whenever in this Code or in any ordinance or resolution of the city amending this Code, any act is prohibited or
                  is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever in such Code, ordinance or
                  resolution the doing of any act is required or the failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no
                  specific penalty is provided therefore, the violation of any such provision of this Code or any ordinance or
                  resolution shall be punished by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), or by imprisonment for a
                  period not to exceed six (6) months or both, or by fine, imprisonment or alternative sentencing as provided by
                  law. Each day any violation of any provision of this Code or of any ordinance or resolution shall continue shall
                  constitute a separate offense.
                  (b)
                  In addition to the penalties provided in this section, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any
                  of the provisions of this Code or any ordinance shall be deemed a public nuisance and may be abated by the city,
                  as provided by law, and each day that such condition continues shall be regarded as a new and separate offense.

                  Sec. 2-51. - Intent.
                  It is essential to the proper administration and operation of the city that the members of its governing authority
                  be, and give the appearance of being, independent and impartial; that public office not be used for private gain;
                  and that there be public confidence in the integrity of the governing authority. The governing authority finds that
                  the public interest requires that they protect against such conflicts of interest by establishing appropriate ethical
                  standards with respect to the conduct of the members of the governing authority in situations where a conflict
                  may exist.

                  42/414
                  The city administrator shall maintain a listing of these ten (10) qualified citizens. Should the investigating
                  committee determine a complaint warrants a hearing before the board of ethics, the mayor and council, at the

                  until the specified five (5) members of the board of ethics have been appointed. Such board will elect one (1) of
                  its members to serve as chairman.
                  (4)
                  The members of the board of ethics shall serve without compensation. The governing authority of the city shall

                  To hold a hearing within sixty (60) days after the receipt of complaint. Failure to hold a hearing within the
                  specified time shall result in dismissal of the complaint as to the transaction and shall prevent refiling if a
                  complaint arises in the same incident for at least a period of six (6) months;
                  (3)
                  To prescribe forms, approved by the city attorney, for the disclosure required in this article and to make available
                  to the public information disclosed as provided in this section;
                  (4)
                  To receive and hear complaints of violations of the standards required by this article;

                  shall be denied a license for the same type and scope of operations as were being carried on at such date due to
                  the fact that such business does not qualify as an eating establishment, hotel, indoor commercial recreational
                  establishment or private club.

                  the licensee, regardless of the number of licenses or locations involved and regardless of whether or not the
                  licensee knew of or contributed to such violation. It is the intent of this subsection, without limiting its

                  51/414
                  (a)
                  Each license under this article shall be limited to the operation of an establishment or enterprise for the sale of
                  alcoholic beverages at a specific location as set forth in the license. Separate applications must be made and
                  separate licenses must be obtained for each location at which an activity requiring a license is conducted.
                  Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit a retail consumption dealer or retail package dealer from catering or
                  supplying a private party or gathering being put on by a third party at a location other than that covered by the
                  license.
                  (b)
                  For a retail consumption dealer, if the sale of alcoholic beverages within an establishment or business at a
                  specific location is handled through a concession contract, the license for such location shall be obtained jointly
                  in the name of the entity which operates the business or establishment within which such concession is located
                  and the name of the entity operating the concession. A "concession contract," for purposes of this subsection,
                  shall mean an agreement or arrangement where the person selling alcoholic beverages is doing so as a
                  department or section of a larger business enterprise, for example, a beverage service operated within a hotel,
                  food and beverage services operated within an indoor commercial recreational establishment or outdoor
                  commercial recreational establishment, or a beverage service operated within an eating establishment. For
                  purposes of determining whether a particular business enterprise qualifies as an eating establishment, hotel,
                  indoor commercial recreational establishment or an outdoor commercial recreational establishment, the
                  activities, facilities and sales of the business enterprise as a whole shall be aggregated, and the individual sales or
                  facilities of any concession therein shall not be treated separately.

                  (d)
                  Each application for an initial license as opposed to a license renewal shall have attached thereto a plat of the
                  land on which the establishment is proposed to be located showing the location of the improvements thereon.
                  Such plat must be prepared by a land surveyor registered under the laws of the state and the surveyor shall show

                  administer oaths.
                  (f)
                  An application shall be presented to the city council or a committee designated by the city council within fortyfive (45) days after the date such application is deemed complete by the city clerk. The city clerk shall notify the
                  applicant in writing of the date on which the application will be presented to the city council or its designated

                  and present any matters in support of the application and any other person may appear and present matters in

                  days in order to obtain further information. If the application is denied, the city council or its designated
                  committee shall set forth, in reasonable detail, the reasons for the denial.

                  If none of the applicants required in this subsection is a natural person, then the natural person having primary

                  in the assets or revenues of the limited partnership. At least one (1) of the applicants must be a natural person. If
                  none of the applicants required in this subsection is a natural person, then the natural person having primary
                  responsibility for the operation of the business for which the license is sought shall join in the application.
                  (d)

                  must be issued jointly to the entity and all of the other persons required by this section to join in the application.

                  No person shall be granted a license unless it shall appear to the satisfaction of the city council or its designated
                  committee that such person shall be of good moral character or, in the case of an entity which is not a natural
                  person, that such entity has a good reputation, and in no event shall a license be granted to any person who has
                  been convicted or has pled guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any charge involving a crime of moral
                  turpitude, gambling or illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or illegal possession of alcoholic
                  beverages within a period of ten (10) years immediately prior to the filing of such application. In the case of a
                  partnership, corporation, private club or other business entity, a license shall not be issued to the partnership,
                  corporation, private club or other entity if any partner, officer, director, shareholder or other person required to be
                  listed on the application, even if such person is not required to be a joint applicant, cannot meet the requirements
                  as set forth in this subsection in the same manner as though such individual was the applicant. At the time an
                  application is submitted for a license, the applicant shall, by a duly sworn affidavit, certify that all of the
                  requirements of this section have been met by the applicant and the other persons required to be listed on the
                  application as set forth in this subsection. Should any person in whose name a license is issued or any person
                  whose name is required to be listed on the application for a license under this article, after the license has been
                  issued, be convicted or plead guilty or nolo contendere to a charge involving a crime of moral turpitude,
                  gambling or illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or illegal possession of alcoholic beverages, the
                  license shall be immediately revoked and cancelled.
                  (i)
                  No license under this article shall be issued to any person convicted or pleading guilty or nolo contendere to any
                  charge under any federal, state or local law constituting a felony within ten (10) years prior to the date of the
                  filing of the application for such license.
                  (j)
                  No license under this article shall be issued to any person who has had any license issued under the police
                  powers of any city or county revoked within two (2) years prior to the filing of the application for a license under
                  this article.
                  (k)
                  The city council or its designated committee may decline to issue a license under this article when any person
                  having any ownership interest in or control over the land or building in which the establishment to be operated
                  pursuant to the license will be located does not meet the same character requirements as set forth in this section
                  for the licensee.
                  (l)
                  If a person in whose name a license under this article is issued is not a county resident, such person must appoint
                  and continuously maintain in the county a registered agent upon whom any process, notice or demand required
                  or permitted by law or under this article may be served. The registered agent must be a resident of the county. If
                  the licensee is not a natural person, it will be required to appoint and maintain a registered agent in the county if
                  it does not have in the county any agent upon whom process can legally be served for such entity under the laws
                  of the state. The licensee shall file the name of such registered agent, along with the written consent to serve of
                  such agent, with the city clerk.
                  (m)
                  An application for a license under this article may be denied where it appears to the city council or its designated
                  committee that the applicant does not have adequate financial strength, adequate financial participation in the

                  The city council or its designated committee, in its discretion, may consider any extenuating circumstances
                  which may reflect favorably or unfavorably on the applicant, the application or the proposed location of the
                  establishment. If, in the city council's or the committee's judgment, circumstances are such that issuing of a
                  license under this article would not be in the best interest of the general public, such circumstances may be
                  grounds for denying the application.

                  than one hundred (100) yards to a church building, library, daycare, children's nursery, or an alcoholic treatment
                  facility, or closer than two hundred (200) yards to a school building. In applying this section, the city council

                  acquired or established after December 31, 2002, or in the case of areas added to the designated areas which are
                  built, acquired or established after the effective date of such designation, distance shall be measured from the
                  main entrance door of the establishment for which a license is being sought to the nearest point of the centerline
                  of the nearest traveled road, street or highway, then measured along such centerline to a point on the centerline

                  measured in a straight line from such centerline to such main entrance door. If any church building, school
                  building, or alcoholic treatment facility located in one (1) of the designated areas on December 31, 2002 or the
                  effective date of designation of an area added to the designated areas after December 31, 2002, as the case may
                  be, thereafter has added to its campus additional land, measurement of the distance requirements shall continue
                  to be made as provided in the first sentence of this subsection (b), but the land acquired after December 31, 2002,
                  or the effective designation date, as the case may be, shall not be considered to be part of the land or campus of
                  the church building, school building, or alcoholic treatment facility.

                  No establishment which is being operated pursuant to a city license to sell beer and/or wine on January 1, 2003,
                  the effective date of this article, shall be denied continued operation under such existing license, nor denied any
                  renewal of such license, nor shall any new owner of such establishment be denied a new license based upon the
                  measurements set forth in this section. Upon cessation of the operation of the establishment as set forth in section
                  3-156 pursuant to such license, such exemption shall cease.
                  (d)
                  If the distance requirements in this section are met at the time of issuance of a license under this article, the
                  subsequent opening and operation of a church building, school building, or alcoholic treatment facility within the
                  distances prohibited in this section shall not prevent the continued operation of the establishment pursuant to the
                  license or the renewal of the license or the issuance of a new license to any subsequent owner of such
                  establishment as long as the business operation of the establishment does not cease as set forth in section 3-156

                  The holder of title to any property making up a church building, school building, or alcoholic treatment facility
                  may waive the distance requirements of this section as they apply to such facility in any specific instance by
                  recording in the real estate records in the office of the clerk of superior court of the county, a written instrument
                  evidencing such waiver and setting out the terms thereof, which instrument shall be executed and witnessed with
                  the same formalities as a deed filed for record in the clerk's office.
                  (f)
                  Nothing in this section shall prohibit the city council from amending this section, adding additional special
                  commercial growth centers nor amending any distance requirements in the future.

                  taxes due the state, city, and/or county by the applicant, or upon the property on which the establishment is to be

                  In case of the death of a licensee who is the sole licensee, the establishment for which the license was issued
                  shall be allowed to continue to sell alcoholic beverages in accordance with the terms of the license for a period of
                  forty-five (45) days from the date of death of the licensee or until approval of a new licensee, whichever shall
                  first occur; provided, however, that no sale of alcoholic beverages shall be allowed after the seventh day after the
                  date of death of the licensee until such time as a personal representative of the estate of the deceased licensee,
                  appointed by a probate court of competent jurisdiction, shall have registered with the city clerk on forms
                  prepared by the city clerk. Such personal representative shall be subject to all of the requirements that applied to
                  the deceased licensee, and shall agree in writing to operate the establishment during the interim period in
                  accordance with the terms of the license and the laws of the state and city.
                  (c)
                  In the case of licenses issued jointly to partnerships and certain partners, corporations and certain officers or
                  stockholders, private clubs and certain officers or other entities and certain persons related thereto as set forth in
                  section 3-150, if one (1) of the joint holders of such a license severs his association with the establishment
                  operated pursuant to the license, the establishment may continue to sell alcoholic beverages for a period of fortyfive (45) days from the date determined by the city clerk to be the date of severance, provided no such sale shall
                  be authorized until such time as an application to substitute the person taking the place of the departing person as
                  a joint holder of the license is made by the appropriate person. If the change is one which results from a change
                  in control of the licensee, partnership, corporation or other business entity, then an application for a new license

                  58/414
                  must be filed. Upon issuance of a new license, the authorization to sell under the previous license shall be
                  revoked by operation of law.
                  (d)
                  Any change in the ownership of a licensee which is not a natural person which would change the ownership
                  information furnished on the most recently updated application for the license must be reported to the city clerk
                  within ten (10) days following the occurrence of such change in ownership. If such change in ownership results
                  in an additional person being required to be a joint licensee under section 3-148, or an additional person being
                  listed on the application, but not as a joint licensee, the license may be revoked if any such person fails to meet
                  the qualifications required by this article. If such change in ownership results in a change in control of the
                  business entity which is a joint licensee, then a new application must be filed for the issuance of a new license. If
                  an application for a new license is filed within seven (7) days of the date on which the change in control
                  occurred, then the establishment may continue to operate under the old license for a period of forty-five (45)
                  days from the date of the change in control or until the new license is issued or denied, whichever shall occur
                  first.
                  (e)
                  If substantially all of the assets of an establishment operated pursuant to a license under this article are sold,
                  conveyed or otherwise transferred by the licensee, and if an application for a new license is filed with the city
                  clerk within seven (7) days of such sale or transfer, the establishment may continue to be operated under the then
                  existing license for a period of forty-five (45) days or until a new license is issued or denied to the new owner,
                  whichever shall occur first.
                  (f)
                  Under no circumstances shall a license be transferred where the original holder of the license is under
                  suspension.

                  Any licensee who shall, for a period of two (2) consecutive months after the license under this article has been
                  issued, cease to operate the business of selling alcoholic beverages as authorized in the license shall, after the
                  two-month period, automatically forfeit the license without the necessity of any further action. If the business
                  operation of selling alcoholic beverages is interrupted as a result of damage to the premises which is being
                  repaired or because the premises is being remodeled, then this section shall not apply to such cessation of
                  operation. If a license is issued for the operation of an establishment in a building which has not yet been
                  completed, the license will not be forfeited unless the licensee fails to begin operations within a period of one
                  hundred eighty (180) days from the date of issuance of the license.

                  All licenses granted under this article shall expire on December 31 of each year. Licensees who desire to renew
                  their license shall file application with the city clerk on the form provided for renewal of the license for the
                  ensuing year. Applications for renewal must be filed on or before October 31 of each year. If a renewal
                  application is received after October 31, the city cannot assure the applicant that a renewal license will be issued
                  by January 1 and the licensee will have to cease the sale of alcoholic beverages from January 1 until the renewal
                  license is issued. If a license renewal application is received after December 31, such application shall be treated

                  fees for the granting of licenses as if no previous license had been issued.
                  (b)
                  Any person applying for renewal of a license must pay the license, administrative and investigative fees at the
                  time of filing the application. Failure to pay such fees at that time shall result in the application for renewal being
                  treated as not filed or withdrawn.

                  eligibility of an applicant, may require a licensee or an applicant for a license under this article to provide the
                  city clerk with audited financial statements of the licensee or applicant for such period as the city clerk may
                  determine. The city clerk shall also have the authority to conduct an audit of the books and records of a licensee
                  or an applicant. If the city clerk deems it necessary to conduct such an audit, the city clerk shall so notify the
                  licensee or applicant of the date, time and place of the audit. The city clerk shall designate the person to perform
                  such audit. The licensee shall cooperate with such audit or forfeit all licenses issued under this article. If an
                  applicant for a license fails to cooperate with an audit, the application shall be deemed withdrawn.

                  execution against the delinquent person and his property for the amount of the delinquent fee or tax. The failure
                  to pay any taxes or fees shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and the license of the business to sell alcohol

                  (f)
                  The city council may suspend or revoke any license under this article when the licensee does not meet the

                  an employee of the establishment operated pursuant to a license working in some aspect of the sale of alcoholic
                  beverages who willingly or knowingly performed any act, which constitutes a violation of federal or state law or
                  this chapter will subject the licensee to suspension or revocation of his license when the city council determines
                  that the act or omission did occur, regardless of whether any criminal prosecution or conviction ensues;
                  provided, however, that in the case of a manager or employee, the city council must determine that the acts of the
                  manager or employee were known to or, under reasonable circumstances, should have been known to the
                  licensee, or were condoned by the licensee, or that the licensee had not established reasonable practices or

                  longer maintains adequate financial strength or responsibility upon which issuance of the license was based or
                  whenever the licensee has defaulted in any obligation of any kind whatsoever lawfully owing to the city.
                  (i)
                  A license under this article may be suspended or revoked whenever the city council determines that the
                  establishment operated pursuant to the license has been the scene of repeated incidents of violence resulting in
                  injury to a person or damage to property or a disturbance of the peace or requiring the intervention of law
                  enforcement officers on the scene of a single incident of severe violence resulting in the death of a person or
                  serious injury to a person requiring inpatient hospital care for the injured person.

                  Upon completion of any period of suspension, a license under this article shall not be reinstated until the licensee
                  has paid the city a reinstatement fee equal to the original license fee for that calendar year. In addition, the
                  licensee shall pay the administrative and investigative fees and update all license application forms.

                  (a)
                  Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, or unless waived by the licensee, no license under this article shall be
                  suspended or revoked without the opportunity for a hearing as provided in this section.
                  (b)
                  The city clerk shall provide written notice to the licensee of the initiation of an action to suspend or revoke a
                  license. Such written notification shall set forth, in reasonable detail, the reasons for such action and shall notify
                  the licensee of the right to a hearing under the provisions of this section. Any licensee against whom action for
                  the suspension or revocation of a license is initiated may have a hearing concerning such action before the city
                  council or a committee thereof designated by the city council. Such hearing shall be by written request, filed in
                  the office of the city clerk within twenty (20) days after the date of the notice of the initiation of the action from
                  the city clerk to the licensee. Such written request shall set forth the reasons why the licensee feels that the
                  proposed action should not be taken and, in reasonable detail, the grounds and facts which the licensee contends
                  support the licensee's position. The city council shall determine whether or not the license shall be temporarily
                  suspended during the period prior to the hearing and until action is taken by the city council or its designated
                  committee. Failure of the licensee to request a hearing within the time specified shall be deemed to be a waiver
                  by the licensee of a right to a hearing, and the city council shall be authorized to proceed with final action on the
                  matter without the holding of a hearing.
                  (c)
                  The city council, by resolution, may assign the duties of conducting a hearing to a committee of the city council.

                  A hearing, if requested, shall be held within forty-five (45) days of the date of filing the request for a hearing
                  with the city clerk. At such hearing the licensee shall have the right to be represented by an attorney, at the
                  expense of the licensee, and to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

                  The action of the city council or its committee shall be forwarded to the city clerk within fifteen (15) days after
                  the conclusion of the hearing, and the city clerk shall notify the licensee by certified mail, return receipt
                  requested, of the action taken by the city council or its committee.
                  (f)

                  A retail consumption dealer which is an indoor commercial recreational establishment shall not sell alcoholic
                  beverages at any time that such dealer is having a promotion or event for which it can reasonably be anticipated

                  money or any other thing of value on the premises of any retail consumption dealer. No retail consumption
                  dealer shall permit in his establishment slot machines, pinball machines or similar machines which require a

                  the sale on the premises of any retail consumption dealer of state lottery tickets, cards or games which are legally
                  sold under the laws of the state.

                  (a)
                  Alcoholic beverage sales can be made by a retail consumption dealer in a patio/open area type environment if the
                  retail consumption dealer has been approved to do so by the city clerk.

                  63/414
                  (b)
                  To obtain such approval, the patio/open area must be enclosed by a permanent structure providing for public
                  ingress/egress only through the main structure on the premises covered by the license. The purpose of this
                  requirement is to prevent a customer from leaving the outside sales area with an open drink container without the
                  licensee's knowledge.
                  (c)
                  The height of the enclosing structure shall be a minimum of four (4) feet above ground level. Such enclosing
                  structure does not have to be solid, nor does it have to restrict visibility into or out of the patio/open sales area.
                  Such enclosing structure must be permitted and approved by the engineering services department.
                  (d)
                  There must be an approved emergency fire exit (not for general public use unless an emergency exists) from the
                  patio/open sales area which should be of the type that sounds an alarm so that the licensee will be alerted in the
                  event of unauthorized use when no emergency exists.
                  (e)
                  If a licensee desires a patio/open sales area inside an existing structure, plans will be reviewed and approved on
                  an individual basis by the city clerk. Interior-type patio/open sales areas must also meet the requirements of the
                  city's planning, zoning, engineering and fire codes, and any applicable codes of the state.
                  (f)
                  Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, if the retail consumption dealer is an outdoor
                  commercial recreational establishment, alcoholic beverage sales can be made outdoors in the open, provided that
                  such alcoholic beverages must be consumed on the premises of the outdoor commercial recreational
                  establishment and may not be carried off of such premises.

                  No person shall leave the building in which alcoholic beverages are sold with open alcoholic beverage containers
                  unless such person is in a patio/open sales area which is approved in accordance with section 3-189. It is the
                  licensee's responsibility to ensure that no open alcoholic beverage containers are carried out of the building in
                  violation of this section.
                  (b)
                  People shall not gather outside any building in which alcoholic beverages are sold and consume alcoholic
                  beverages or loiter and mill about. It shall be the responsibility of the licensee operating the business in such
                  building to prevent such gatherings.
                  (c)
                  Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, a person purchasing an alcoholic beverage at an outdoor
                  commercial recreational establishment which is a retail consumption dealer may leave the building in which such
                  alcoholic beverage is sold and may consume such alcoholic beverage outdoors or may purchase and consume
                  such alcoholic beverage outdoors, provided that the alcoholic beverage must be consumed on the premises of the
                  outdoor commercial recreational establishment and may not be carried off of such premises.

                  by the patron of any drink, whether an alcoholic beverage or nonalcoholic beverage.

                  (4)
                  Increase the volume of alcohol contained in a drink without proportionately increasing the price regularly
                  charged for such alcoholic beverage;
                  (5)
                  Encourage or permit on the premises any game or contest which involves the drinking of alcoholic beverages or
                  the awarding of alcoholic beverages as a prize; and
                  (6)
                  Sell, offer to sell, furnish or cause to be furnished any alcoholic beverages for a price less than the cost of the
                  ingredients to the licensee.

                  evade sections 3-251â3-256 or rules and regulations, a penalty of twenty-five (25) percent of the amount
                  required to be paid by the person, exclusive of penalties, shall be added thereto in addition to the fifteen (15)
                  percent penalty provided in section 3-254(d).
                  (e)
                  Giving of notice; manner of service. Promptly after making his determination, the city clerk shall give to the

                  (Ord. No. 147, 11-11-02)
                  Sec. 3-256. - Collection.
                  (a)
                  Security. Whenever the city clerk deems it necessary to ensure compliance with sections 3-251â3-256, he may
                  require any person subject to such sections to deposit with him such security as the city clerk may determine.
                  The amount of the security shall be fixed by the city clerk, but shall not be greater than twice the person's
                  estimated average liability for the period for which he files returns, determined in such a manner as the city clerk
                  deems proper, or ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), whichever amount is the lesser. The amount of the security
                  may be increased by the city clerk subject to the limitations provided in this section. The city clerk may sell the
                  security at public auction, with the approval of the city council, if it becomes necessary to do so in order to
                  recover any tax or any amount required to be collected, interest or penalty due. Notice of the sale may be served
                  upon the person who deposited the security personally or by mail. If service is by mail, it shall be made in the
                  manner prescribed for service of a notice of determined deficiency and shall be addressed to the person at his
                  address as it appears in the records of the city clerk. Upon any sale, any surplus above the amounts due shall be
                  returned to the person who deposited the security.
                  (b)
                  Notice of delinquency to persons holding credits or property of delinquent; duty of persons so notified. If any
                  person is delinquent in the payment of the amount required to be paid by him, or if a delinquency determination
                  has been made against him which remains unpaid, the city clerk may, not later than three (3) years after the
                  payment became delinquent, give notice thereof by registered mail to all persons in the city having in their
                  possession or under their control any credits or other personal property belonging to the delinquent, or owing any
                  debts to the delinquent. After receiving the notice, the persons so notified shall neither transfer nor make any
                  other disposition of the credits, other personal property or debts in their possession or under their control at the
                  time they receive the notice until the city clerk consents to a transfer or disposition, or until twenty (20) days
                  elapse after the receipt of the notice. All persons so notified shall, within five (5) days after receipt of the notice,
                  advise the city clerk of all of the credits, other personal property or debts in their possession, under their control
                  or owing by them.
                  (c)
                  Action for tax collection. At any time within three (3) years after any tax or any amount of tax required to be
                  collected under this article becomes due and payable, and at any time within three (3) years after the delinquency
                  of any tax or any amount of tax required to be collected under this article, the city clerk may bring an action in
                  the courts of this state, any other state or of the United States in the name of city to collect the amount
                  delinquent, together with penalties and interest, court fees, filing fees, attorney's fees and other legal fees incident
                  thereto.
                  (d)
                  Duty of successors or assignees of licensee to withhold tax from purchase money. If any licensee liable for any
                  amount under sections 3-251â3-256 sells out his business or quits the business, his successors or assigns shall
                  withhold a sufficient amount of the purchase price to cover such amount until the former owner produces a
                  receipt from the city clerk showing that he has been paid or a certificate stating that no amount is due.
                  (e)
                  Liability for failure to withhold; certificate of notice of amount due; time to enforce successor's liability. If the
                  purchaser of a business fails to withhold the purchase price as required, he becomes personally liable for the
                  payment of the amount required to be withheld by him to the extent of the purchase price valued in money.
                  Within thirty (30) days after receiving a written request from the purchaser for a certificate, the city clerk shall
                  5/10/2019 Grovetown, GA Code of Ordinances
                  73/414
                  either issue the certificate or mail notice to the purchaser at his address, as it appears on the records of the city
                  clerk, of the amount that must be paid as a condition of issuing the certificate. The time within which the
                  obligation of the successor may be enforced shall begin at the time the licensee sells out his business or at the
                  time that the determination against the licensee becomes final, whichever occurs later.
                  (f)
                  Refund of tax, penalty or interest paid more than once or illegally collected. Whenever the amount of any tax,
                  penalty or interest has been paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the
                  city under sections 3-251â3-256, it may be offset as provided in section 3-254(c) or it may be refunded
                  provided a verified claim in writing therefor, stating the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is
                  filed with the city clerk within three (3) years from the date of payment. The claim shall be audited and shall be
                  made on forms provided by the city clerk. If the claim is approved by the city clerk and the city council, the
                  excess amount collected or paid may be refunded or may be credited on any amounts then due and payable from
                  the person from whom it was collected or by whom paid, and the balance may be refunded to such person, his
                  administrators or executors.
                  (g)
                  The city council or its designated committee may decline to issue a license under this article when any person
                  having any ownership interest in or control over the land or building in which the establishment to be operated
                  pursuant to the license will be located does not meet the same character requirements as set forth in this section
                  for the licensee.
                  (h)
                  If a person in whose name a license under this article is issued is not a county resident, such person must appoint
                  and continuously maintain in the county a registered agent upon whom any process, notice or demand required
                  or permitted by law or under this article may be served. The registered agent must be a resident of the county. If
                  the licensee is not a natural person, it will be required to appoint and maintain a registered agent in the county if
                  it does not have in the county any agent upon whom process can legally be served for such entity under the laws
                  of the state. The licensee shall file the name of such registered agent, along with the written consent to serve of
                  such agent, with the city clerk.
                  (i)
                  An application for a license under this article may be denied where it appears to the city council or its designated
                  committee that the applicant does not have adequate financial strength, adequate financial participation in the
                  proposed business to direct and manage its affairs, or where it appears that the applicant is intended or is likely to
                  be a surrogate for a person who would not otherwise qualify for a license under this article.
                  (j)
                  The city council or its designated committee, in its discretion, may consider any extenuating circumstances
                  which may reflect favorably or unfavorably on the applicant, the application or the proposed location of the
                  establishment. If, in the city council's or the committee's judgment, circumstances are such that issuing of a
                  license under this article would not be in the best interest of the general public, such circumstances may be
                  grounds for denying the application.

                  any animal in or upon any vehicle in a cruel or inhumane manner. Any animal habitually kept outside shall be

                  department may impound such diseased or painfully crippled animal, and all such animals impounded may be
                  disposed of humanely as soon thereafter as conveniently possible. In the case of humane disposition of such
                  animal, the animal control department shall not be required to give any notice. This section shall not be
                  construed to include veterinary hospitals or animals under active veterinary care.

                  Authority of animal control department in case of animal neglect: Whenever the animal control board finds that
                  any animal is or will be without proper care because of injury, illness, incarceration or other voluntary absence of
                  the owner or person responsible for the care of such animal, or because of the failure, refusal or neglect of the
                  owner or person responsible for the care of such animal to provide proper care, the animal control department
                  may pick up such animal for protective care; and in the event of sickness or injury, the animal control department
                  may take such action as called for to prevent undue pain and suffering, including immediate humane disposal of
                  the animal.

                  feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. For secondary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at
                  least fifty (50) horizontal feet, but the director may grant variances to no less than twenty-five (25) feet.
                  Regardless of whether a trout stream is primary or secondary, for first order trout waters, which are streams into
                  which no other streams flow except for springs, the buffer shall be at least twenty-five (25) horizontal feet, and
                  no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. The minimum requirements of O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-6(b) and the
                  buffer zones provided by this subsection shall be enforced by the local issuing authority;
                  (5)
                  Agricultural operations as defined in O.C.G.A. Â§ 1-3-3, "definitions," to include raising, harvesting or storing of
                  products of the field or orchard; feeding, breeding or managing livestock or poultry; producing or storing feed for
                  use in the production of livestock, including but not limited to cattle, calves, swine, hogs, goats, sheep, and
                  rabbits or for use in the production of poultry, including but not limited to chickens, hens and turkeys; producing
                  plants, trees, fowl, or animals; the production of aqua culture, horticultural, dairy, livestock, poultry, eggs and
                  apiarian products; farm buildings and farm ponds;
                  (6)
                  Forestry land management practices, including harvesting; provided, however, that when such exempt forestry
                  practices cause or result in land-disturbing or other activities otherwise prohibited in a buffer, as established in
                  subsections 5-24(15) and (16), no other land-disturbing activities, except for normal forest management
                  practices, shall be allowed on the entire property upon which the forestry practices were conducted for a period
                  of three (3) years after completion of such forestry practices;

                  Any project carried out under the technical supervision of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
                  of the United States Department of Agriculture;
                  (8)
                  Any project involving less than one (1) acre of disturbed area; provided, however, that this exemption shall not
                  apply to any land-disturbing activity within a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned
                  disturbance of equal to or greater than one (1) acre or within two hundred (200) feet of the bank of any state
                  waters, and for purposes of this paragraph. "State waters" excludes channels and drainage ways which have
                  water in them only during and immediately after rainfall events and intermittent streams which do not have water
                  in them year-round; provided, however, that any person responsible for a project which involves less than one (1)
                  acre, which involves land-disturbing activity, and which is within two hundred (200) feet of any such excluded
                  channel or drainage way, must prevent sediment from moving beyond the boundaries of the property on which
                  such project is located and provided, further, that nothing contained herein shall prevent the local issuing
                  authority from regulating any such project which is not specifically exempted by subsections (1), (2), (3), (4),
                  (5), (6), (7), (9) or (10) of this section;
                  (9)
                  Construction or maintenance projects, or both, undertaken or financed in whole or in part, or both, by the
                  Department of Transportation, the Georgia Highway Authority, or the State Road and Tollway Authority; or any
                  road construction or maintenance project, or both, undertaken by any county or municipality; provided, however,
                  that construction or maintenance projects of the department of transportation or the State Road and Tollway
                  Authority which disturb one (1) or more contiguous acres of land shall be subject to provisions of O.C.G.A. Â§
                  12-7-7.1; except where the department of transportation, the Georgia Highway Authority, or the State Road and
                  Tollway Authority is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or
                  sale under the state general permit, in which case a copy of a notice of intent under the state general permit shall
                  be submitted to the local issuing authority, the local issuing authority shall enforce compliance with the
                  minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be
                  subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders;
                  (10)
                  Any land-disturbing activities conducted by any electric membership corporation or municipal electrical system
                  or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the public service commission, any utility under the
                  regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as defined in
                  O.C.G.A. Â§ 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United States engaged in the generation,
                  transmission, or distribution of power; except where an electric membership corporation or municipal electrical
                  system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the public service commission, any utility under
                  the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as defined
                  in O.C.G.A. Â§ 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United States engaged in the generation,

                  Sec. 5-24. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management
                  practices.
                  5/10/2019 Grovetown, GA Code of Ordinances
                  97/414
                  (a)
                  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing
                  activities if requirements of the article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those
                  land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil
                  erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into
                  the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control
                  measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections 5-24(b) and (c). The
                  application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility
                  installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to
                  prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in
                  accordance with requirements of this ordinance and the NPDES general permit.
                  (b)
                  Minimum requirements/BMPs.
                  (1)
                  Best management practices as set forth in subsections 5-24(b) and (c) shall be required for all land-disturbing
                  activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete
                  defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this
                  subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued
                  pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this subsection the
                  terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design
                  specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. Â§
                  12-7-6(b).
                  (2)
                  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly
                  designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a
                  local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-5-30(f),
                  the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of
                  receiving waters being increased by more than twenty-five (25) nephelometric turbidity units for waters
                  supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten (10) nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as
                  trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued
                  by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of singlefamily homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance
                  for such construction is equal to or greater than five (5) acres.
                  (3)
                  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any landdisturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division
                  pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure
                  occurs.
                  (4)
                  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent
                  monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur.
                  (5)

                  98/414
                  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in (c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-
                  6(c).
                  (c)
                  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-1 et seq. for the
                  purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as
                  the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices
                  to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent
                  than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the
                  Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing
                  activity was permitted, as well as the following:
                  (1)
                  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to
                  minimize erosion;
                  (2)
                  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
                  (3)
                  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion
                  potential;
                  (4)
                  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
                  (5)
                  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
                  (6)
                  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
                  (7)
                  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
                  (8)
                  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable;
                  (9)
                  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins,
                  silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is
                  stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-
                  1 et seq.;
                  (10)
                  5/10/2019 Grovetown, GA Code of Ordinances
                  99/414
                  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or
                  the sloping of fills;
                  (11)
                  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
                  (12)
                  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect
                  other property owners;
                  (13)
                  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are
                  not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum;
                  (14)
                  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for
                  treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments
                  on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 5-24(b)(2);
                  (15)
                  Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a twenty-five-foot buffer along the
                  banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal
                  stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective
                  of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-2-
                  8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate
                  erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along
                  any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal
                  circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the
                  channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and
                  for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral
                  stream, the buffers of at least twenty-five (25) feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title
                  12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as
                  provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
                  a.
                  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural,
                  undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the
                  final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective
                  vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient
                  quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family
                  residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy,
                  may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water
                  quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
                  b.
                  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as
                  measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a
                  width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are
                  5/10/2019 Grovetown, GA Code of Ordinances
                  100/414
                  incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines;
                  or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and
                  (16)
                  There is established a fifty-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been
                  wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams"
                  pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway
                  drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout
                  streams which discharge an average annual flow of twenty-five (25) gallons per minute or less shall have a
                  twenty-five-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule
                  providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the
                  downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout
                  streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that
                  adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented.
                  The following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
                  a.
                  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural,
                  undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once
                  the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a
                  protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in
                  sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a singlefamily residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own
                  occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to
                  protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the
                  stream bed; and
                  b.
                  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as
                  measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a
                  width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are
                  incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines;
                  or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines.
                  (d)
                  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and
                  regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum
                  requirements in subsections 5-24(b) and (c).
                  (e)
                  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of
                  another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in

                  (b)
                  Application requirements.
                  (1)
                  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of
                  Grovetown without first obtaining a permit from the City of Grovetown to perform such activity and providing a
                  copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable.
                  (2)
                  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the City of Grovetown and must include the applicant's
                  erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as
                  a minimum, the data specified in subsection 5-25(c) of this article. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control
                  plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed
                  will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 5-24(b) and (c) of this article will be met.
                  Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three (3) copies of the applicant's erosion,
                  sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan
                  preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-
                  7-.10.
                  (3)
                  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of
                  O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed eighty dollars ($80.00) per acre of land-disturbing
                  activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general
                  permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of
                  development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction
                  that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division;
                  except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10)
                  of O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing
                  authority in the jurisdiction.
                  (4)
                  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the
                  application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the
                  erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within thirtyfive (35) days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval
                  of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit
                  will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 5-24(c)
                  (15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per section 5-25(b)(6), have
                  been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an
                  5/10/2019 Grovetown, GA Code of Ordinances
                  102/414
                  agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without
                  referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall
                  approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing
                  authority with plan review authority to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the
                  revised plan submittal.
                  (5)
                  If a permit applicant has had two (2) or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the Erosion and
                  Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three (3) years prior to the date of filing the application under
                  consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application.
                  (6)
                  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security,
                  cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, three thousand dollars
                  ($3,000.00) per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the
                  applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing
                  authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to
                  stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply
                  unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any
                  determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations.
                  (c)
                  Plan requirements.
                  (1)

                  or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and
                  engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by
                  reference into this ordinance. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the
                  soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent
                  structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities,
                  local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of
                  the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction,
                  monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification
                  requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission
                  and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-20.
                  (2)
                  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation
                  and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which
                  the land-disturbing activity was permitted.

                  (1)
                  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than forty-five (45) days after
                  receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained,
                  where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include
                  conditions under which the activity may be undertaken.
                  (2)
                  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control
                  plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is
                  in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 5-24(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding
                  requirements, if necessary, as per section 5-25(b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect
                  within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for
                  denial shall be furnished to the applicant.
                  (3)
                  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this
                  article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division
                  shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority.
                  (4)
                  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase.
                  (5)
                  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the
                  land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the
                  approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this
                  article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected
                  by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit.
                  (6)
                  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two (2) or more violations of previous permits

                  Sec. 5-26. - Inspection and enforcement.
                  (a)
                  The City of Grovetown will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have
                  been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures
                  required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall
                  regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary
                  permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary
                  permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and
                  maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing
                  activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is
                  conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in landdisturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or
                  5/10/2019 Grovetown, GA Code of Ordinances
                  104/414
                  with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall
                  set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must
                  be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he
                  shall be deemed in violation of this article.
                  (b)
                  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within twelve (12) months of any
                  amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975.
                  (c)
                  The city shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out
                  duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or
                  private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities.
                  (d)
                  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the
                  commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents
                  appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in
                  the process of carrying out his official duties.
                  (e)
                  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities
                  which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-8(a). The district or the
                  commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving
                  the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The
                  district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or
                  ineffective local program is found.
                  (f)
                  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as
                  local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to,
                  review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance
                  with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the
                  governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-8(a) has not
                  administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement
                  entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or
                  municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have ninety (90)
                  days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the
                  county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within ninety (90) days after notification by the
                  division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  Sec. 5-27. - Penalties and incentives.
                  (a)
                  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity
                  requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this ordinance without first obtaining said permit, the person
                  shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a
                  business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority.

                  (b)
                  Stop-work orders.
                  (1)
                  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall
                  issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five (5) days to correct the violation. If the
                  violation is not corrected within five (5) days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work
                  order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has
                  occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the
                  state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the
                  local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning;
                  (2)
                  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate
                  stop-work order; and
                  (3)
                  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary
                  corrective action or mitigation has occurred.
                  (4)
                  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant
                  amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have
                  been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly
                  designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the
                  director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall
                  be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to
                  all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or
                  permanent erosion and sediment controls.
                  (c)
                  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has
                  failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice
                  shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which
                  such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within
                  the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be
                  deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 5-25(b)
                  (6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to
                  hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance.
                  (d)
                  Monetary penalties.
                  (1)
                  Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant
                  to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of
                  the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed two thousand five
                  hundred dollars ($2,500.00) per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding

                  106/414
                  any provisions in any city charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to
                  exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law
                  as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court

                  (a)
                  Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspection or any
                  land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on their level
                  of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission in consultation with the division and the

                  certification requirements of O.C.G.A. Â§ 12-7-19(b)(1), then any person or entity involved in land-disturbing
                  activity at that site and operating in a subcontractor capacity for such permittee shall meet those educational
                  requirements specified in O.C.G.A Â§ 12-7-19(b)(4) and shall not be required to meet any educational
                  requirements that exceed those specified in said paragraph.

                  (a)
                  Authorization. Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. Â§ 36-1-20(a) have
                  delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public
                  5/10/2019 Grovetown, GA Code of Ordinances
                  108/414
                  health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
                  (b)
                  Findings of fact.
                  (1)
                  The flood hazard areas of the City of Grovetown, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss
                  of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
                  public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect
                  the public health, safety and general welfare.
                  (2)
                  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are
                  inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect
                  of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
                  (c)
                  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and
                  to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
                  (1)
                  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood
                  damage at the time of initial construction;
                  (2)
                  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or
                  which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
                  (3)
                  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
                  (4)
                  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may
                  increase flood hazards to other lands; and
                  (5)
                  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved
                  in the accommodation of floodwaters.
                  (d)
                  Objectives. The objectives of this article are:
                  (1)
                  To protect human life and health;

                  109/414
                  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer
                  lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
                  (3)
                  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a
                  manner as to minimize flood blight areas;
                  (4)
                  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
                  (5)
                  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the
                  expense of the general public;
                  (6)
                  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and
                  (7)
                  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  (b)
                  Basis for area of special flood hazard. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency
                  Management Agency in its Flood Insurance Study (FIS), dated September 19, 2007, with accompanying maps
                  and other supporting data and any revision thereto, are adopted by reference and declared a part of this article.
                  For those land areas acquired by a municipality through annexation, the current effective FIS dated September
                  19, 2007, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, for the City of
                  Grovetown, Georgia are hereby adopted by reference.
                  Areas of special flood hazard may also include those areas known to have flooded historically or defined through
                  standard engineering analysis by governmental agencies or private parties but not yet incorporated in a FIS.
                  The repository for public inspection of the Flood Insurance Study (FIS), accompanying maps and other
                  supporting data is located in the Grovetown City Hall, 103 Wrightsboro Road, Grovetown, Georgia.
                  (c)
                  Establishment of development permit. A development permit shall be required in conformance with the
                  provisions of this article prior to the commencement of any development activities.

                  Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or altered without full
                  compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations.
                  (e)
                  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
                  ordinance, easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance and another conflict or
                  overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
                  (f)
                  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this article all provisions shall be: (1) considered as
                  minimum requirements; (2) liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and; (3) deemed neither to limit
                  nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.
                  (g)
                  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered
                  reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
                  and will occur; flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This article does not imply that
                  land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or
                  flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the city or by any officer or employee thereof
                  for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made
                  hereunder.

                  DIVISION 3. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
                  Sec. 5-46. - General standards.
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required:
                  (1)
                  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation,
                  collapse or lateral movement of the structure;
                  (2)
                  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and
                  utility equipment resistant to flood damage;
                  (3)
                  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and
                  practices that minimize flood damage;
                  (4)
                  Elevated buildings - All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any
                  fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be
                  designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize
                  hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater.
                  (a)
                  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or
                  meet the following minimum criteria:
                  (i)
                  Provide a minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every
                  square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
                  (ii)
                  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade; and
                  (iii)
                  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the
                  automatic flow of floodwater in both directions.
                  (b)
                  5/10/2019 Grovetown, GA Code of Ordinances
                  114/414
                  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only
                  be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises,
                  or entry to the elevated area; and
                  (c)
                  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
                  (5)
                  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation,
                  plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or
                  accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding;
                  (6)
                  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring
                  may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in
                  addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces;
                  (7)
                  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood
                  waters into the system;
                  (8)
                  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood
                  waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters;
                  (9)
                  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination
                  from them during flooding; and
                  (10)
                  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions
                  of this article, shall be undertaken only if the non-conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.
                  (Ord. No. 187, 10-8-07)
                  Sec. 5-47. - Specific standards.
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required:
                  (1)
                  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new
                  construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor,
                  including basement, elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation
                  perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic
                  forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 5-46(4),
                  "elevated buildings."

                  5/10/2019 Grovetown, GA Code of Ordinances
                  115/414
                  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation,
                  plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one (1) foot above the base flood elevation.
                  (2)
                  Non-residential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in
                  A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility
                  and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation, with
                  walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of
                  resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or
                  architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of
                  practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above
                  and in section 5-45(6).
                  (3)
                  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available:
                  (a)
                  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new
                  and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing
                  manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision
                  where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest
                  floor including basement, elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation.
                  (b)
                  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision
                  may be elevated so that either:
                  (i)
                  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the level of the base
                  flood elevation, or
                  (ii)
                  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at
                  least an equivalent strength) of no less than thirty-six (36) inches in height above grade.
                  (c)
                  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
                  flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. section 5-46(6))
                  (d)
                  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
                  (i)
                  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days.
                  (ii)
                  5/10/2019 Grovetown, GA Code of Ordinances
                  116/414
                  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on
                  its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and
                  has no permanently attached structures or additions); or
                  (iii)
                  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring and
                  elevation requirements of section 5-47(3)(a)â(c).
                  (4)
                  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 5-41(b) are areas designated as
                  floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion
                  potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base
                  flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
                  (a)
                  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other
                  development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is
                  demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering
                  practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base
                  flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification
                  thereof.
                  (b)
                  Only if section 5-47(a)(4) above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply
                  with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 3.

                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 5-41(b), where streams exist but no base
                  flood data have been provided (A-zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not
                  been delineated, the following provisions apply:
                  (1)
                  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 5-41(b),
                  then the city engineer shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation
                  and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of
                  division 3. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2) and (3) shall
                  apply:
                  (2)
                  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the
                  stream or twenty (20) feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification
                  by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more
                  than a one (1) foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

                  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements
                  of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no
                  less than three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (NOTE: Require the lowest floor to
                  be elevated one (1) foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-zone areas where a limited detail study
                  has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be
                  provided in accordance with standards of section 5-46(4), "elevated buildings."
                  (a)
                  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation,
                  plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three (3) feet above the highest adjacent
                  grade at the building site.
                  The city engineer shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of
                  the permit file.

                  facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 5-
                  46(4), "elevated buildings".
                  The city engineer shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of
                  the permit file.
                  (2)
                  New construction or the substantial improvement of a non-residential structure may be flood-proofed in lieu of
                  elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight
                  to the specified FIRM flood level plus one (1) foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially
                  impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic
                  and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify
                  that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the

                  camping, travel, or seasonal use.
                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of
                  construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit
                  date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of
                  slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and
                  includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial
                  land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
                  walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of
                  temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted
                  structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure.) (NOTE:
                  accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual
                  start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
                  whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or
                  liquid storage tank.
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the
                  structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the
                  structure before the damage occurred.
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure,
                  taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the
                  market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of
                  the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or
                  improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term
                  includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual amount of repair work
                  performed.
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of
                  any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects
                  the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a
                  structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
                  specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the
                  code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a
                  "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
                  "historic structure".
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction,
                  rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of
                  the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner
                  otherwise prohibited by this article.
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's
                  floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other
                  certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such
                  time as that documentation is provided.

                  Sec. 8-44. - Procedure for abatement of nuisances.
                  (a)
                  Whenever a request is filed with the public officer by a public authority or by at least five (5) residents of the city
                  charging that any dwelling, building, or structure is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or
                  business use, or whenever it appears to the public officer (on his own motion) that any dwelling, building, or
                  structure is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use, the public
                  officer shall, if his preliminary investigation discloses a basis for such charges, issue and cause to be served upon
                  the owner of and any parties in interest in such dwelling, building, or structure a complaint stating the charges in
                  that respect and containing a notice that a hearing will be held before the public officer (or his designated agent)
                  at a place within the city in which the property is located therein, fixed not less than ten (10) days nor more than
                  thirty (30) days after the serving of said complaint; that the owner and any parties in interest shall be given the
                  right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person, or otherwise, and give testimony at the place and
                  time fixed in the complaint; and that the rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be
                  controlling in hearings before the public officer;
                  (b)
                  If, after such notice and hearing, the public officer determines that the dwelling, building, or structure under
                  consideration is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use, he
                  shall state in writing his findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served
                  upon the owner thereof an order:
                  (1)
                  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable
                  cost in relation to the value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner or parties in interest,
                  within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure, so as to
                  render it fit for human habitation or for current commercial, industrial, or business use or to vacate and close the
                  dwelling, building, or structure as a human habitation; or
                  (2)
                  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure cannot be made at a
                  reasonable cost in relation to the value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner or parties in
                  interest, within the time specified in the order, to remove or demolish such dwelling, building, or structure.
                  In no event shall the city council require removal or demolition of any dwelling, building, or structure except
                  upon a finding that the cost of repair, alteration, or improvement thereof exceeds one-half (Â½) the value such
                  5/10/2019 Grovetown, GA Code of Ordinances
                  146/414
                  dwelling, building, or structure will have when repaired to satisfy the minimum requirements of this law.
                  (c)
                  If the owner or parties in interest fail to comply with an order to vacate and close or demolish the dwelling,
                  building, or structure, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, or
                  improved or to be vacated and closed or demolished; and that the public officer may cause to be posted on the
                  main entrance of any building, dwelling, or structure so closed a placard with the following words:
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use; the use or occupation of
                  this building for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use is prohibited and unlawful."
                  (d)
                  If the owner fails to comply with any order to remove or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the public
                  officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be removed or demolished; provided, however, that the
                  duties of the public officer, set forth in paragraph (c) of this section and this paragraph, shall not be exercised
                  until the city council shall have by ordinance ordered the public officer to proceed to effectuate the purpose of
                  O.C.G.A. Â§ 41-2-7 through Â§ 41-2-17, with respect to the particular property or properties which the public
                  officer shall have found to be unfit for human habitation or unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or
                  business use, which property or properties shall be described in the ordinances.
                  (e)
                  The amount of the cost of such vacating and closing or removal or demolition by the public officer shall be a lien
                  against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. Said lien shall attach to the real property upon the
                  payment of all costs of demolition by the city council and the filing of an itemized statement of the total sum of
                  said costs by the public officer in the office of the city clerk on a lien docket maintained by said clerk for said
                  purposes. If the dwelling, building, or structure is removed or demolished by the public officer he shall sell the
                  materials of such dwellings, buildings, or structures and shall credit the proceeds of such sale against the cost of
                  the removal or demolition and any balance remaining shall be deposited in the superior court by the public
                  officer, shall be secured in such manner as may be directed by such court, and shall be disbursed by such court to
                  the persons found to be entitled thereto by final order or decree of such court. Nothing in this section shall be
                  construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the municipality to define and declare nuisances and to
                  cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise.
                  (f)
                  The city council may enforce the collection of any amount due on such lien for removal or demolition of
                  dwellings, buildings, or structures only in the following manner:
                  (1)
                  The owner or parties at interest shall be allowed to satisfy the amount due on such lien by paying to the city
                  council within thirty (30) days after the perfection of said lien, a sum of money equal to twenty-five (25) percent
                  of the total amount due and by further paying to city council the remaining balance due on such lien, together
                  with interest at the rate of seven (7) percent per annum, in three (3) equal annual payments, each of which shall
                  become due and payable on the anniversary date of the initial payment made as hereinabove prescribed;
                  (2)
                  Should the property upon which such lien is perfected be sold, transferred, or conveyed by the owner or parties
                  in interest at any time prior to the termination of the said three-year period, then the entire balance due on such
                  lien shall be due and payable to the city council; and
                  (3)
                  5/10/2019 Grovetown, GA Code of Ordinances
                  147/414
                  Should the amount due on such lien, or any portion thereof, be unpaid after the passage of said three-year period,
                  or upon the occurrence of the contingency provided for in subparagraph (f)(2) of this section, the city council
                  may enforce the collection of any amount due on such lien for alteration, repair, removal, or demolition of
                  dwellings, buildings, or structures in the same manner as provided in O.C.G.A. 48-5-358 and other applicable
                  state statutes. This procedure shall be subject to the right of redemption by any person having any right, title or
                  interest in or lien upon said property, all as provided by Article 3 of Chapter 4 of Title 48 of the Official Code of
                  Georgia Annotated.

                  (a)
                  Complaints or orders issued by the public officer pursuant to the provisions of this article shall, in all cases, be
                  served upon each person in possession of said property, each owner, and each party in interest; and the return of
                  service signed by the public officer or his agent or an affidavit of service executed by any citizen of this state,
                  reciting that a copy of such complaint or orders was served upon each person in possession of said property, each
                  owner, and each party in interest personally or by leaving such copy at the place of his residence, shall be
                  sufficient evidence as to the service of such person in possession, owner, and party in interest.
                  (b)
                  If any of the owners and parties in interest shall reside outside the city limits of the city service shall be perfected
                  by causing a copy of such complaint or orders to be served upon such party or parties by the sheriff or any lawful
                  deputy of the county of the residence of such party or parties or such service may be made by any citizen; and
                  the return of such sheriff or lawful deputy or the affidavit of such citizen, that such party or parties were served
                  either personally or by leaving a copy of the complaint or orders at the residence, shall be conclusive as to such
                  service.
                  (c)
                  Nonresidents of this state shall be served by publishing the same once each week for two (2) successive weeks in

                  nonresidents is known, a copy of such complaint or orders shall be mailed to them by registered or certified mail.
                  (d)
                  In the event either the owner or any party in interest is a minor or an insane person or person laboring under
                  disabilities, the guardian or other personal representative of such person shall be served and if such guardian or
                  personal representative resides outside the city limits of the city or is a nonresident, he shall be served as
                  provided for in section 8-45(c) or (d) in such cases. If such minor or insane person or person laboring under

                  personally or by leaving a copy at the place of his residence which shall be sufficient evidence as to the service
                  of such person or persons; in the case of other persons who live outside of the city or are nonresidents, service

                  the public officer in the exercise of reasonable diligence and the public officer shall make an affidavit to that

                  148/414
                  effect, then the service of such complaint or order upon such persons shall be made in the same manner as
                  provided in subsection (c) of this section or service may be perfected upon any person, firm or corporation

                  notice in the county in which the dwelling, building, or structure is located and such filing of the complaint or

                  (a)
                  Ownership and maintenance of the detention ponds will remain with the owner/developer until the pond has been
                  accepted for ownership by the City of Grovetown. Any maintenance, cleaning, or repairs of the detention pond,
                  prior to acceptance by the City of Grovetown, will be at the cost of the owner/developer. After the city has
                  accepted ownership of the pond the city will be responsible for any cost incurred with the maintenance, cleaning,
                  repair of said pond.
                  (b)
                  Maintenance of the detention ponds, once accepted by the city, will include (but not be limited to) annual
                  inspection, clearing of any trash or debris located in the pond, clearing of any trees that may have grown in the
                  pond, clean out of silt accumulation from the pipes in the pond, and repairs/maintenance of any retrofit device in
                  the pond.
                  (c)
                  If a pond exists where the city does not possess ownership of the pond, the city will notify the owner of the pond
                  of the necessary maintenance that may be needed for the proper function of the pond. The owner will be notified
                  by certified return receipt mail and will be allowed thirty (30) days from receipt of notification in which to bring
                  the pond into compliance. If compliance is not met within the thirty-day period, the city will hire a licensed
                  contractor to perform the necessary maintenance until compliance is met. The city will invoice/bill the owner of
                  the pond, or place a lien on the property, until the city has been able to recover any costs that may have incurred
                  to bring the privately owned pond into compliance.
