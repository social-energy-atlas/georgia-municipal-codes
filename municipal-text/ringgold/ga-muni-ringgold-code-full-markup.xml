        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a complete codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Ringgold, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the mayor and city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Ron McLaughlin, Supervising Editor, and John Welch, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Dan Wright, City Manager, and H. Kimbrell Sawyer, III, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.

                  (4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _____ to _____" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code that embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code). 
                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of ordinance sections inserted into the Code, but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
                  Sec. 1-10. - Altering Code.

                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 2-1. - Acceptance of credit card payments for money due the city. 
                  (a)  All sums due the city including, but not limited to, ad valorem taxes, occupation taxes, fines, forfeitures, penalties, license fees, permit fees and registration fees, may be paid by the use of credit cards. The city finance department, with the approval of the city manager, shall establish the procedures for acceptance of credit card payments for amounts due the city. The city manager is authorized to enter into agreements with credit card issuers to facilitate the acceptance of credit card payments by the city. 
                  (b)  A credit card agreement may provide for the acceptance of the credit card payments from the credit card company and for the withholding of administrative fees from the face amount of the payment. Such fee is granted in exchange for the increased public convenience as a result of credit card payments. 
                  (c)  A surcharge equal to the administrative fees charged by the credit card issuer to the city shall be imposed upon any person making a payment by credit card, when such surcharges are permitted by the operating rules and regulations of the credit card issuer. 
                  (d)  Any agreement with a credit card issuer for the acceptance or payments via credit shall contain a provision that the agreement may be canceled at any time by the city. 
                  (e)  No person making payment by credit card to the city is relieved from liability for the underlying obligation except to the extent that the city actually receives final payment of the obligation in cash or its equivalent. If final payment is not made by the credit card issuer or other guarantor of payment in the credit card transaction, the underlying obligation for the money due is not extinguished. All applicable penalties, interest and collection fees on the unpaid amount shall be due from the person making the payment by credit card. 
                  Such penalties, interest and fees on an unpaid amount shall accrue from the date the unpaid obligation was first due under the applicable statute or ordinance.

                  Sec. 2-156. - Findings. 
                  The public judges its government by the way public officials and employees conduct themselves in the posts to which they are elected or appointed. 
                  All government, of right, originates with the people, is founded upon their will only; and is instituted solely for the good of the whole. Public officers are the trustees and servants of the people and are at all times amenable to them. Ga. Const. Art. 1. Sec. 2, Paragraph 1. 
                  The people of this state have the inherent right of regulating their internal government. Government is instituted for the protection, security and benefit of the people; and at all times, they have the right to alter or reform the same, whenever the public good may require it. Ga. Const. Art. 1, Sec. 2, Paragraph 2. 
                  The people have a right to expect that every public official will conduct himself in a manner that will tend to preserve public confidence in and respect for the government he represents. 
                  Such confidence and respect can best be promoted if every public official, whether paid or unpaid, and whether elected or appointed, will uniformly: (a) treat all citizens with courtesy, impartiality, fairness, and equality under the law; and (b) avoid conflicts between their private self-interest and the public interest. 
                  (Ord. No. 2013-0610-02, § 1, 6-10-13) 
                  Sec. 2-157. - Purpose. 
                  Declaration of policy. It is the policy of the city that the proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that governmental decisions and policy be made in proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of these goals, a code of ethics for all city officials is adopted by ordinance. 
                  This code has the following purposes: 
                  (1)  To encourage high ethical standards in official conduct by city officials; 
                  (2)  To establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all such officials by setting forth those acts or actions which are incompatible with the best interest of the city; 
                  (3)  To require disclosure by such officials of private financial or other interest in matters which may affect the city; and 
                  (4)  To serve as a basis for disciplining those who refuse to abide by its terms. The provisions of this division shall not apply to political contributions, loans, expenditures, reports or regulation of political campaigns or the conduct of candidates in such campaigns.

                  Sec. 2-231. - Open records officer. 
                  There is hereby created the office of open records officer. The city clerk is hereby designated as the city's open records officer; the open records officer may designate, in writing, assistant open records officer(s) as required to perform the duties of his or her office. The open records officer shall serve at the pleasure of the mayor and council. 
                  (Ord. No. 2012-0813, § 1, 8-14-12) 
                  Sec. 2-232. - Duties. 
                  It shall be the duty of the open records officer and his or her duly designated assistant open records officer(s) to accept written requests to inspect and copy public records, pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 50-18-70 et seq., and to produce to the requester all records responsive to a request within a reasonable amount of time not to exceed three business days of receipt of a request, unless the time for response is extended in accordance with law. No request shall be deemed filed until served upon the open records officer, either by hand delivery, certified United States mail, return receipt requested, or statutory overnight delivery to the Open Records Officer at City Hall, 150 Tennessee Street, Ringgold, Georgia, 30736; by email to openrecordsringgold@gmail.com; or by facsimile transmission to the Open Records Officer at 706-965-7446. Requests, whether oral or in writing, served upon any other officer or employee of the city shall not be deemed filed, until the requester has filed his or her request, in writing, with the open records officer. In the absence or unavailability of the open records officer, an assistant open records officer shall perform the duties of the open records officer. The absence or unavailability of a designated open records officer shall not delay the city's response to a properly served request. 
                  (Ord. No. 2012-0813, § 1, 8-14-12) 
                  Sec. 2-233. - Request response. 
                  Upon receipt of a request, it shall be the duty of the open records officer to promptly ascertain the availability of all public records responsive to the request and to produce to the requester those records that can be located and produced within a reasonable time, not to exceed three business days of receipt of a request. For purposes of computing the time within which a response must be made, the open records officer shall not count the business day on which a request is received, nor any intervening Saturday, Sunday, or designated holiday on which city offices are closed for general business. Upon intake of a request, the open records officer shall stamp the request with the date and time of receipt, and initial the request. In any instance where records are unavailable within three business days of the request, it shall be the duty of the open records officer to provide the requester with a written description of such records and a timeline for when the records will be available for inspection or copying and to provide the responsive records to the requester as soon thereafter as practicable. Such response shall also contain a good faith estimate of the cost to the requester for the search, retrieval, redaction, and production and copying of records. The open records officer shall confer with every officer or department head of the city, as necessary, to ascertain the existence of public records responsive to a request (including electronically-stored information), and it shall be the duty of every city officer and department head to confer with and provide records, or true and correct copies of the originals thereof, to the open records officer promptly, time being of the essence. Upon receipt of a public record responsive to a request, the open records officer shall determine, in consultation with the city attorney, if the record is exempt from disclosure by order of a court of this state or by law; if the record is exempt from disclosure, the written response by the open records officer shall set forth the specific legal authority under which withholding of inspection of the record is claimed. The open records officer shall maintain a log or other documentation of his or her due diligence to comply with a proper request.

                  Sec. 2-234. - Fees. 
                  The open records officer shall further have the duty to collect from a requester a reasonable charge for the search, retrieval, redaction, and production/copying of records, utilizing the most economical means available to identify and produce non-excluded records. The charge for the search, retrieval, or redaction of records shall not exceed the prorated hourly salary of the lowest paid full-time employee who, in the reasonable discretion of the open records officer, has the necessary skill and training to perform the request; provided, however, no charge shall be made for the first quarter hour. In addition thereto, where certified copies of specific records are sought, the fees for certified copies prescribed by law shall apply; otherwise, a fee for the copying of records shall not exceed $0.10 per page for letter or legal size documents or, in the case of other documents and electronic records, the actual cost of reproducing the document or media on which the records or media are produced. It shall be the right of the requester, at the time of inspection, to make photographic copies or other electronic reproductions of records, at his or her own expense, using suitable portable devices brought to the place of inspection. Whenever any person has requested to inspect and copy public records and received a written response estimating the cost of the search, retrieval, redaction, and production/copying of the records responsive to the request, and the city has actually incurred such costs but the requester fails to inspect or accept copies of the records, the open records officer shall be authorized to collect such charges in any manner authorized by law. In any instance in which the open records officer has estimated costs in excess of $25.00 for responding to a request, the open records officer may defer the search, retrieval, redaction, and production/copying of the records until the requester has stated, in writing, his or her willingness to pay an amount equal to the estimate of costs. In any instance in which the estimated costs exceed $500.00, the open records officer shall insist, in writing, upon prepayment of the estimated costs prior to beginning search, retrieval, redaction, production or copying of the records. In any instance in which a requester has outstanding costs owing to the city for a previous records request, the open records officer shall insist upon prepayment of the outstanding costs and estimated costs prior to beginning search and retrieval.

                  Requests by civil litigants, or their counsel of record, in any ongoing civil action or administrative proceeding shall be made in writing and shall include the style of the action or proceeding, the names and addresses of all parties and, if a party is represented by counsel, the name, address, and telephone number of the party's attorney; a copy of the request shall be served by the requester upon all parties or their counsel of record in the action or proceeding contemporaneous to filing the written request with the open records officer. The open records officer shall make duplicate set(s) of records provided in response to the request available to all parties or their counsel for the cost of copies only, unless a party or its counsel elects not to receive the records and pay the copying charge. If the city is a party to the action or proceeding, a set of responses shall be provided to counsel for the city at no charge.

                  Sec. 14-131. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Classified dog means any dog that has been classified as either a dangerous dog or a vicious dog pursuant to this article. 
                  Dangerous dog means any dog that: 
                  (1)  Causes a substantial puncture of a person's skin by teeth without causing serious injury; provided, however, that a nip, scratch, or abrasion shall not be sufficient to classify a dog as dangerous under this subparagraph; 
                  (2)  Aggressively attacks in a manner that causes a person to reasonably believe that the dog posed an imminent threat of serious injury to such person or another person although no such injury occurs; provided, however, that the acts of barking, growling, or showing of teeth by a dog shall not be sufficient to classify a dog as dangerous under this subparagraph; or 
                  (3)  While off the owner's property, kills a pet animal; provided however, that this subparagraph shall not apply where the death of such pet animal is caused by a dog that is working or training as a hunting dog, herding dog, or predator control dog. 
                  Owner means any natural person or any legal entity, including, but not limited to, a corporation, partnership, firm, or trust owning, possessing, harboring, keeping, or having custody or control of a dog.

                  Proper enclosure means an enclosure for keeping a dangerous or vicious dog, while on the owner's property, securely confined indoors or in a securely enclosed and locked pen, fence, or structure suitable to prevent the entry of young children and designed to prevent the dog from escaping. Any such pen or structure shall have secure sides and a secure top. If the dog is enclosed within a fence, all sides of the fence shall be of sufficient height and the bottom of the fence shall be constructed or secured in such a manner as to prevent the dog's escape either from over or under the fence. Any such enclosure shall also provide protection from the elements for the dog. 
                  Serious injury means any physical injury that creates a substantial risk of death; results in death, broken or dislocated bones, lacerations requiring multiple sutures, or disfiguring avulsion; requires plastic surgery or admission to a hospital; or results in protracted impairment of health, including transmission of an infection or contagious disease, or impairment of the function of any bodily organ. 
                  Vicious dog means a dog that inflicts serious injury on a person or causes serious injury to a person resulting from reasonable attempts to escape from the dog's attack.

                  No dog shall be classified as a dangerous dog or vicious dog for actions that occur while the dog is used by a law enforcement or military officer to carry out the law enforcement or military officer's official duties.

                  (a)  Upon receiving a report of a dog believed to be subject to classification as a dangerous dog or vicious dog within the county, the animal control officer shall make such investigations as necessary to determine whether such dog is subject to classification as a dangerous dog or a vicious dog. When the animal control officer classifies any dog as a dangerous dog or a vicious dog under this article, the animal control officer shall notify the dog's owner within 72 hours of such classification. The notice to the owner shall meet the following requirements: 
                  (1)  The notice shall be in writing and mailed by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery to the owner's last known address. 
                  (2)  The notice shall include a summary of the animal control officer's determination of the dog's classification as a dangerous or a vicious dog.

                  (6)  The notice shall include a form to request a hearing before the animal control board and shall provide specific instructions on mailing or delivering such a request. 
                  (b)  When the animal control board receives a request for a hearing from an owner, it shall schedule such a hearing within 30 days of receipt of the request, provided that such hearing may be continued by the animal control board for good cause shown. The animal control board shall notify the owner in writing by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery of the date, time, and place of the hearing; such notice shall be made to the owner at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing. At the hearing, the owner shall be given the opportunity to testify and to present evidence. 
                  The animal control board shall also receive such other evidence and hear such other testimony as it may find reasonably necessary to make a determination to sustain, modify, or overrule the classification of the dog by the animal control officer. Within ten days of the date of the hearing, the animal control board shall notify the owner in writing, by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery, of its determination on the matter. If the determination is made that the dog is a dangerous dog or a vicious dog, the notice shall specify the date upon which that determination is effective. If the determination is that the dog is to be euthanized pursuant to subsection (c) below, the notice shall specify the date by which the euthanasia shall occur. Unless the board determines that a later date is appropriate in a particular case, the effective date of the determination shall be the date of the animal control officer's classification. 
                  (c)  A dog that is found, after notice and opportunity for hearing as provided in this section, to have caused serious injury to a human on more than one occasion shall be euthanized; provided, however, that no injury occurring before July 1, 2012, shall count for purposes of this subsection.

                  Editor's note— Section 1 of Ord. No. 2013-0211, adopted Feb. 11, 2013, repealed the former art. III, §§ 22-81—22-97, and enacted a new art. III as set out herein. The former art. III pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 06-0109-02, §§ I—XVII, adopted Jan. 9, 2006. 

                  Sec. 22-81. - Findings. 
                  The unlicensed practice of massage therapy has in certain contexts been associated with criminal behavior that damages the reputations of those who comply with the law as well as the communities in which these businesses operate. As a result, the general assembly has found it necessary to regulate massage therapy and to provide for education and state certification. (Georgia Massage Therapy Practice Act O.C.G.A. § 43-24A-1 et seq.) 
                  Businesses operating massage parlors with massage being offered by unlicensed masseuses and businesses of like character are businesses that affect the public health, safety, and general welfare of the communities in which they operate. Certain of these businesses have been associated with illegal sexual conduct, such as solicitation, pandering, pimping, prostitution, sodomy, lewdness, and other sexual conduct. (LA Times, 2/20/12; Houston Chronicle, 5/13/12; Cleveland Plain Dealer, 6/23/12; Sun Sentinel, 11/24/12). In order to protect the public interest, health, and welfare, it is necessary that such businesses be regulated to prevent their use for unlawful and illegal activities. 
                  The City of Ringgold finds that it is in the best interest of health, welfare, safety, and morals; churches, schools, and parks; and the preservation of its businesses and neighborhoods to prevent the adverse impact of unlicensed massage practitioners and the parlors and businesses of like character wherein they practice illegal sexual activities for compensation. Therefore, the city finds that the prohibition of unlicensed massage practice, as well as the prohibition of dispensation and consumption of alcohol and escort dating services in connection with massage parlors, will improve the public welfare by furthering legitimate government interests, such as reducing criminal activity, protection against devaluation and deterioration of properties located nearby, and eliminating undesirable community conditions normally associated with parlors that have masseuses who are not licensed pursuant to the Georgia Massage Therapy Practice Act, and that such prohibition will not infringe upon the protected constitutional rights of freedom of speech. To that end, this article is hereby adopted. 
                  (Ord. No. 2013-0211, § 1, 2-11-13)

                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 30-1. - Sessions. 
                  A regular session of the municipal court shall be held each month in sufficient frequency to meet the needs of the city. Each session shall be held at a fixed hour of a fixed day as may be determined by the judge, provided any session may be dispensed with when there is no business pending in the court or if no cases are ready for trial. 
                  Sec. 30-2. - Duty of police officers—Persons violating city ordinances. 
                  Any police officer of the city shall arrest and confine in the county jail, when necessary, any offender against ordinances of the city, where such arrest and confinement is necessary to secure such offender's appearance before the municipal court to answer for his offense, or where it is necessary to preserve the peace and good order of the city; or such police officer may take bond as otherwise provided in section 30-46. 
                  Sec. 30-3. - Same—Persons violating certain state laws. 
                  Any person who shall, in the presence of any police officer, violate any penal laws of this state not punishable by city ordinances shall be arrested with or without a warrant and be carried before a committing magistrate for examination and prosecution. 
                  Sec. 30-4. - Docket. 
                  It shall be the duty of the court clerk to keep a docket showing the disposition of all cases brought before the municipal court. At the trial of all cases, the city manager shall record opposite the statement of the case the punishment inflicted and the date; and an entry shall be made under the sentence of the judge of the municipal court showing the final disposition of the case, that is, whether the fine, if any, was collected, the date of such collection and the disposition of such amounts. 
                  Sec. 30-5. - Warrant or summons; issuance. 
                  It shall be the duty of any member of the police department, in all cases where complaint is made or information obtained of any violation of any of the laws or ordinances of the city, to issue an accusation/summons in the name of the city and directed to the accused, requiring him to appear before the municipal court to answer such charge, which accusation/summons shall designate the time and place of trial. It shall be signed by the officer issuing the accusation/summons, and a copy shall be served upon the accused either personally or by leaving the copy at his place of residence by the issuing officer. 
                  Sec. 30-6. - Service of summons generally. 
                  Summons directed to any offender shall be served personally by some member of the police force. 
                  Sec. 30-7. - Procedure for service of process on corporations. 
                  (a)  In addition to any other means provided by law, corporations may be served in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
                  (b)  Whenever any charge shall be preferred against a corporation doing business in the city for violation of this Code or other ordinance of the city, the city manager shall issue an original and copy notice to the defendant corporation of the charge against such corporation, specifying the time when such charge shall be heard by the municipal court of the city, which copy notice shall be served by the chief of police or any police officer of the city, or the sheriff of the county, at least ten days before the time fixed for trial in the municipal court upon any officer of such corporation to be found in the city, or upon any agent of such corporation, or employee in charge of the business of such corporation, in the city. The officer serving such copy notice shall make an entry of such service on the original notice and return the notice to the municipal court of the city. Such service shall be service upon the corporation; and such case shall, upon the return of such notice as provided in this section, stand for trial before the municipal court at the time stated in such notice. 
                  Sec. 30-8. - Issuance of subpoenas. 
                  Whenever the attendance of any witness may be required before the municipal court to establish any fact, the city manager shall issue a subpoena or summons directed to the witness, stating the time and place of trial and the parties to the case, which shall be served as other process by the chief of police, or other officer or police officer. 
                  Sec. 30-9. - Failure of defendant to appear at trial; failure to plead; judge's entry of plea; conviction. 
                  At the time fixed for trial in municipal court, if the defendant corporation fails to appear, or appearing fails to plead, the municipal court judge or other official presiding over the municipal court of the city shall cause to be entered a plea of not guilty, and the trial shall proceed as though the defendant had appeared and pleaded. Upon the conviction of any corporation in any such trial, there shall be rendered a judgment against it for the fine imposed, upon which an execution shall issue, signed by the municipal court judge and city manager in favor of the city against the property of the defendant corporation. 
                  Sec. 30-10. - Contempt for failure of witness to appear. 
                  If any person summoned as a witness shall fail, neglect or refuse to attend the trial, or render an excuse, sufficient in the judgment of the judge of the municipal court, the defaulting witness shall be liable to a fine as provided by section 1-11. If the cause shall be continued on account of the absence of the witness, the court may issue attachment against the witness, requiring him to show cause on the day appointed for trial why he should not be further dealt with for contempt. The chief of police shall, by virtue of the attachment, arrest such witness, or cause him to be arrested by some other officer or police officer, and shall confine him, so as to have him before the court at such time as may be appointed for further hearing of the original complaint. 
                  Sec. 30-11. - Continuances. 
                  Where the ends of justice may require, all cases may be continued. Applications for continuance shall be addressed to the sound discretion of the court, under the rules governing in the superior courts of this state. All motions in the municipal court for a continuance of any case where the defendant is at liberty on bond shall be made by the defendant, his attorney at law or his attorney in fact, which designation shall not include the surety of his appearance bond. No motion to continue a case shall be entertained except in open court and on the day set for trial. Where an appearance bond has been forfeited and the forfeiture is subsequently set aside for cause, no further motion to continue the case for trial shall be entertained until a forfeiture fee as set forth in the schedule of fees and charges has been paid. 
                  Sec. 30-12. - Holding defendant when court lacks jurisdiction. 
                  If after an investigation of any case it should appear that the municipal court has no jurisdiction to determine it, the judge or the mayor shall require the defendant to enter into bond conditioned to appear before the next term of the court having jurisdiction, to answer such offense, which bond shall be turned over to the proper officer of such court. In default of such bond the judge or the mayor shall have power to commit the defendant to jail to answer the offense at the next term of court having jurisdiction thereof. 
                  Sec. 30-13. - Rules of practice. 
                  The city shall have the opening and conclusion in each case unless the defendant introduces no evidence. The defendant shall then be entitled to the conclusion. The city shall announce first if it is ready for trial; and if not, it shall be held to as strict a showing for continuances as the defendant. The rules of evidence and examination of witnesses shall be the same as in the superior courts, so far as such rules are applicable to the case on trial. All officers, informers and persons injured shall be competent witnesses. In general, the municipal court shall be controlled by the rules of practice governing the superior courts, so far as they are applicable to municipal courts, and by a sound construction of the Charter and ordinances of the city. 
                  Sec. 30-14. - Guilty pleas. 
                  Any party charged with the violation of any provision of this Code or any ordinance of the city may file his plea of "guilty" under such rules as the court may direct. Upon a plea of guilty, the court shall pass sentence or judgment in the case as may appear reasonable and proper. 
                  Sec. 30-15. - Minimum costs; working out. 
                  In each case of a conviction in the municipal court, the costs assessable shall be as set forth in the schedule of fees and charges. Costs shall go into the general fund of the city for general municipal purposes. Defendants unable to pay costs, and compelled in lieu of payment to work on the public works, shall be each required to work two days to cover costs. 
                  Sec. 30-16. - Contempt. 
                  Any person who, during a session of the municipal court, shall be guilty of a contempt of court, or who refuses to abide by any sentence or order of the court, shall be punished as provided by section 1-11. 
                  Sec. 30-17. - Administrative fee. 
                  The court may assess an administrative fee in any case not to exceed $1,000.00 per citation, accusation, charge, violation, or motion by the city requesting certain relief. The total for said charges of administrative fee shall be calculated upon a reasonable estimate of costs incurred in the matter before the court. In special circumstances where clear and convincing evidence demonstrates costs in excess of $1,000.00, the court may increase the amount commensurate with the proof submitted. 
                  (Ord. No. 05-0228-03, § 1, 2-28-05) 
                  Sec. 30-18. - Technology surcharge. 
                  There shall be imposed by the municipal court a technology surcharge of $15.00 for each offense for which a violation is found except those offenses set forth in O.C.G.A. §§ 40-8-76 and 40-8-76.1. Said technology surcharge shall be in addition to all other fines, fees and surcharges imposed by the municipal court. All revenue derived from the technology surcharge shall be utilized by the city for technology support for the police department and municipal court.

                  Sec. 30-47. - Persons refusing to give bond.

                  Sec. 30-48. - Designation of bail; procedure upon failure of bonded persons to appear. 
                  Upon failure of any principal in any bond to appear where such principal is charged with a violation of any of the provisions of this Code or other ordinances of the city or upon the failure of any principal who is a witness to appear and testify as engaged, the judge of the municipal court shall pass a rule requiring the principal and sureties on such bond or recognizance to show cause before him on any date named in this rule, not to be less than a period of time as set by the judge of the municipal court from the passage of such rule, why they should not be required to pay the amount of such bond or recognizance and all costs of forfeiture. 
                  Sec. 30-49. - Service of rule to show cause. 
                  Any member of the police force of the city shall serve a copy of the rule described in section 30-48 upon the principal and surety, if to be found in the city, personally or by leaving a copy at their usual place of abode, at least five days before the time named in the rule for hearing the cause.

                  If no sufficient cause is shown to the contrary, the judge of the municipal court shall proceed to enter judgment against the principal and sureties for the amount of such bond and costs; and the city manager shall issue execution for the amount of the judgment and costs, which execution shall bear teste in the name of the judge, and place the same in the hands of the chief of police, who shall proceed to collect the same by levy and sale. 
                  Sec. 30-51. - Delivery of principal prior to judgment and forfeiture; release of surety. 
                  Any surety upon any bail bond of any person charged with a violation of any provision of this Code or other ordinance of the city may surrender his principal at any time before forfeiture to the chief of police, who shall confine such principal until discharged by order of the municipal court, or until such principal shall give other good and acceptable security; and the delivery of the principal by the surety shall discharge such surety from all liability upon the bond.

                  Sec. 30-53. - Disposition of money pledges. 
                  If the person arrested shall fail to appear at the place and time of trial so appointed, it shall be the duty of the judge of the municipal court to declare any pledge forfeited and to order the money to be paid into the city treasury as in other fines and forfeitures if it has not already been deposited in such treasury.

                  Sec. 38-33. - Dangerous structures. 
                  (a)  (1)  It is the duty of the owner of every dwelling, building, structure, or property within the jurisdiction to construct and maintain such dwelling, building, structure, or property in conformance with applicable codes in force within the jurisdiction, or such ordinances which regulate and prohibit activities on property and which declare it to be a public nuisance to construct or maintain any dwelling, building, structure, or property in violation of such codes or ordinances; 
                  (2)  The chief of police and the city manager or their designees are authorized to enforce the provisions of this section. 
                  (3)  That whenever a request is filed with the public officer by a public authority or by at least five residents of the municipality charging that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer shall make an investigation or inspection of the specific dwelling, building, structure, or property. If the officer's investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer may issue a complaint in rem against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building, or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general nuisance exists and shall cause summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the owner and parties in interest in such dwelling, building, or structure. The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; identify the owner and parties in interest; state with particularity the factual basis for the action; and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. The summons shall notify the owner and parties in interest that a hearing will be held before a court of competent jurisdiction as determined by O.C.G.A. § 41-2-5, at a date and time certain and at a place within the municipality where the property is located. Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days nor more than 45 days after the filing of said complaint in the municipal court. The owner and parties in interest shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for hearing; 
                  (4)  That if, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state in writing findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner and any parties in interest that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order; 
                  a.  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  b.  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property. 
                  For purposes of this code section, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. Chapter 39A of Title 43, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction. 
                  (5)  That, if the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved or to be vacated and closed or demolished. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful."; 
                  (6)  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and governing authority are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials; and 
                  (7)  That the amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
                  (b)  (1)  The lien provided for in subsection (a)(7) of this code section shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court in the county where the real property is located and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12(g). The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the county tax commissioner. It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. Chapter 4 of Title 48; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the municipality. Thirty days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. 
                  (2)  Where the remittance is to a municipality, the tax commissioner shall collect and retain an amount equal to the cost of administering a lien authorized by this chapter unless such costs are waived by resolution of the county governing authority. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of administering the lien. 
                  (c)  The governing authority may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
                  (d)  Where the abatement action does not commence in the superior court, review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29. 
                  (e)  In addition to the procedures and remedies in this chapter, a governing authority may provide by ordinance that designated public officers may issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted by ordinance, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and seek to enforce such citations in a court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this code section. 
                  (f)  Nothing in this code section shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the municipality to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise. 
                  (g)  The public officer may determine, under existing ordinances, that a dwelling, building, or structure is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use if he finds that conditions exist in such building, dwelling, or structure which are dangerous or injurious to the health, safety, or morals of the occupants of such dwelling, building, or structure; of the occupants of neighborhood dwellings, buildings, or structures; or of other residents of such municipality. Such conditions may include the following (without limiting the generality of the foregoing): 
                  (1)  Defects therein increasing the hazards of fire, accidents, or other calamities; 
                  (2)  Lack of adequate ventilation, light, or sanitary facilities; 
                  (3)  Dilapidation; 
                  (4)  Disrepair; 
                  (5)  Structural defects; and 
                  (6)  Uncleanliness. 
                  Such ordinance may provide additional standards to guide the public officer, or his agents, in determining the fitness of a dwelling, building, or structure for human habitation or for its current commercial, industrial, or business use. 
                  (h)  An ordinance adopted by the governing body of the municipality may authorize the public officer to exercise such powers as may be necessary or convenient to carry out and effectuate the purpose and provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-7 through 41-2-10, 41-2-12 through 41-2-17, including the following powers in addition to others granted in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-7 through 41-2-10 and §§ 41-2-12 through 41-2-17: 
                  (1)  To investigate the dwelling conditions in the unincorporated area of the county or in the municipality in order to determine which dwellings, buildings, or structures therein are unfit for human habitation or are unfit for current commercial, industrial, or business use or are vacant, dilapidated, and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; 
                  (2)  To administer oaths and affirmations, to examine witnesses, and to receive evidence; 
                  (3)  To enter upon premises for the purpose of making examinations; provided, however, that such entries shall be made in such manner as to cause the least possible inconvenience to the persons in possession; 
                  (4)  To appoint and fix the duties of such officers, agents, and employees as he deems necessary to carry out the purposes of the ordinances; and 
                  (5)  To delegate any of his functions and powers under the ordinance to such officers and agents as he may designate.

In order to maintain the numeric style of the Code, said provisions have been redesignated as §§ 38-118—38-126. Original numbering has been maintained in the history notes following each section. 

                  Sec. 38-118. - Definitions. 
                  As used in this article, the following words, terms, and phrases shall have the meaning ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Litter means all discarded sand, gravel, slag, brickbats, rubbish, waste material, tin cans, refuse, garbage, trash, debris, dead animals, or other discarded materials of every kind including consumed and unconsumed substances.

It shall be unlawful for any person to dump, deposit, throw or leave or cause or permit the dumping, depositing, placing, throwing or leaving of litter on any road or street or any public or private property in the city, unless the litter is placed into a litter receptacle, container or dumpster installed on such property and designated for the disposal of litter. 
                  (b)  Public streets and private property. No person shall place any accumulations of litter or household trash in any street, median strip, alley or other public place of travel, nor upon any private property. 
                  (c)  Blockage of drainage. No person shall place any refuse, trash, refuse receptacles or containers on, over or near any storm drain or drainage ditch, or so close thereto as to cause such material to interfere in any way with such drainage. 
                  (d)  Unauthorized storage. Any accumulation of litter or rubbish items on any lot, property, premises, public street, alley or other public or private place is hereby declared to be a nuisance. Failure of the owner or occupant to remove and correct any such accumulation of refuse after appropriate notice from the police department or code enforcement officer or its designee shall raise the presumption that such person intended to violate this division. 
                  (e)  Appliances. It shall be unlawful for any person to leave outside any building in a place accessible to children any appliance, refrigerator or other container which has an airtight snap lock, magnetic or similar device without first removing therefrom the lock or door.

                  (g)  Used tires. No person shall accumulate used vehicle tires in such a manner as to pose a danger to the public health, safety and welfare. 
                  (h)  Waterways and stormwater drainage systems. 
                  (1)  It shall be unlawful for any person or persons to throw, dump, sweep, push, blow, deposit, or leave or to cause or to permit the throwing, dumping, sweeping, pushing, blowing, depositing, or leaving of litter in any public or private gutter, street, right-of-way, waterway, or stormwater collection system within the city; and 
                  (2)  It shall be unlawful for any person or persons to dump raw human waste or wastewater of any sort, used motor oil, and any other contaminated liquid into any public right-of-way, waterway, or stormwater collection system within the city. This includes dumping from any train, aircraft, motor vehicle, or vessel unless otherwise authorized by law. 
                  (i)  Failure to remove. Upon the failure, neglect, or refusal of any owner, or occupant so notified to remove litter as defined herein within the period designated, the police department and/or code enforcement officer and/or its designee is authorized and empowered to arrange for the removal of the same by the city or by a private firm through contract with the city. 
                  (j)  Cost of removal. The actual cost of such removal shall be assessed against the property owner from whose premises the litter is removed, and, in the event the bill for such charges remains unpaid for 30 days after it has been rendered, the same shall become a lien upon the premises enforceable in the same manner as provided for the collection of unpaid taxes.

                  (b)  Every owner and every operator of a private or commercial parking lot shall provide litter containers of adequate size, character, and number as specified by the commissioner or his designee to contain the litter generated by the operations of that parking lot.

                  DIVISION 2. - SOUND LEVELS AND SOUND MEASUREMENT 

                  Sec. 38-142. - Allowable sound levels. 
                  (a)  The maximum permissible sound level as measured at the property line or anywhere within the receiving property shall be as set forth in the following table: 
                  Maximum Permissible Sound Level 

                   
                  (Ord. No. 2013-0225-02, § 1, 8-26-13) 
                  Sec. 38-143. - Sound measuring procedure. 
                  (a)  Insofar as practicable, sound will be measured while the source under investigation is operating at normal, routine conditions and, as necessary, at other conditions, including but not limited to, design, maximum, and fluctuating rates. All noise measurements shall be made as directed in this article. When instrumentation cannot be placed at or within the property line, the measurement shall be made as close thereto as is reasonable. For the purposes of this article, noise measurements are measured on the A- or C-weighting scale, as applicable, of a sound level meter (SLM) of standard design and quality having characteristics established by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). 
                  (b)  All tests shall be conducted in accordance with the following procedures: 
                  (1)  The code enforcement officer shall, to the extent practicable, identify all sources contributing sound to the point of measurement but shall not be required to document the absence of such sources or document that such sources would not have caused the test to be valid. 
                  (2)  Measurements for comparison of the ambient sound level of a sound source to the background noise level shall be taken at the nearest receiving property line. When a measurement is being taken to determine whether the noise source is in violation of the maximum permissible sound level, the measurement shall also be taken at the nearest receiving property line. Where a violation is perceived by the code enforcement officer to be occurring absent a report of noise disturbance from nearby properties, or the nearest receiving property line is not readily apparent or accessible, the code enforcement officer may take such measurements from the public right-of-way adjacent to the property from which the noise source originates. 
                  (3)  The SLM must be calibrated using a calibrator or method recommended by the SLM manufacturer and in the manner recommended. Automatic internal calibration of the SLM which occurs as a part of the initialization of the SLM shall be sufficient to satisfy this requirement. 
                  (4)  The SLM shall be placed at a minimum height of three feet above the ground or from any reflective surface. When handheld, the microphone shall be held at arm's length and pointed at the source at the angle recommended by the SLM manufacturer. 
                  (5)  If extraneous sound sources, such as aircraft flyovers or barking dogs that are unrelated to the measurements increase the monitored sound levels, the measurements should be postponed until these extraneous sounds have become of such a level as not to increase the monitored sound levels of interest. 
                  (6)  The monitoring session should last for a period of time sufficient to ensure that the sound levels measured are typical of the source in question, but in no event shall the duration of testing be less than one minute. 
                  (c)  At the discretion of a police officer or code enforcement officer and as an alternative to making a determination based upon the ambient sound level or absolute sound level, the following standards shall be used for sounds emanating from any noise source located on any residential property, commercial property, or public property: 
                  (1)  During daytime hours, sound emanating from any noise source shall be limited in volume, tone and intensity so that the sound shall not be plainly audible to any person at a distance of 200 or more feet from the real property line of any private property on which the noise source is located, or from any noise source located on any public property or public right-of-way; provided however that under no circumstance shall the existence of this standard prevent a violation from being found if the sound is measured as set forth in this article. A violation of this subsection may also be established by observations made in the public right-of-way at the distance specified from the real property line of any private property or any public property on which the noise source is located. 
                  (2)  During nighttime hours, sound emanating from any noise source shall be limited in volume, tone and intensity so that the sound shall not be plainly audible to any person at a distance of 50 or more feet from the real property line of any private property on which the noise source is located, or from any noise source located on any public property or public right-of-way; provided however that under no circumstance shall the existence of this standard prevent a violation from being found if the sound is measured as set forth in this article. A violation of this subsection may also be established by observations made in the public right-of-way at the distance specified from the real property line of any private property or any public property on which the noise source is located. 
                  (3)  The determination of the location of the real property line of any private property on which the noise source is located or the determination of the location of the public right-of-way line shall not be required to be made pursuant to the review of a survey or other document. In making the determination, any police officer or any code enforcement officer may use the appearance of the parcel where the noise source originates and the arrangement of the structures thereon as well as similar characteristics on surrounding parcels to make a determination as to the approximate location of the property line or may use the apparent limits of the public right-of-way adjacent to the parcel where the noise source originates. 
                  (4)  The determination of the number of feet from the real property line of any private property on which the noise source is located, or from any noise source located on any public property or public right-of-way shall not require a measurement to be taken using electronic or mechanical means and it shall be sufficient if the code enforcement officer or the police officer is able to make a good faith determination that the minimum distance has been exceeded when the plainly audible determination is made. 
                  (5)  In determining whether or not a sound emanating from a noise source violates this section, the code enforcement officer or police officer may consider the following factors: 
                  a.  Level of the noise based upon reaction to it in the same manner as it would be experienced by a reasonable person; 
                  b.  Nature of the noise on which the complaint is based; 
                  c.  Origin of the noise based on required distance; 
                  d.  Level and intensity of any background noise compared to the noise being investigated; 
                  e.  Proximity of the noise to sleeping facilities; 
                  f.  Nature and zoning of the area; 
                  g.  Density of inhabitation in the area; 
                  h.  Time of day or night the noise is occurring; 
                  i.  Duration of the noise; 
                  j.  Whether the noise is recurrent, intermittent, or constant, especially in cases where voluntary compliance is followed by a second complaint within any 24-hour period; 
                  k.  Whether voluntary compliance is obtained. 
                  (6)  After having made a determination under this section that a noise violates this section, a police officer or code enforcement officer may issue a citation for violation of this section but shall not be required to do so upon their determination that the level of plainly audible noise is not such as would disturb a reasonable person or is no greater than the level and intensity of any background noise compared to the noise being investigated.

As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs.

                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 38-173(b)(2) of this article; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraphs (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of article 5, chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (17)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with chapter 5 of title 12, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970," and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade stormwater detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 2018-0108-01, § 1, 1-8-18) 
                  Sec. 38-174. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of City of Ringgold without first obtaining a permit from the city manager to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the city manager and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this article. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 38-173(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by five copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 38-173(c)(15), (16) and (17) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 38-173(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 38-173(c)(15), (16) and (17) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f) (1).

                  Sec. 38-175. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The City of Ringgold will periodically inspect the sites of land disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)  The City of Ringgold shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  (a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land disturbing activity. If any person commences any land disturbing activity requiring a land disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  (b)  Stop work orders. 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop work order requiring that land disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop work order; and; 
                  (3)  All stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  (4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person.

                  (1)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation; and, if applicable, to secure by closing the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  (2)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property. 
                  For purposes of this section, the court shall make its determination of reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered; and, provided further, that if the unsatisfactory condition is limited solely to the presence of graffiti, the dwelling, building or structure shall not be ordered demolished or closed, but its owner may be ordered to repair the same by cleaning or removal of the graffiti. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. tit. 43, ch. 39A, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction. 
                  (d)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the public officer shall cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved, or to be vacated and closed, or demolished within 270 days of the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to subsection of this section or any equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action shall commence. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (e)  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and the mayor and council are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
                  (f)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
                  (g)  The lien provided for in subsection (f) shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court in Catoosa County and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under subsection 38-227(a)(4). The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall, within 90 days of the completion of repairs, demolition or closure, forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the county tax commissioner. 
                  (h)  It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. § 48-4-5; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply; provided, further, that redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. The tax commissioner may initiate enforcement of liens imposed under this section at any time following receipt of the final determination of costs from the public officer. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. 
                  (i)  The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the city. The tax commissioner may retain an amount equal to the cost of administering collection of the lien. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of administering the lien. 
                  (j)  The governing authority may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the city agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
                  (k)  Review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29.

                  (2)  At least 14 days prior to the date of the hearing, the public officer shall mail copies of the complaint and summons by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery, return receipt requested, to all interested parties whose identities and addresses are readily ascertainable. Copies of the complaint and summons shall also be mailed by first-class mail to the property address to the attention of the occupants, if any; 
                  (3)  For interested parties whose mailing address is unknown, a notice stating the date, time, and place of the hearing shall be published in the newspaper in which the sheriffs advertisements appear in such county once a week for two consecutive weeks prior to the hearing; and 
                  (4)  A notice of lis pendens shall be filed in the office of the clerk of superior court in which the dwelling, building, structure, or property is located at the time of filing the complaint in municipal court. 
                  (b)  The public officer shall cause an affidavit of service to be filed of record in the municipal court prior to the hearing showing compliance with the service requirements of this section. Such affidavit shall constitute a prima facie showing of minimum procedural due process and shall constitute sufficient proof that service was perfected. 
                  (c)  Orders and other filings made subsequent to service of the initial complaint shall be served in the manner provided in this section on every interested party who answers the complaint or appears at the hearing. Any interested party who fails to answer or appear at the hearing shall be deemed to have waived all further notice in the proceedings.

                  It is the intent of this article to protect the public health, life safety and general welfare of properties and occupiers of buildings and structures within the city in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person or to any specified property within or without the boundaries of the city. Approval of a permit and inspection of a property shall in no manner guarantee or warrant to the owner or occupants thereof that said property has been constructed, maintained, or operated in conformance with applicable codes, laws and regulations. The city reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the city, its officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship as may now exist or hereafter be created. To the extent any federal or state law, regulation, or ordinance requires compliance as a condition precedent to the issuance of a permit, plan or design approval, inspection or other activity by the city, its officers, employees and agents, issuance of such permit, approval, or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver or estoppel of the condition precedent, and it shall remain the obligation and responsibility of the owner, his design professional(s), and contractor(s) to satisfy such legal requirements.

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. Accessory structures are not exempt from requirements of this chapter. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, or a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration or improvements to a building, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of the building should be the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or, in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. Substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not however include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary or safety code specifications that are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions that have been pre-identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or increase flood heights, velocities or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development that may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers that are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

Specifically, the following information is required: 
                  (1)  Application stage. In the application stage: 
                  a.  Elevation in relation to mean sea level (or highest adjacent grade) of the lowest floor, including basement, of all proposed structures; 
                  b.  Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any nonresidential structure will be flood-proofed; 
                  c.  Design certification from a registered professional engineer or architect that any proposed nonresidential flood-proofed structure will meet the flood-proofing criteria of subsection 48-82(2); and 
                  d.  Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of a proposed development. 
                  (2)  Construction stage. In the construction stage of all new construction and substantial improvements, the permit holder shall provide to the administrator an as-built certification of the regulatory floor elevation or flood-proofing level immediately after the lowest floor or flood-proofing is completed. Any lowest floor certification made relative to mean sea level shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by the surveyor or engineer. When flood-proofing is utilized for nonresidential structures, the certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by the engineer or architect. Any work undertaken prior to submission of these certifications shall be at the permit holder's risk. The building inspector shall review the above-referenced certification data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further progressive work being allowed to proceed. Failure to submit certification or failure to make the required corrections shall be cause to issue a stop work order for the project.

                  Sec. 42-82. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than two and seven-tenths feet above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 42-81(4). 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above two and seven-tenths feet above base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any structure located in A1—30, AE or AH zones may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to two feet above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this subsection and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 42-48(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on individual lots or parcels, in new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than two and seven-tenths feet above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than two and seven-tenths feet above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (See subsection 42-81(6).) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick-disconnect-type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  2.  Meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (3)c of this section; 
                  3.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 42-7 are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification. 
                  b.  Only if subsection (4)a. is satisfied, any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article. 
                  c.  The placement of manufactured homes, except in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, shall be prohibited. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of subsection 42-81(6) are met, and the elevation standards of subsection 42-82(1) and the encroachments standards of subsection (4)a. of this section are met. 
                  d.  Removal of trees and other vegetation may not be a consideration in calculating the effect of proposed encroachment on flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (5)  Floodway fringe, lower. Within the lower floodway fringe is the area between the floodway and the upper floodway fringe that is lower than one-half the distance between the floodway and the boundary of the area of special flood hazard. The lower floodway fringe is a transitional area that is hazardous due to its proximity to the floodway and encroachment by fill or development within this area could have serious impact on the entire floodplain. The following provisions shall apply with the lower floodway fringe: 
                  a.  Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments shall be prohibited unless certification by a registered professional engineer, with supporting technical data, is provided to the director demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of base flood discharge; 
                  b.  If subsection 42-81(4)a. is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of section 42-81. 
                  c.  The placement of manufactured homes, except in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, shall be prohibited. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of subsection 42-81(6), and the elevation standard of subsection 42-81(1), and the encroachment standards of subsection 42-82(4)a. are met. 
                  d.  Removal of trees and other vegetation may not be a consideration in effects of proposed encroachment on flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (6)  Large tracts. If a tract contains over one acre located within the area of special flood hazard, then development or land disturbance on that portion of the tract located within the special flood hazard area shall comply with the standards for lower floodway fringe set forth in subsection 42-82(5). 
                  (7)  Other area unsuitable for development. Land subject to flooding that is not located within a mapped area of special flood hazard may, at the discretion of the director of floodplain management, be required to comply with any or all standards set forth in this chapter. 
                  (8)  Grading in the area of the special flood hazard. Grading (including excavating, filing, or any culmination thereof) shall be prohibited in the area of the special flood hazard except for the following: 
                  a.  Minimum land-disturbing activities such as home gardens and individual home landscaping, repairs, maintenance work and other related activities. 
                  b.  Agricultural practices involving the establishment, cultivation or harvesting or products of the field or orchard, preparing and planting of pasture land, forestry land management practices including harvesting (where stumps are not removed), farm ponds, dairy operations, livestock and poultry management practices and the construction of farm buildings; 
                  c.  Projects permitted by or carried out under the technical supervision of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or any other agency of the U.S. Government; 
                  d.  Cemetery graves; 
                  e.  Excavation for wells or tunnels or utilities; 
                  f.  Approved mining, quarrying, stockpiling of rock, sand, gravel aggregates or clay where established and provided by law; 
                  g.  Exploratory excavations under the direction of soil engineering geologist; 
                  h.  Where consistent with other provisions of this chapter, minimum grading for land development or construction which does not result in topographic changes greater than two feet at any location and which is not for the sole purpose of elevating structures pursuant to subsection 42-81(1) and subsection 42-82(2) of this chapter. In no case, shall fill be transported into the area of special flood hazard; 
                  i.  Construction activities at existing industrial sites which were developed before the effective date of the FIRST Floodplain Management Ordinance adopted by Catoosa County, GA as a basis for Catoosa County's participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), such as dikes, ditches and ponds. 
                  (9)  As-built drawings and certification. Within the area of the special flood hazard, as-built drawings and certifications shall be provided by a registered professional engineer and/or a registered land surveyor pursuant to subsection 42-47(2) and subsection 42-82(2) of this chapter, and also when required by the site plan regulations or the subdivision regulations. As-built drawings and other certifications may be required in other situations at the discretion of the director of floodplain management.

                  Editor's note— Section 1 of Ord. No. 2015-0126, adopted Jan. 26, 2015, repealed former ch. 43, and enacted new provisions to read as herein set out. Former ch. 43, §§ 43-1—43-10 pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 2007-0123, § I, adopted Jan. 23, 2007. 

                  ARTICLE I. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

                  Sec. 43-1. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This chapter seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives:

                  (d)  If the private organization is other than individuals, a permit will not issue without making of the necessary deposit. Individuals may be excused from such deposit by the execution by the individual applicant, or by each individual in a group applying for the permit, of a pauper's affidavit.

                  (1)  For the operation and maintenance of the sewerage system and incidental expenses connected with the system; 
                  (2)  To pay debt requirements on revenue bonds issued to provide funds for the construction, improvement, repair and extension of the sewerage and water purification systems, facilities and appurtenances used in connection with the operation of the system; 
                  (3)  To acquire necessary easements or the purchase of land; and 
                  (4)  To provide funds for the necessary reserves for debt and improvements. 
                  (c)  Determination of amounts. For the purpose provided in subsection (b) of this section, there is charged and assessed to each premises or facility served by connection with the sewerage system of the city, or otherwise discharging sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids, either directly or indirectly into the sewerage system, a sewer service charge, which shall be assessed at the established rate. 
                  (1)  The sewer service charge shall be based upon the quantity of water used by the premises or facility as measured by a water meter in use, or as otherwise established. 
                  (2)  Water used from private sources shall be metered as required in subsection (d) of this section and will be figured at prevailing city water rates, and the sewer service charges shall be billed accordingly. 
                  (d)  Independent water supply, installation of meter. If a lot, parcel of land, premises or facility discharging sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids, either directly or indirectly, into the city's sewerage system, or which ultimately enters the sewerage system, is supplied either in whole or in part with water from wells, or any other source other than the city waterworks, such wells or other source of supply shall be registered with the city waterworks; and if the water is not metered, the owner or occupant shall, at his own cost, install and maintain a meter in such a location and in such a manner as is satisfactory to the city waterworks. These meters shall serve as a control for the establishment of the sewer service charge and shall be read monthly or bimonthly by members of the city waterworks. 
                  (e)  Additional meters. Where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the superintendent that a significant portion of the water as measured by the water meter does not enter the sewerage system, the superintendent may require or permit the installation of additional meters or other devices as may be deemed necessary to establish that portion that does enter the sewerage system; and the corrected meter flow will be used for billing of the sewer service charge. All such additional facilities will be provided by the owner at the premises concerned or other interested parties at no expense to the city.

                  DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

                  Sec. 70-58. - Statement of findings. 
                  It is hereby determined that: 
                  (1)  Discharges to the storm sewer system of the city that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
                  (2)  These nonstormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the storm sewer system of the city from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments; 
                  (3)  These nonstormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically disbursed, small volume nonstormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters; 
                  (4)  The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
                  (5)  These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the storm sewer system of the city; 
                  (6)  Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper nonstormwater discharges to the storm sewer system of the city; 
                  (7)  Therefore, the city must adopt this article to prohibit such nonstormwater discharges to the storm sewer system of the city. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the storm sewer system of the city is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.

                  a.  A letter requesting review and approval of a preliminary plat and giving the name and address of a person to whom the notice of the hearing by the planning commission on the preliminary plat shall be sent.

Preliminary plat approval shall expire and be null and void after a period of one year unless an extension of time is requested by the subdivider or his representatives and is approved by the planning commission. 
                  If action on a preliminary plat is not taken by the planning commission within 62 days of the date of submittal, the preliminary plat shall be considered approved and a certificate of approval shall be issued on demand. However, the applicant for approval may waive this requirement and consent to an extension of time.

                  Sec. 4.1. - Scope of regulations. 
                  No building shall be moved, erected, reconstructed or structurally altered, nor shall any building or land be used which does not comply with all the district regulations specified by this chapter for the district in which the building or land is located. All ordinances, including but not limited to, water and sanitary sewer systems, public sewer service, street regulations must be observed as a condition to the uses provided for in this ordinance.

                  Sec. 4.2. - Lot regulations. 
                  (a)  Substandard lots. Any residentially zoned lot which was of record at the time of the adoption of this ordinance that does not meet the requirements of this ordinance for yards or other area or open space, may be utilized for single residence purposes, provided: 
                  (1)  The area for such yard or court in width, depth, or open space is not less than 75 percent of that required by the terms of this ordinance, excepting that vacant lots having in the aggregate a continuous frontage of 120 feet or more shall not be subject to this exception; 
                  (2)  In the absence of an approved community water supply and/or wastewater treatment system, said lot can meet the requirements of the county health department for the installation of wells and/or septic tanks. The purpose is to permit utilization of recorded lots which lack adequate width or depth as long as reasonable health and living standards can be provided. 
                  (b)  Lot may not be reduced in size below minimum requirements. No parcel of land, even though it may consist of one or more adjacent lots of record, shall be reduced in size so that lot width or depth, front, side, or rear yard, inner or outer courts, lot area per unit, or other requirements of this resolution are not maintained. This section shall not apply when a portion of a lot is acquired for public use. 
                  (c)  Lot size. All lots shall conform to the area requirements set forth in the zoning districts in which they are located. Residential corner lots shall have adequate width to permit appropriate building setbacks from and orientation to both abutting streets. 
                  (d)  Building lines. A building line (setback line), meeting the front, rear and side yard setback requirements of the zoning district in which the parcel of land is located, shall be established on all lots. 
                  (e)  Double frontage lots. Double frontage lots should be avoided, except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. When allowed subject to the standards of this ordinance, a strip of land at least ten feet in width, and across which there shall be no right of access, shall be provided along the lot or line of lots abutting such traffic artery. 
                  (f)  Corner lots. On lots having frontages on two streets, the required front yard setback shall be observed on both streets, but the rear setback corresponding to each front is not necessarily required. A setback compatible with the setback along the line of the adjoining property may be used. This section applies to all zones. 
                  (g)  Lot frontage on a public or private street. No building or structure shall be erected on a lot or portion of a lot which does not have a minimum frontage of 30 feet on a public or private street, or has adequate easements for access to a public/private street. 
                  (h)  Driveways. All driveways constructed after the adoption of this ordinance, shall be required to obtain a driveway permit. Every effort must be taken to ensure that driveways be constructed in a way that will prevent stormwater runoff from entering the street. This may be accomplished by providing a negative slope adequate to prevent stormwater runoff or by the installation of a driveway grate system. The driveway permit application must be accompanied with sufficient information such as drawings and/or plans to demonstrate to the city that every effort has been made. In the event meeting this requirement is not obtainable, the request for a variance will be required.

                  (b)  Due to access, weight-load limitations, and public safety issues, tractor-trailer combinations (also known as 18-wheelers), individual tractors, or individual trailers shall not be parked or stored in residentially zoned districts (see section 6.10). 
                  (c)  Kennels. No grandfathering of rights shall apply to any kennel when the same creates a nuisance.

On double fronting lots, an open or enclosed swimming pool, located behind the dwelling, shall meet the front setback requirement for the district where the lot is located. 
                  (6)  In the A-1 zone district, accessory building and structures which are not intended for use or used for the housing of livestock or poultry and are ancillary to the residential use shall maintain the same front and side yard requirements as the principal structure, however, they shall not project beyond the established building line. The rear yard setback shall be a minimum of ten feet. 
                  (b)  Temporary buildings. Temporary buildings may be used only in conjunction with construction work in any zone district and shall be removed immediately upon the completion of construction. A certificate of zoning compliance must be obtained for use of a temporary building.

                  (p)  Extended stay facility. Extended stay facilities are unique in creating a commercial facility environment, like a motel or hotel, where overnight accommodation is provided for community visitors, yet such facilities also provide overnight accommodation to others, who may be working temporary or full-time jobs in the community or choosing such facility for residence as if it were considered a multi-family dwelling. The latter scenarios are thus residential in nature, with some units within the facility functioning and equipped as dwelling units. The following criteria thus apply:

                  (4)  No permanent business license shall be issued for the conduct of any business from any guest room, nor shall any home occupation function from such guest room. 
                  (5)  Extended stay hotels/motels shall have a landscape plan submitted and approved by the city code enforcement officer, such plan shall be implemented prior to the issuance of a business license. 
                  (6)  Each guest room shall be protected with a sprinkler system approved by the fire marshal or their designee and hard-wired smoke detector shall be provided and installed in each guest unit. 
                  (7)  All guest rooms which have facilities for both the storage and preparation of food shall not have less than 300 square feet of floor area and are limited to a maximum of two persons per such room; however, for all such guest rooms greater than 300 square feet, one additional person shall be allowable per each additional 75 square feet of floor area up to and including a maximum of four persons. 
                  (8)  An indoor or fenced outdoor active recreation area shall be provided. The size of each recreation area shall be calculated at a ratio of five square feet per room with a minimum provision of 600 square feet. 
                  (9)  A minimum of 25 percent of the lot area shall be dedicated to either active or passive open space. The open space shall include active recreation, such as a children's playground area, and/or passive recreation, such as green space and walking paths. 
                  (10)  All such extended stay facilities shall provide a 50-foot undisturbed buffer from any property zoned for multi-family residential or for single family residential purposes. 
                  (q)  Group homes. Groups homes are permitted in the designated residential districts provided that: 
                  (1)  The home is approved and licensed by the State of Georgia Department of Human Resources or any agency through which it acts. 
                  (2)  The outward appearance of a group home shall have the same or similar appearance as that of the dwellings with the same residential district and shall meet the minimum square footage requirement of the district. 
                  (r)  Motor vehicle repair, body shop, and specialty. In the C-2 zone district, all storage of wrecked, disabled, and nonoperational motor vehicles awaiting repair shall be located in the rear yard only, which shall be enclosed by a sight impermeable fence at least six feet high. No parts or waste materials shall be stored outside the enclosed building. 
                  (s)  In the C-1, C-2, and C-3 district, retail sales, displays of merchandise, and storage must be within a completely enclosed building, except for city-sponsored special events, fairs, or parades, where increased pedestrian traffic is intended to enhance the downtown experience. 
                  (t)  Construction of future buildings or new facades in the O-1, C-1 C-2 and C-3 district shall be of brick, three-fourths-inch stucco, fiber cement siding, or EIFS (exterior insulation and finishing system). In the event EIFS is used O-1, C-1 and C-3 a 36-inch-high bulkhead wainscot veneer from the ground up must be constructed of brick, cast stone, manufactured stone, natural stone or custom CMU. Additionally, LP SmartSide siding and Concealed Fastening Metal Wall Systems are permitted in the C-2 zoning district. 
                  (u)  When a new commercial use seeks to occupy a vacant existing building in the C-2 district that has been unoccupied for six months or more and the building does not comply with the façade provisions of section 9-4(u), then the provisions of section 9-4(u) shall apply to such buildings before an occupancy permit is issued for a new use.

                  If rezoning a tract is required to accommodate the proposed development, plans required under this section shall be submitted with the rezoning application. Enactment of the zone district change by the mayor and council shall enable the zoning administrator to process the application accordingly. 
                  If the planned development involves the subdivision of a tract or tracts of land within the proposed development, the approval of the site plan and final subdivision plat shall be recommended by the planning commission for said tract or tracts before approval of the development application for said tract or tracts is granted by the mayor and council. 
                  Duration of approval: If initial development and/or building permits are not obtained within a period of one year after approval of a site plan, said site plan approval shall lapse.

                  --- (1) --- 
                  Editor's note— Printed herein is the city's sign ordinance, as adopted by the city council on October 28, 2013, and effective on the same date. Amendments to the ordinance are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original ordinance. Obvious misspellings and punctuation errors have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, headings and catchlines have been made uniform and the same system of capitalization, citation to state statutes, and expression of numbers in text as appears in the Code of Ordinances has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. 

                  ARTICLE I. - PURPOSE AND SCOPE 

                  [1.1. - Purpose and scope.] 
                  The purpose of this ordinance is to provide standards to safeguard public health, property, and welfare by regulating the location, size, illumination, construction, erection, maintenance, and quality of materials of all exterior signs, and to ensure that signs will not confuse, mislead, or obstruct the vision necessary for traffic and pedestrian safety. 
                  The City of Ringgold ("city") acknowledges, too, that preservation of the health, safety and welfare of the citizenry of the city requires the preservation and protection of the visual attractiveness and aesthetic characteristics of existing streets and neighborhoods throughout the community. Signage controls are included in this ordinance to further the aesthetic values of the community by: 1) protecting neighborhood property values, 2) maintaining the traditional character of historic neighborhoods and districts; 3) avoiding the visual degradation of the city's irreplaceable scenic and environmental resources, and 4) promoting city's continued economic growth by encouraging high quality commercial development. 
                  Reasonable, orderly, and effective display of signs provides vital support for economic development and helps create a positive community image that will attract desirable business and industry to the Ringgold area. The uncontrolled use of signs with their variable sizes, heights, and illumination demand attention to help avoid potential dangers to moving traffic and pedestrians. In addition, uncontrolled sign placements can be destructive to adjacent property values so that clutter replaces the intrinsic values of the property and diminishes the effectiveness of the signs as they compete with each other. Absent regulations, competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their signs undermines the sign owner's original purpose of presenting a clear message to the public. 
                  For these reasons, it has become necessary in the public interest to regulate the sizes, heights, locations, types, and other pertinent physical features of exterior signs in the city while simultaneously acknowledging free speech as a first amendment constitutional right. Balancing the rights of individuals to convey their messages through signs, while protecting the right of the public against unrestricted proliferation of signs is acknowledged as the goal of the city. Such reasonable regulations also further the policy implementation of the city's adopted comprehensive plan, especially regarding impacts on quality land use development in the area.

                  3.1-2 The requirements of this ordinance shall apply to all signs that are visible from a street, public right-of-way, or property in public ownership, regardless of zoning district. 
                  3.2. - Measuring signs. 
                  3.2-1  Display area. See definition for display area in article II of this ordinance. The display area is measured geometrically in square feet, and is the area within the smallest regular geometric shape that contains the entire sign copy. The maximum allowed sign size of this ordinance requires the summation of multiple display areas mounted on any sign structure that are readable from a single direction. 
                  3.2-2  Height of signs. Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, unless the sign is within a 2,500-foot radius of the center point of an interstate exchange the height of a sign at its highest point above ground level may be no greater than 40 feet above the adjacent ground. Inside the 2,500-foot radius the height of a freestanding pole sign at its highest above ground level may be no greater than 70 feet above the adjacent ground. The following rules shall apply in determining adjacent ground: If the base of the sign structure is below the grade of the adjacent roadway, the sign height is measured from the elevation of the adjacent roadway that is nearest to the sign structure. The ground shall not be altered for the sole purpose of providing additional sign height. 
                  3.2-3  Setback. For the purposes of this ordinance, the setback requirements reference the minimum distance from a street right-of-way line required for the placement of a sign structure. For side or rear line setbacks in all zone districts, a sign structure shall comply with a minimum setback of 12 feet from the property line, but in no case shall the sign structure be placed on or the sign display area extend across any property line, required buffer, or over a public right-of-way, except as may be allowed in the C-3 zone district.

                  3.4-3 Signs may be mounted back to back when they share the same structure and only one side (the larger side if of unequal dimensions) shall be considered in computing the display area dimensions. 
                  3.5. - Corner visibility clearance. 
                  In any district, no sign or sign structure (above a height of four feet) shall be maintained within 15 feet of the intersection of the right-of-way lines of two streets, or of a street intersection with a railroad right-of-way. However, a sign structure (example: pole support) not more than ten inches in diameter, if located on a corner lot where services are provided to the motoring public, may be located within the required corner visibility area if all other requirements of this article are met and the lowest elevation of the sign surface is at least eight feet six inches above the ground level.

They may project from the building wall no more than four feet to the outside edge of the sign. Projecting signs are not permitted at the intersection of corners except at right angles to the building front, unless otherwise authorized by this ordinance. 
                  (a)  The maximum size of a projecting sign is 40 square feet in commercial and industrial zone districts where such signs are allowed. In the C-3 zone district, projecting signs may overhang the R/W as long as a clear height of eight feet six inches is maintained above the ground, a sidewalk, or pedestrian walkway. Projecting signs are prohibited on all residentially used and zoned properties.

                  4.3. - Temporary/special event signs. 
                  Signage may periodically be needed for a short duration rather than permanent usage. These signs shall not be erected within the public right-of-way and shall be located on private property with the permission of the property owner. Only one permit shall be issued to cover all temporary signs. The maximum number of temporary permits to be issued to a single parcel in a multi-family, commercial, or industrial district shall be four per year for a period of time not to exceed 30 days for each permit issued. Not more than one special event permit shall be issued per calendar quarter per business premises.

                  4.5-2  Commercial/industrial districts. 
                  (a)  Parcels may contain more than one freestanding sign, provided that: 
                  (1)  Unless otherwise stated in this ordinance, parcels exceeding three acres shall be allowed a maximum aggregate sign area of 300 square feet for the entire parcel, but no single sign shall have a display area exceeding 200 square feet. 
                  (2)  Unless otherwise stated in this ordinance, parcels less than three acres but greater than 30,000 square feet shall be allowed a maximum aggregate sign area of 128 square feet for the entire parcel.

                  4.6-3  Form and number. Billboard signs shall not be placed side-by-side or stacked. A sign at a single location, whether back-to-back or "V" formation, shall be the same height above the interstate highway surface. Not more than six billboard signs shall be permitted per quadrant of any interchange adjacent to the interstate highway. 
                  4.6-4  Height and setback. All billboard signs shall be a minimum of ten feet above adjacent interstate highway pavement measuring from the lower portion of the sign face. Non-interstate billboard signs shall not extend more than 40 feet in height above the adjacent ground. Interstate billboard signs shall not extend more than 70 feet in height above the adjacent ground. The following rules shall apply in determining adjacent ground: If the base of the sign structure is below the grade of the adjacent roadway, the sign height is measured from the elevation of the adjacent roadway that is nearest to the sign structure. The ground shall not be altered for the sole purpose of providing additional sign height. The edge of the display area for any sign structures shall be not less than ten feet from any property or right-of-way line. 
                  4.6-5  Spacing. Billboard signs shall be spaced a minimum of 500 feet apart measured on the same side of the roadway and from the closest point relative to each other. 
                  4.6-6  Illumination.

Non-interstate billboards, pylon signs and wall signs may have LED or digital displays. 
                  4.6-7  Extrusions prohibited. Extrusions beyond the face of the sign, excluding aprons, are prohibited. 
                  ARTICLE V. - NONCONFORMING USES 
                  Except as provided in this ordinance, all signs shall be subject to the provisions below, governing nonconforming uses. Such provisions, however, shall not be construed to prevent a legally operating nonconforming use from using signs otherwise permitted for similar conforming uses. 

                  5.1. - Continuance of nonconforming uses. 
                  The lawful use of land area or sign structure existing at the time of enactment of or subsequent amendment to this ordinance may be continued subject to the following restrictions even though such use does not conform with the provisions of this ordinance. 
                  Existing nonconforming sign structures shall not be: 
                  (1)  Changed to another nonconforming sign; 
                  (2)  Torn down and rebuilt or moved and rebuilt as a nonconforming sign; 
                  (3)  Extended or enlarged; or 
                  (4)  Rebuilt, altered, or repaired after damage exceeding 50 percent of the fair market value of the improvements, except when changed conditions beyond the control of the owner render the sign nonconforming or warrant the sign's repair. 
                  For the purpose of administration of this provision ordinary maintenance of a sign is not deemed to be or constitute an extension or enlargement of the sign; and changing the face of the sign is not deemed a change prohibited by this section. 
                  5.2. - Deterioration. 
                  Nonconforming signs which have been allowed to deteriorate so as to constitute either an aesthetic nuisance or a safety hazard are subject to removal pursuant to article VII of this ordinance. A sign shall be deemed to be deteriorated if the paint on its face is faded, cracked or peeling, if removable letters on the changeable copy board are missing or in disarray, if plastic panels are missing, broken or stained, if the sign face or its supporting frame work is rusty or in need of paint, if the area surrounding the sign base is not maintained and kept free of weeds and debris, or if the sign is in need of structural repair. 
                  5.3. - Abandonment. 
                  Nonconforming signs which have been abandoned, shall be removed in their entirety by the record owner of the building or the person who obtained the sign license, whichever owns the sign or portion thereof, within 90 days after the business using the sign closes or ceases to operate on the premises where the sign is located. 
                  5.4. - Relocation of existing nonconforming sign. 
                  Notwithstanding the limitation on existing nonconforming sign structures set out in section 5.1 of this article, the mayor and council are authorized to permit an existing nonconforming sign structure to be relocated and rebuilt upon the same or contiguous parcel if the mayor and council determine that such relocation would: 
                  (1)  Enhance the aesthetic value, economic value, or future development potential of the effected property; 
                  (2)  Not increase any dimensions of the original existing nonconforming sign structure; 
                  (3)  Not require any extension to the then-existing lease term, if any, of the nonconforming sign structure; and 
                  (4)  Not violate applicable zoning restrictions or permitting requirements. 
                  ARTICLE VI. - BOARD OF APPEALS 

                  6.1. - Procedures. 
                  An applicant whose permit application has been denied or a permittee who alleges that there is error in any order, requirement, decisions, or determination made by the zoning administrator or any other administrative official in connection with the enforcement of this ordinance, may appeal the decision to the zoning board of appeals as established by article VIII of the city zoning ordinance upon filing a written notice of an appeal with the zoning administrator within ten days of the challenged decision. The board of zoning appeals shall consider an appeal at the next meeting held after the city's receipt of the written notice of appeal, provided that the notice of appeal is received a minimum of five full business days before the meeting. If the appeal is not heard at the next meeting it shall be heard at the next regular meeting of the zoning board of appeals thereafter, but in any event no later than 45 days from the date the written notice of an appeal was filed with the zoning administrator. The zoning board of appeals shall make a final decision not later than 30 days from the date of the hearing. 
                  6.2. - Powers. 
                  The duly appointed zoning board of appeals shall have the power to reverse or amend the decision of the zoning administrator, and/or authorize a variance from the strict application of this ordinance where such application will result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships to the person owning or having the beneficial use of the property or sign for which the variance is sought. 
                  6.3. - Application of the variance power. 
                  A variance may be allowed by the board of appeals only in cases involving practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships when the evidence in the official record of the appeal supports all the following affirmative findings: 
                  (1)  That the alleged hardships or practical difficulties or both, are exceptional and peculiar to the property of the person requesting the variance, and result from conditions which do not exist generally throughout the city. 
                  (2)  That the alleged hardships and practical difficulties, or both, which will result from a failure to grant the variance, include substantially more than mere inconvenience, inability to attain a higher financial return, or both. (This is fairly standard variance language — it gives the commission a little wiggle room.) 
                  (3)  That allowing the variance will result in substantial justice being done: 
                  a.  Considering the public benefits intended to be secured by this ordinance; 
                  b.  The individual hardships that will be suffered by a failure of the board to grant a variance; and 
                  c.  The rights of others whose property would be affected by the allowance of the variance. 
                  (4)  That the requested variance is the minimum variance necessary to allow the applicant to enjoy the rights commonly enjoyed by others similarly situated. 
                  (5)  That granting of the variance would not violate more than one standard of this ordinance. 
                  The above findings of fact shall be made by the board of appeals, which is not empowered to grant a variance without an affirmative finding of fact on the categories above. Every finding of fact shall be supported in the record of the proceedings of the board. 
                  Nothing contained herein shall be construed to empower the board of appeals to change the terms of this ordinance or to add to the signs permitted in any district. 
                  6.4. - Appeals of decisions. 
                  Should the appellant wish to appeal the board's decision, the appellant must do so by writ of certiorari directly to the Superior Court of Catoosa County. There shall be no intermediate appeal to the mayor and council or any other administrative body. An application for a writ of certiorari must be filed within 30 days of the applicant's receipt of the written decision of the board. 
                  ARTICLE VII. - ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT 

                  7.1. - Sign permit. 
                  7.1-1 A sign permit is required before a permanent or temporary/special event sign may be erected or attached to, suspended from or supported on a building or structure; and before an existing sign may be enlarged, relocated or materially improved upon to an extent of 60 percent of its total replacement value. All signs using electrical wiring and connections shall require an electrical permit. 
                  7.1-2 A sign permit shall be issued by the code enforcement office/building inspector when the plans, specifications and intended use of the permanent sign or part thereof conform in all respects to the applicable provisions of this ordinance, the city building code, and the requirements of the electrical code as certified by the zoning administrator and a permit fee has been paid by the applicant. The administrative application shall be accompanied by plans or such other information (property lines, street names, building locations, distances from building to the road, distances to sign from road, along with a detailed drawing of the sign(s) itself) and such other information as the zoning administrator may reasonably require in the exercise of his duties. Standardized sign plans may be filed with the zoning administrator in fulfillment of this requirement, although site plans to determine the location of a sign shall be filed with each application. The zoning administrator shall process the application and either grant or deny the application within 30 business days from the date of receipt of a complete application and payment of the proper fee. The failure of zoning administrator to timely act on the application shall be deemed a grant of the application. 
                  7.1-3 Each permit application shall contain an agreement to indemnify and save the city harmless of all damages, demands or expenses, which may in any manner be caused by the sign(s) or sign structure. 
                  7.1-4 The city shall deny permits to applicants that submit applications for signs that either do not comply with the provisions of this ordinance, or for incomplete applications, or for applications containing false material statements. Should it be determined that a sign permit was erroneously issued, then such permit is void ab initio . Denial of a permit shall be expressed in writing by the zoning administrator before the end of the 30 business days established for review of the application and shall state the reasons for denial of the application. For the purposes of this ordinance, the communication may be made by email or facsimile. Alternatively, the city may personally serve the sign applicant with a copy of the written notice of denial within 30 business days after the city's receipt of the application. The sign applicant shall have the right to appeal the denial of a permit to the city's zoning board of appeals by written notice of appeal as provide in section 6.3 above. 
                  7.1-5 A sign permit shall become null and void if the sign for which the permit was issued has not been completed within a period of six months after the date of issuance. No refunds will be made for permit fees paid for permits that expired due to failure to erect a permitted sign. Where a permit has expired for failure to erect the sign and a sign is later desired in the same location, a new application must be processed and another fee paid in accordance with the fee schedule in effect at the time of re-application. 
                  7.2. - Permit fee. 
                  7.2-1 A permit fee shall be paid to the zoning administrator for each permit required by this ordinance. The fee shall be in accordance to rate schedule maintained in the office of the city manager. No permit shall be issued until the exact dimensions and area of the sign have been filed with the zoning administrator. 
                  7.2-2 Permit fees shall not apply to the ordinary servicing, repainting of existing sign message, cleaning of a sign, nor to changing of advertising on a sign specifically designed for periodic change of message without change in structure. 
                  7.3. - Construction and maintenance. 
                  All signs, together with all their supports, braces, guys, and anchors, shall be kept in constant repair and unless constructed of galvanized or non-corroding metal, shall be periodically given a protective coating. The area immediately in front of all freestanding signs shall be maintained free of high weeds and debris. In addition to the above provisions, the zoning administrator may cause any sign or structure which: 
                  (a)  Is structurally unsafe; or 
                  (b)  Constitutes a hazard to safety or health by reason of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation or abandonment; or 
                  (c)  Is not kept in good repair; or 
                  (d)  Is capable of causing electrical shocks, to be removed following notice of 24 hours to the owner, at the expense of the owner thereof, and to destroy or otherwise dispose of the same. 
                  7.4. - Enforcement. 
                  If any sign is erected or maintained in violation of the provisions of this ordinance, the zoning administrator shall have the power to give the owner thereof written notice of such violation, said notice to include a brief statement of the particulars in which such violation is to be remedied. If a sign has been registered with the zoning administrator, notice to the registered owner or the person or firm receiving the permit shall be sufficient. If a sign has not been registered and the owner is not known, affixing a copy of the notice to the sign, graphic structure, or building for a period of ten days shall be sufficient. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the interest of safety, any official or employee of the city shall have the authority to remove and dispose of any sign placed within the public right-of-way without notice to the owner. 
                  If such a violation is not remedied within 30 days after such notice, the owner shall remove the sign immediately or be subject to a $100.00 a day fine for each day the sign remains. If the sign is not removed by the owner, the zoning administrator shall have the right to remove such sign at the expense of the owner thereof and to destroy or otherwise dispose of the same. 
                  7.5. - New zoning districts. 
                  If a new zoning district is created after the initial enactment of this ordinance or subsequent amendment, no signs shall be permitted therein until this ordinance shall be amended to include such zone district. 
                  ARTICLE VIII. - ADOPTION AND AMENDMENTS 

                  8.1. - Adoption and amendment. 
                  This ordinance shall both be adopted and amended hereafter, only after the mayor and council shall have authorized the Ringgold Planning Commission or equivalent (hereafter known as the planning commission) to conduct a public hearing, then review and recommend the adoption or subsequent amendment. After conclusion of the required public hearing (section 8.2), the planning commission shall have 30 days within which to submit its written report to the mayor and council. If the planning commission fails to submit a report within the 30-day period it shall be deemed to have approved the adoption or subsequent amendment. 
                  8.2. - Public hearing. 
                  Before enacting an amendment to this ordinance, the planning commission of the City of Ringgold, Georgia, shall hold a public hearing thereon, and at least 15 days' notice of the date, time, place, and purpose shall be published in the legal organ of Catoosa County, Georgia. 
                  8.3. - Presentment to mayor and council. 
                  After the expiration of the 30-day period within which the planning commission must act, the mayor and council of the City of Ringgold may proceed to final action on the adoption or subsequent amendment.

Further, the Chairman may direct that the proponents and opponents designate one or more spokesperson(s) for the presentation of views on a proposed zoning amendment or conditional use.

                  Upon conclusion of the presentation of persons opposing the proposed zoning amendment or conditional use, the Chairman shall offer the proponent of the zoning amendment or proponent's designee a specified amount of time to address the Commission in rebuttal of any issue raised by persons addressing the Commission in opposition to the proposed zoning amendment or conditional use. The Chairman shall rule out of order any new issue raised in rebuttal unless deemed useful to the Commission in evaluating the merits of the proposed zoning amendment or conditional use.

                  The following factors are determined to be relevant in balancing the interests in promoting the public health, safety, morality, and/or general welfare against the right to unrestricted use of property: 
                  a)  Whether the proposed amendment would allow a use that is generally suitable for the site compared to other possible uses and the uses and zoning of adjacent and nearby properties. 
                  b)  Whether the proposed amendment would adversely affect the economic value or the uses of adjacent, abutting, and nearby properties. 
                  c)  Whether the extent to which the destruction or diminishing of the value of the lot or parcel proposed for zoning amendment promotes the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the public. 
                  d)  Whether the property to be affected by the proposed amendment can be used as currently zoned considering the suitability of the subject lot or parcel for the proposed zoned purposes. 
                  e)  Whether the relative gain to the general public, as compared to the hardship imposed upon the owner of the subject lot or parcel under the current zoning substantially promotes the general welfare of the public. 
                  f)  The length of time the property has been vacant as zoned, considered in the context of land development in the area and in the vicinity of the proposed land to be rezoned. 
                  g)  Whether the lot or parcel sought to be rezoned/annexed under the proposed amendment is in conformity or divergence with the policy and intent of the adopted Joint Comprehensive Plan/equivalent, as amended.

                  The mayor and council and the Commission, in its advisory recommendation to the Mayor and council, shall consider the proposed zoning amendment or conditional use in light of the factors set forth in Section 1-8 or Section 1-9, as applicable. In evaluating the factors set forth in Section 1-8 it shall be the policy of the City to exercise its zoning power in conformity with the adopted policies and intent of the current and adopted comprehensive plan of the City, insofar as the plan is current in its application to development patterns in the area sought to be zoned or rezoned. The policy of the City is to exercise its zoning power for purposes of assuring the compatibility of usage of adjacent and nearby properties and the preservation of the economic value of adjacent and nearby properties, while enabling a use of all properties measured by the U.S. Constitution and the Georgia Constitution.

                  c)  Whether the proposed use will not be detrimental to the use, peaceful enjoyment, economic value, or development of surrounding properties or the general neighborhood and will cause not objectionable noise, vibrations, fumes, odors, dust, glare, or physical activity, nor will be injurious or likely to create a nuisance; 
                  d)  Whether the proposed use will not adversely affect the health, safety, security, morals, or general welfare or residents, visitor or workers in the area; and 
                  e)  Whether the proposed use will be served by adequate public services and facilities including schools, police and fire protection, water, sanitary sewers, public roads, storm drainage, and other public improvements.

                  Upon conclusion of the public hearing before the Commission, the Commission may make a recommendation to either approve, disapprove, or table the proposed zoning amendment or conditional use. If consideration of the proposed zoning amendment or conditional use is tabled, it shall be reconsidered by the Commission not later than sixty (60) days after the close of the public hearing. If the Commission tables their recommendation, then the scheduled public hearing of the mayor and council may continue, however the mayor and council shall await the recommendation of the commission before taking final action. The rules of the Commission shall provide for a regular monthly meeting during each calendar month. If no advisory recommendation is submitted to the mayor and council within sixty (60) days of the close of the public hearing on any zoning amendment or conditional use, the Commission shall be deemed to have made a favorable recommendation of the proposed zoning amendment or conditional use. The application for zoning amendment or conditional use shall not be withdrawn once the Commission opens and conducts the public hearing. The Commission shall make a recommendation to the mayor and council on the proposed zoning amendment or conditional use regardless whether the proponent of the zoning amendment or conditional use attempts to, thereafter, withdraw his/her application of the zoning amendment or conditional use.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any approval of a proposed zoning amendment or conditional use may be subject to any and all lawful conditions that may be required by the mayor and council as a condition of the approval of the proposed zoning amendment or conditional use.
