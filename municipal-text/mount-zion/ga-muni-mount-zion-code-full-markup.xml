PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Mount Zion, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances and resolutions adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Bill Sweeney, Code Attorney, and Ramona Connors, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Teresa Ferguson, City Clerk, David Mecklin, City Attorney and Randy Sims, Mayor for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

                  (2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles. 
                  (3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers. 
                  (4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ through ____________ " (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code that embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code). 
                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
                  Sec. 1-12. - Altering Code. 
                  It shall be unlawful for any person in the city to change or amend, by additions or deletions, any part or portion of this Code, or to insert or delete pages, or portions of pages, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner whatsoever which will cause the law of the city to be misrepresented thereby, unless so authorized by ordinance or resolution or other official act of the city council.

                  (a)  In the event that any city employee responsible for or involved in restoring an existing covered account or accepting payment for a covered account becomes aware of red flags indicating possible identity theft with respect to existing covered accounts, such employee shall use his discretion to determine whether such red flag or combination of red flags suggests a threat of identity theft. If, in his discretion, such employee determines that identity theft or attempted identity theft is likely or probable, such employee shall immediately report such red flags to the city clerk. If, in his discretion, such employee deems that identity theft is unlikely or that reliable information is available to reconcile red flags, the employee shall convey this information to the city police chief, who may, in his discretion, determine that no further action is necessary. If the city police chief, in his discretion, determines that further action is necessary, a city employee shall perform one or more of the following responses, as determined to be appropriate by the city police chief: 
                  (1)  Contact the customer; 
                  (2)  Make the following changes to the account if, after contacting the customer, it is apparent that someone other than the customer has accessed the customer's covered account: 
                  a.  Change any account numbers, passwords, security codes, or other security devices that permit access to an account; or 
                  b.  Close the account; 
                  (3)  Cease attempts to collect additional charges from the customer and decline to sell the customer's account to a debt collector in the event that the customer's account has been accessed without authorization and such access has caused additional charges to accrue; 
                  (4)  Notify a debt collector within 12 hours of the discovery of likely or probable identity theft relating to a customer account that has been sold to such debt collector in the event that a customer's account has been sold to a debt collector prior to the discovery of the likelihood or probability of identity theft relating to such account; 
                  (5)  Notify law enforcement, in the event that someone other than the customer has accessed the customer's account causing additional charges to accrue or accessing personal identifying information; or 
                  (6)  Take other appropriate action to prevent or mitigate identity theft. 
                  (b)  In the event that any city employee responsible for or involved in opening a new covered account becomes aware of red flags indicating possible identity theft with respect to an application for a new account, such employee shall use his discretion to determine whether such red flag or combination of red flags suggests a threat of identity theft. If, in his discretion, such employee determines that identity theft or attempted identity theft is likely or probable, such employee shall immediately report such red flags to the city police chief. If, in his discretion, such employee deems that identity theft is unlikely or that reliable information is available to reconcile red flags, the employee shall convey this information to the city police chief, who may, in his discretion, determine that no further action is necessary. If the city police chief, in his discretion, determines that further action is necessary, a city employee shall perform one or more of the following responses, as determined to be appropriate by the supervisor: 
                  (1)  Request additional identifying information from the applicant; 
                  (2)  Deny the application for the new account; 
                  (3)  Notify law enforcement of possible identity theft; or 
                  (4)  Take other appropriate action to prevent or mitigate identity theft.

                  Sec. 2-56. - Updating the program. 
                  The city council shall annually review and, as deemed necessary by the council, update the identity theft prevention program along with any relevant red flags in order to reflect changes in risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the city and its covered accounts from identity theft.

The mayor or his designee is responsible for reviewing reports prepared by staff regarding compliance with red flag requirements and with recommending material changes to the program, as necessary in the opinion of the mayor, to address changing identity theft risks and to identify new or discontinued types of covered accounts. Any recommended material changes to the program shall be submitted to the city council for consideration by the city clerk. 
                  (1)  The city clerk will report to the mayor at least annually, on compliance with the red flag requirements. The report will address material matters related to the program and evaluate issues such as: 
                  a.  The effectiveness of the policies and procedures of the city in addressing the risk of identity theft in connection with the opening of covered accounts and with respect to existing covered accounts; 
                  b.  Service provider arrangements; 
                  c.  Significant incidents involving identity theft and management's response; and 
                  d.  Recommendations for material changes to the program. 
                  (2)  The city clerk is responsible for providing training to all employees responsible for or involved in opening a new covered account, restoring an existing covered account or accepting payment for a covered account with respect to the implementation and requirements of the identity theft prevention program. The city clerk shall exercise his discretion in determining the amount and substance of training necessary.

                  ARTICLE VI. - EMPLOYEE SUBSTANCE ABUSE POLICY 

                  Sec. 2-138. - Policy purpose and guidelines. 
                  (a)  The city is committed to providing a safe work environment and to fostering the well-being and health of its employees. That commitment is jeopardized when a city employee illegally uses drugs on or off the job, or abuses alcohol on the job. Therefore, the city has established the following policy: 
                  (1)  It is a violation of city policy for any employee to use, possess, sell, trade, offer for sale, or offer to buy illegal drugs or otherwise engage in the illegal use of drugs on or off the job. 
                  (2)  It is a violation of city policy for any employee to report to work under the influence of or while possessing in his body, blood or urine illegal drugs in any detectable amount. 
                  (3)  It is a violation of city policy for any employee to report to work under the influence of or impaired by alcohol. 
                  (4)  It is a violation of the city policy for any employee to use prescription drugs illegally, i.e., to use prescription drugs that have not been legally obtained or in a manner or for a purpose other than as prescribed. However, nothing in this policy precludes the appropriate use of legally prescribed medications. 
                  (5)  Violations of this policy are subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination. 
                  (b)  It is the responsibility of city supervisors to counsel employees whenever they see changes in performance or behavior that suggest an employee has a drug problem. Although it is not the supervisor's job to diagnose personal problems, the supervisor should encourage such employees to seek help and advise them about available resources for getting help. Everyone shares responsibility for maintaining a safe work environment, and co-workers should encourage anyone who has a drug problem to seek help. 
                  (c)  The goal of this policy is to balance our respect for individuals with the need to maintain a safe, productive and drug-free environment. The intent of this policy is to offer a helping hand to those who need it, while sending a clear message that the illegal use of drugs and the abuse of alcohol are incompatible with employment at the city. 
                  (d)  As a condition of employment, employees must abide by the terms of this policy and must notify the city in writing of any conviction of a violation of a criminal drug statute no later than five calendar days after such conviction. 
                  (e)  The city offers resource information on various means of employee assistance in our community, including, but not limited to, drug and alcohol abuse programs. Employees are encouraged to use this resource file, which is located on the bulletin boards in each department. In addition, we will distribute this information to employees for their confidential use. 
                  (f)  An employee reporting to work visibly impaired will be deemed unable to properly perform required duties and will not be allowed to work. If possible, the employee's supervisor will first seek another supervisor's opinion to confirm the employee's status. Next, the supervisor will consult privately with the employee to determine the cause of the observation, including whether substance abuse has occurred. If, in the opinion of the supervisor, the employee is considered impaired, the employee will be sent home or to a medical facility by a safe transportation alternative depending on the determination of the observed impairment, accompanied by the supervisor or another employee if necessary. A drug test may be in order. An impaired employee will not be allowed to drive. 
                  (g)  Employees and job applicants who have a positive confirmed test result may explain or contest the result to the city within five working days after the city contacts the employee or job applicant and shows him the positive test result as it was received from the laboratory in writing. 
                  (h)  The confidentiality of any information received by the employer through substance abuse testing shall be maintained, except as otherwise provided by law. 
                  (i)  All job applicants at the city will undergo testing for the presence of illegal drugs as a condition of employment. Any applicant with a confirmed positive test will be denied employment. 
                  (j)  Applicants will be required to submit voluntarily to a urinalysis test at a laboratory chosen by the city and, by signing a consent agreement, will release the city from liability. 
                  (k)  The city has adopted testing practices to identify employees who use illegal drugs on or off the job or who abuse alcohol on the job. It shall be a condition of employment for all employees to submit to substance abuse testing under the following circumstances: 
                  (1)  When there is reasonable suspicion to believe that an employee is using illegal drugs or abusing alcohol. Reasonable suspicion is based on a belief that an employee is using or has used drugs or alcohol in violation of the employer's policy drawn from specific objective and articulate facts and reasonable inferences drawn from those facts in light of experience. Among other things, such facts and inferences may be based upon, but not limited to, the following: 
                  a.  Observable phenomena while at work, such as direct observation of substance abuse or of the physical symptoms or manifestations of being impaired due to substance abuse; 
                  b.  Abnormal conduct or erratic behavior while at work or a significant deterioration in work performance; 
                  c.  A report of substance abuse provided by a reliable and credible source; 
                  d.  Evidence that an individual has tampered with any substance abuse test during his employment with the current employer; 
                  e.  Information that an employee has caused or contributed to an accident while at work; or 
                  f.  Evidence that an employee has used, possessed, sold, solicited or transferred drugs while working or while on the employer's premises or while operating the employer's vehicle, machinery or equipment. 
                  (2)  When employees have caused or contributed to an on-the-job injury that resulted in a loss of work time, which means any period of time during which an employee stops performing the normal duties of employment and leaves the place of employment to seek care from a licensed medical provider. An employer may send employees for a substance abuse test if they are involved in an on-the-job accident where personal injury or damage to city property occurs. 
                  (3)  As part of a follow-up program to treatment for drug abuse. 
                  (4)  When a substance abuse test is conducted as part of a routinely scheduled employee fitness-for-duty medical examination that is part of the employer's established policy or that is scheduled routinely for all members of an employment classification or group. 
                  (l)  Employees with a confirmed positive test result may, at their option and expense, have a second confirmation test made on the same specimen. An employee will not be allowed to submit another specimen for testing. 
                  (m)  If the physician, official or lab personnel have reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee has tampered with specimen, the employee is subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.

                  (Ord. No. 2018-002, § 1(020), 5-8-2018) 
                  Sec. 2-167. - Ethics. 
                  It is the policy of the city to seek the best overall value when procuring goods and services. Toward this end, the city finds and declares that its objectives will best be achieved through an open, competitive process with a broad range of responsible vendors wishing to furnish products and services to the city. The city will set up and conduct a procurement program that maximizes service benefits to the community and awards contracts to vendors who offer the best value. 
                  (1)  The city declares that city employees and officials along with those wishing to do business with the city have the shared responsibility for avoiding biased, anticompetitive or unethical practices when such receipt has the potential to influence a procurement decision or to gain undue advantage in a procurement competition. 
                  (2)  Every officer and employee of the city whose duties involve the purchase or sale of goods and/or services, or the preparation of specifications for the purchase of goods and/or services for the city, or deciding which goods shall be declared surplus are expressly prohibited from seeking, requesting, or receiving any material payment, gift, job offer, security, promise of future benefit, or any other tangible or intangible thing of value, directly or indirectly, from any person, company, firm or corporation which seeks to do business with or contract with the city or has contracted with the city within the preceding 12 months, or to which any purchase order or contract is awarded, or to whom any surplus goods may be sold. 
                  (3)  Prospective vendors must compete for city business within the parameters of the solicitation process and are prohibited from seeking to obtain inside information, attempting to skew the writing of specifications or influencing a procurement decision through any means outside the process established for the particular solicitation. This principle applies to any contractor, subcontractor, representative, employee or agent that may be associated with a procurement transaction. 
                  (4)  The city's ethics ordinance and city Charter should be consulted for requirements related to lobbying and representation of business interests that come before the city council or city officials for decision. 
                  (5)  Ethical business practices are important both during a solicitation and after the decision to grant an award. To this end, the city seeks to establish relationships with business partners whose ongoing ethical standards of business conduct are congruent with those outlined here. 
                  (6)  A vendor's contract compliance history with the city and other contractual parties is a valid element in the decision to award a solicitation. 
                  (7)  The city stipulates that the furtherance of its strategic goals for job creation, stability and growth in the tax base, business retention, and other fiscal and economic development objectives may be considered during the procurement process. The mayor and council are authorized to establish procurement initiatives consistent with the city's strategic economic development objectives. These procurement practices shall be applied consistently and equitably, and shall have a direct relationship to the city's goals. 
                  (8)  The city employees, officials, and their family members are generally prohibited from participation in any procurement decision or any gain of undue advantage in a procurement competition as a result of contemporaneous employment with a potential or actual business partner. 
                  (9)  It is unethical for any city employee or elected official to purchase commodities or services from a city contract for personal use. 
                  (10)  Individuals, firms and businesses seeking an award of a city contract may not initiate or continue any verbal or written communications regarding a solicitation with any city officer, elected official, employee or other city representative other than the designated individual named in the solicitation between the date of the issuance of the solicitation and the date of the final contract award by the city council. The mayor and council will review violations. If determined that such communication has compromised the competitive process, the offer submitted by the individual, firm or business may be disqualified from consideration for award.

                  Sec. 2-168. - Disclaimer of responsibility for improper purchasing. 
                  The city council may disclaim responsibility and liability for any purchase, expenditure, or agreement for expenditure arising from procurement made in its name, or in the name of any governmental body under its authority, by an unauthorized person or any person acting outside this article or the authorization or delegation as provided in this article. The expense of any such disclaimed transaction will become the personal liability of the individual who acted improperly. 
                  (Ord. No. 2018-002, § 1(061), 5-8-2018) 
                  Sec. 2-169. - Evasion prohibited. 
                  No purchase or sale shall be artificially divided for the purpose of evading the provisions of this article. Neither shall this process be used for frequently recurring acquisitions that warrant volume purchases or periodic term contracts. 
                  (Ord. No. 2018-002, § 1(070), 5-8-2018) 
                  Sec. 2-170. - Summary of methods of procurement. 
                  In most cases, this article recognizes seven methods of procurement and the conditions where each method shall be used. 
                  (1)  Informal purchase. Those purchases $10,000.00 or less do not justify the administrative time and expense for the conduct of competitive sealed bids or proposals. 
                  (2)  Competitive sealed bidding. In most cases, the competitive sealed bid is the preferred method of procurement in the public sector and should be used whenever possible as it allows qualified, responsive bidders to compete on the basis of price. Generally, the following conditions must be met: 
                  a.  Clear and adequate specifications are available. 
                  b.  Three or more responsible bidders are willing to participate in the process. 
                  c.  Cost of materials, supplies, equipment, services or project is greater than $10,000.00. 
                  d.  Revenue is greater than $10,000.00. 
                  (3)  Competitive sealed proposal. When use of the competitive sealed bid is either not practical or not advantageous to the city, a contract may be entered into by use of the competitive sealed proposal. Use of the proposal is dependent upon such factors as: 
                  a.  Whether quality, availability or capability is overriding in relation to price in procurement of technical supplies or technical or professional services. 
                  b.  Whether the initial installation needs to be evaluated together with subsequent maintenance and service capabilities and what priorities should be given these requirements in the city's best interest. 
                  c.  Whether a fixed price or cost type contract is more advantageous. 
                  d.  Whether the market place will respond better to a solicitation permitting not only a range of alternate proposals, but evaluation and discussion of them before making the award. 
                  e.  Cost of equipment, services or project is greater than $10,000.00. 
                  f.  Revenue is greater than $10,000.00. 
                  (4)  Sole source purchase. A sole source procurement may be used when only one vendor or supplier is able to fill requirements for the intended use. Sole source may be used for compatibility with equipment for repair purposes, or for compatibility with existing systems. Standardization may require a sole source procurement, depending upon the intended use. Standardization, which is either established as a result of past procurements or by approval of the mayor and council, can be a satisfactory justification for a sole source. The city council shall approve all purchases where cost is greater than $10,000.00. 
                  (5)  Emergency purchase. The city shall have the authority to purchase commodities and services where there exists an emergency constituting a threat to public health, safety or welfare or to the soundness and integrity of public property or to the delivery of essential services and where the adverse effects of such emergency may worsen materially with the passage of time. Acquisitions shall be made using such competitive procedures as circumstances reasonably permit. All emergencies where cost is greater than $10,000.00 require ratification of the city council. 
                  (6)  Cooperative purchase. The city may participate in a cooperative purchase for commodities, supplies and services when determined that it is in the best interest of the city. The sponsoring entity, whether federal, state or local, must have performed a competitive procurement process and entered into a contract that stipulates allowance for other governmental entities to purchase from the supplier at the same price and under the same terms and conditions as extended to it. If such arrangement has not been made a part of the contract, written permission from the sponsoring entity and the awarded supplier must be obtained. Cooperative purchases where the cost is greater than $10,000.00 shall be approved by the city council. 
                  (7)  Governmental and affiliated entity purchase. The city may purchase services and incidental commodities from other federal, state or local governments, associations and nonprofit organizations when determined to be in the best interest of the city. Such purchases where cost is greater than $10,000.00 shall be approved by the city council. 
                  (Ord. No. 2018-002, § 1(080), 5-8-2018) 
                  Sec. 2-171. - Mandatory pre-qualification process. 
                  (a)  Public works construction contracts governed by O.C.G.A. § 36-91-20 et seq. The city is hereby delegated the authority to administer a process for mandatory pre-qualification of prospective bidders for public works construction contracts pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-91-20(f). 
                  (b)  All other contracts. The city is authorized to determine that a process for mandatory pre-qualification for competitive sealed bids and competitive sealed proposals of bidders or proposers is appropriate for the procurement of a particular commodity or service, subject to the following requirements: 
                  (1)  Criteria for pre-qualification shall be reasonably related to the project or the quality of the work. 
                  (2)  Criteria for pre-qualification shall be available to any prospective bidder requesting such information. 
                  (3)  There shall be a method of notifying prospective bidders of the criteria for pre-qualification. 
                  (4)  There shall be a procedure for a disqualified bidder to respond to his disqualification to the city; however, such procedure shall not include a formal appeal. 
                  (5)  No bid or proposal shall be eligible for consideration by the city from a prospective bidder who has not been pre-qualified on the procurement in question where the invitation to bid or request for proposals specified that pre-qualification would be mandatory, and any bid or proposal received shall be returned to the prospective bidder unopened. 
                  (Ord. No. 2018-002, § 1(081), 5-8-2018) 
                  Sec. 2-172. - Purchases based on informal procurement. 
                  (a)  General. Procurements that involve amounts $10,000.00 or less do not require a formal sealed bid/proposal process. However, the processes used for this type of procurement will include as much competition as is consistent with the anticipated cost of the procurement and the best interest of the city. 
                  (b)  Prohibition of improper use of informal purchase process. Purchases may not be artificially divided as to constitute an informal purchase, thereby circumventing the dollar limit requirement for competitive sealed bids/proposals. 
                  (c)  Procedures. Procurement within this category shall be made in accordance with the informal purchase procedures established by the city. These procedures will cover purchases delegated to user departments as well as those handled through the central procurement process. Such operational procedures shall provide for obtaining adequate and reasonable competition for the supply, service or construction being purchased. Further, such operational procedures shall require the preparation and maintenance of written records to adequately document the competition obtained, properly account for the funds expended and facilitate audit/review of the transaction. 
                  (d)  Types of informal purchases. Informal purchases are classified by two categories: 
                  (1)  Those that may be made directly by the using department. 
                  (2)  Those that are required to be made through the central procurement process. 
                  (e)  Informal purchase by user departments. 
                  (1)  Authority. Each user department is granted the authority, at the discretion of the mayor and/or council, to handle purchases where the cost is less than $2,500.00. 
                  (2)  Prohibition of misuse. Purchases may not be artificially divided in order to qualify for handling by the using departments; neither shall this process be used for frequently recurring acquisitions that warrant volume purchases or periodic term contracts. 
                  (Ord. No. 2018-002, § 1(090), 5-8-2018) 
                  Sec. 2-173. - Competitive sealed bids. 
                  (a)  Acquisitions greater than $10,000.00. Any commodity that is expected to cost or generate revenue greater than $10,000.00 shall be acquired through the competitive sealed bid process, except as otherwise provided in this article. 
                  (b)  Dissemination of invitation to bid. Public notice of an invitation to bid shall be given as required by state law. The public notice shall contain a general description of the purchase, shall state the location where documents may be obtained and the date, time and place of bid opening. Notice of any required bonding and insurance shall be included in the public notice. A copy of such notice shall be posted with the city. Any other methods of advertisement identified as likely to result in additional competition may be used in addition to required advertisement, at the discretion of the purchasing agent. 
                  (c)  Receipt of bid. No written bid shall be eligible for consideration by the city unless it is placed in a sealed envelope or package and actually received by the city by the date and time specified in the invitation to bid. All bids shall be stamped or annotated with the date and time of receipt and secured until the designated opening time. A bid delivered late may not be eligible for consideration by the city. 
                  (d)  Bid opening. Bids shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses on the date and at the time and place designated in the invitation to bid. The name of each bidder, the purchase price contained in each bid, and such other information as the purchasing agent deems appropriate shall be announced as the bids are opened. A record of bid information shall be recorded and available for public inspection. 
                  (e)  Modification of bid. Any clerical mistake that is patently obvious on the face of a bid, subject to the limitations described below, may be corrected upon written request and verification, submitted by the bidder. A non-material omission in a bid may be corrected if the city determines the correction to be in the city's best interest. Omissions affecting or relating to any of the following shall be deemed material and shall not be corrected after bid opening: 
                  (1)  Price information. 
                  (2)  Any required bonding. 
                  (f)  Withdrawal of bid. Bids may be withdrawn at any time prior to the bid opening. After bids have been publicly opened, withdrawal of bid shall be based upon the following: 
                  (1)  The bidder shall give notice in writing of his claim of right to withdraw his bid due to an error within two business days after the conclusion of the bid opening procedure. 
                  (2)  Bids may be withdrawn from consideration if the price was substantially lower than the other bids due solely to a mistake therein, provided the bid was submitted in good faith, and the mistake was a clerical mistake as opposed to a judgment mistake, and was actually due to an unintentional arithmetic error or an unintentional omission of a quantity of work, labor or material made directly in the compilation of the bid, which unintentional arithmetic error or unintentional omission can be clearly shown by objective evidence drawn from inspection of original work papers, documents and materials used in the preparation of the bid sought to be withdrawn. The bidder's original work papers shall be the sole acceptable evidence of error and mistake if request is made to withdraw the bid. If a bid is withdrawn under the authority of this provision, the lowest remaining responsive bid shall be deemed to be the low bid. 
                  (g)  Bid evaluation. Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitation to bid. No criteria may be used in bid evaluation that is not specifically set forth in the solicitation. 
                  (h)  Bid cancellation. An invitation to bid may be canceled prior to opening date or any or all bids may be rejected in whole or in part as may be specified in the solicitation, where it is in the best interest of the city in accordance with regulations promulgated by the purchasing office or as a result of improper conduct on the part of a city employee. The reasons for any cancellation shall be made part of the bid file. 
                  (i)  Bid award. 
                  (1)  Responsive and responsible bidder. Subject to approval by the mayor and city council, bids shall be awarded to the responsible bidder who have submitted the lowest cost responsive bid, highest revenue responsive bid, or whose bid represents the best value to the city. 
                  (2)  Approval of bid. All bid awards for amounts greater than $10,000.00 (cost or revenue) shall be approved by the mayor and city council. 
                  (3)  Rejection or deferral of bid. The city may reject bids, or may defer bid awards to allow time for additional evaluation or review of bids or for other business purposes, consistent with the best interest of the city. 
                  (4)  Disqualification of bid. The following types of bids shall be disqualified for consideration for a bid award: 
                  a.  A proposal submitted without required bonds. 
                  b.  A proposal submitted by an individual, firm or business on the ineligible source list. 
                  c.  A proposal which is incomplete in any material fact. 
                  d.  A proposal submitted by an individual, firm or business that has litigation pending against the city, or anyone representing a firm or business in litigation against the city, not arising out of the procurement process. 
                  (5)  Tie bids. In the event two responsive bids are tied for the lowest price and the other terms and conditions of the two bids are substantially the same, the bid shall be awarded to the local vendor if only one of the bidders has an office located within the boundaries of the city. If both or neither of the tied bidders are local vendors, the city shall request the firm's best and final offers, and the award shall be to the lowest bid. 
                  (Ord. No. 2018-002, § 1(100), 5-8-2018) 
                  Sec. 2-174. - Competitive sealed proposals. 
                  (a)  Acquisitions greater than $10,000.00. Any item or service which is expected to cost or generate revenue greater than $10,000.00, when the competitive sealed bid process is not applicable nor in the best interest of the city, shall be acquired through the competitive sealed proposal process, except as otherwise provided in this article. 
                  (b)  Dissemination of proposal. Proposals shall be disseminated through a request for proposal. Public notice shall be advertised as required by state law. The public notice shall contain a general description of the item or service to be purchased, shall state the location where documents may be obtained and the date, time and place of proposal receipt. Notice of any required bonding and insurance shall be included in the public notice. A copy of such notice shall be posted in the purchasing office. Any other methods of advertisement identified as likely to result in additional competition may be used in addition to required advertisement, at the discretion of the purchasing agent. 
                  (c)  Receipt of proposal. No written proposal shall be eligible for consideration by the city unless it is placed in a sealed envelope or package and actually received by the city by the date and time specified in the request for proposals.

                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 4-1. - Purpose and authority to regulate alcoholic beverages in city. 
                  (a)  This chapter has been enacted in furtherance of the police powers of the city and in accordance with a plan designed for the purposes, among others, of promoting the health and general welfare of the community by establishing reasonable standards for the regulation and control of the licensing and sales of alcoholic beverages. It is intended to protect and preserve schools and places of worship; to give effect to existing land use and to preserve residential areas, with reasonable considerations, among others, to the character of the areas and their peculiar suitability for particular uses; to minimize congestion in the roads and streets; to promote economic and development activity within those areas of the city having the road structure and sewerage capacity to handle additional and larger concentrations of lodging and dining facilities; and with a general view of promoting desirable living conditions and sustaining stability of neighborhood and property values, it is intended to protect against the evils of concentration of ownership or control of the retail outlets for alcoholic beverages and to prevent persons of ill repute from controlling the retail alcoholic beverage industry within the boundaries of the city. 
                  (b)  The provisions of this chapter are ordained under and by virtue of the authority granted by the laws of the state, O.C.G.A. § 3-3-1 et seq., Regulation of Alcoholic Beverages Generally. To adopt all reasonable rules and regulations as may fall within the police powers of the municipality to regulate and impose taxes on any such business; O.C.G.A. § 3-4-110, granting each municipality the full power to adopt all reasonable rules and regulations governing the location and conduct of any such licensee, including, but not limited to, the regulation of hours of business, types of employees, and other matters which may fall within the police powers of such municipality; O.C.G.A. §§ 3-5-40 and 3-5-42, authorizing municipal licenses for the business of manufacturing, distributing and selling malt beverages at wholesale and retail; O.C.G.A. § 3-6-40, authorizing municipal licenses for the manufacturing, distributing and selling of wine at wholesale and retail; O.C.G.A. § 3-11-3, authorizing sales off-premises for catered functions by licensed caterers; O.C.G.A. § 3-9-3, authorizing issuance of temporary permits for sale by nonprofit civic organizations of alcoholic beverages for consumption only on-premises; O.C.G.A. §§ 3-9-10 and 3-9-11, authorizing licensing and regulation of in-room service of alcoholic beverages by licensed hotels and motels. 
                  (c)  The provisions of this chapter regulating the sale of alcoholic beverages on the premises are ordained by virtue of the authority granted by the constitution and laws of the United States and state, as most recently delineated by the supreme court of the state in its decisions of Gravely vs. Bacon, and S.J.T., Inc. vs. Richmond County, in order to avoid the effects of criminal interests and negative effects on the community by the decreased safety and welfare of the city's citizens, the hindering of commercial growth in the city, and the deterioration of the city's economic base.

                  (a)  Any license which has been issued or which may hereafter be issued by the city may be suspended or revoked for due cause as hereinafter defined. Due cause, for purposes of this section, shall include, but not be limited to: 
                  (1)  Arrest or conviction (to include a plea of guilty or nolo contendere) by local, state or federal authorities of the licensee, a license representative, or any employee of the licensee (as to an "employee," for an act taking place while on duty at the licensed facility or in conjunction with the employee's employment), for any felony, or any misdemeanor of a crime opposed to decency and morality, or any law, regulation or ordinance involving beverage alcohol, gambling, or tax law violations; 
                  (2)  Citations issued by local, state or federal authorities to the licensee, license representative or any employees of the licensee for violations of any part of this chapter or any regulation pertaining to state or federal licensing of the possession, sale or distribution of beverage alcohol; 
                  (3)  Suspension or revocation of any state license required as condition for the possession, sale or distribution of beverage alcohol; 
                  (4)  Material falsification of any fact given in application for a license issued under this chapter or bearing upon the licensee's qualification therefor; any act which may be construed as a subterfuge in an effort to circumvent any of the qualifications for a license under this chapter shall be deemed a violation of the requirement attempted to be circumvented; 
                  (5)  The licensed business fails to properly account for, file, report and maintain any records or remit or pay any renewal license fee imposed, sales taxes, or excise taxes required under the city ordinances; 
                  (6)  Any other factors known to the licensing authority whereby it is objectively shown the licensee, by reason of business experience, financial standing, trade association, personal association, record of arrests, or reputation in any community in which he has resided, is not likely to maintain the operation for which he is licensed in conformity with federal, state or local laws. 
                  With respect to this section, it shall be rebuttably presumed that the violative act was done with the knowledge or consent of the licensee; provided, however, that such presumption may be rebutted only by evidence which precludes every other reasonable hypothesis save that such licensee did not know, assist or aide in such occurrence, or in the exercise of full diligence could not have discovered or prevented such activity. 
                  (b)  Action to suspend or revoke a license, other than a temporary or emergency suspension, shall be commenced by the city clerk making written recommendation to the city council, and giving written notice to the licensee, either by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal service upon the licensee or his agent at the licensed location, stating the grounds therefor, and the date, time and place such matter will be heard by the city council. Notice shall be served at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing. Included in the notice shall be an advisement of the licensee's right to be heard before the council. Any licensee requiring subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses or documents at the hearing shall file a written request with the city clerk at least five days prior to the hearing. Hearings may be continued for good cause only. 
                  (c)  All final decisions to suspend or revoke a license shall be made by the city council, in writing, with the reasons therefor stated. Notice of a final decision shall be given to the licensee within seven full business days after the hearing. Failure to notify the licensee shall not result in an automatic approval for the continued operation of the licensed premises or the continued good standing of the license, but shall require a new hearing on the matter by the city council, after proper notice is once again given in accordance with subsection (b) of this section. 
                  (d)  Hearings to suspend or revoke a license shall only be as formal as necessary to preserve order and shall be compatible with the principles of justice. The city attorney or his designee shall present the city's case and bear the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that due cause exists to suspend or revoke the license. The licensee may be represented by legal counsel, may confront and cross examine witnesses, and shall have the right to call witnesses and present evidence in his behalf. A hearing record shall be maintained by the city; however, either party may arrange for transcription by a court reporter at his sole expense. Hearings shall be presided over by the mayor who shall preserve order and rule upon all matter of evidence. Irrelevant, immaterial and unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded. 
                  (e)  Upon the second suspension or revocation of a license within any five-year period, as a prerequisite or reinstatement or reissuance of the license, the licensee, in addition to the requisite fees assessed under this chapter, shall post a surety bond, payable to the city, in the amount of $5,000.00, conditioned upon the licensee maintaining the operation for which he is licensed in conformity with all federal, state and local laws, ordinances, rules and regulations. Upon any subsequent act giving due cause for suspension or revocation of the license, the bond shall be forfeited and the license revoked.

                  Sec. 6-22. - Purpose; scope. 
                  (a)  It is the intent of this article to make animal owners responsible and accountable for the actions, behavior and conditions of their animals. 
                  (b)  Nothing in this article shall be interpreted or applied so as to create any power or duty in conflict with the preemptive effect of any federal, state or municipal law. 
                  (Ord. of 10-11-2005, att.(14-52)) 
                  Sec. 6-23. - Animal control. 
                  (a)  Generally. An animal owner's premises shall be maintained in such a manner as not to constitute either a private nuisance to adjoining property owners or a nuisance to the public generally. Pens or enclosures in which animals are confined or maintained shall at all times be kept and maintained in a proper, clean and sanitary condition so they are kept free from offensive odors which would disturb any person residing within a reasonable distance of the premises. The animals themselves shall be restrained in such a fashion that they shall not disturb such persons by making noise. An animal may be restrained by using a tethering device as defined in section 6-21, but such tethering area must also be maintained in a proper clean and sanitary condition, and the tethered animal must have access to adequate food, water and shelter while on such tether. 
                  (b)  Livestock or fowl. It shall be unlawful for any person to have, control or possess any pasture or enclosure for livestock or fowl in any fashion not authorized by the zoning ordinance of the city. 
                  (c)  Restraint. 
                  (1)  Generally. An animal owner shall restrain his animal in such a way as to prevent the animal from having access to the property of another person, without the permission of that person. An animal may leave the property of the animal owner when accompanied by the animal owner, but the animal owner must have control over the animal and must prevent the animal from having access to the property of another person without the permission of that person, or from attacking, threatening or harassing other persons. 
                  (2)  Dogs and cats. An owner of a dog, cat, or any animal shall restrain the animal in such a manner, whether by leash, fence or other appropriate enclosure (fence, pen, etc.), which will ensure that the animal is contained within the boundaries of the property owned or leased by the owner of the animal. In all residentially zoned districts (including subdivisions and mobile home parks and/or subdivisions), dogs, cats or any other animal shall be actively restrained as provided for in this section in order to prevent their leaving the property of their owner, unless the animal is under the direct supervision and control of the owner of the animal or his designee. 
                  (3)  Attack prevention. An animal owner shall restrain his animal in such a manner as to prevent the animal from attacking, threatening or harassing any person on the public right-of-way of the roads, streets, highways and sidewalks in the city. 
                  (d)  Vicious or dangerous animals. Any owner of a vicious animal shall confine it within a building or secure enclosure and not release it unless it is securely muzzled and under restraint. Any vicious animal not secured as provided in this section is declared a nuisance and may be impounded pursuant to the provisions of this article and/or confined by the department for a period of 30 days. If an action is brought in any court of competent jurisdiction concerning the attack or attempt to attack by such animal, the period of confinement may be extended until the entry of a final order of disposition in such action. Further, in any prosecution of an owner or a responsible person of any vicious animal for any violation of this article, the court may, upon conviction entered against the owner or responsible person, order that the animal be humanely destroyed. 
                  (e)  Hunting dogs. Hunting dogs in the custody of persons hunting in accordance with state game and fish department laws, rules and regulations are exempt from the mandates of this section. The owners of such dogs shall be civilly liable for any damage occasioned by the actions of their dogs. 
                  (f)  Animals in heat. Any owner or custodian shall confine any dog or cat in heat. 
                  (g)  Animals at large. It shall be unlawful for any person owning or having control of any chickens, ducks, horses, cows, goats, pigs, dogs, cats or any other type of animal, livestock, or other fowl within the city to permit them to run at large or to be a menace or nuisance to that person's neighbors or the public in general. In regard to poultry and/or fowl as referenced in this section, the same shall be confined in an enclosure, housing or pen of some sort to the extent possible.

                  Sec. 6-24. - Impoundment. 
                  Any animal at large or otherwise in violation of the provisions of this article may be impounded in the animal shelter in a humane manner, for a period of not less than three days, in accordance with the following provisions: 
                  (1)  If within that time an animal so impounded has not been reclaimed by its owner in accordance with the provisions of this article, the animal shall become the absolute property of the department, which may convey ownership of the animal to any responsible person on any conditions that the department may prescribe, or the department may humanely destroy the animal. 
                  (2)  An animal control officer may follow an animal that has been seen by that officer running at large onto private property to capture and impound the animal. No injunction, action or claim for damages may be brought against the department or its officers, agents or employees with respect to actions contemplated in this section. 
                  (3)  The department shall make a reasonable effort to notify the owner of any animal impounded in the animal shelter that the animal has been impounded, the manner by which the animal may be reclaimed, and that the animal shall become the property of the department as provided in this section. 
                  (4)  Following the impoundment of an animal found at large which has its owner's address attached to a collar, or some other indication of ownership such as an imbedded chip, the department shall use reasonable care to give the owner five days' notice of the proposed humane disposition. 
                  (5)  Notwithstanding any provision of this article to the contrary, the department may refuse to release any animal impounded in the animal shelter for rabies, contagious disease quarantine or for use as evidence in a criminal prosecution for any time period as the department may determine. 
                  (6)  Notwithstanding any provision of this article to the contrary, the department may humanely destroy any animal impounded in the animal shelter when the department reasonably believes that destruction of the animal is necessary to prevent disease, injury or overcrowding in the animal shelter, or to prevent the presence or threatened presence of contagious disease, the likelihood of danger or injury to humans or animals or any other condition. 
                  (7)  Notwithstanding any provision of this article to the contrary, the department may humanely destroy any animal impounded in the animal shelter when the animal control department reasonably believes the animal has sustained an injury or disease which will likely result in maiming, prolonged and/or severe suffering or death. 
                  (8)  The department may set all appropriate fees pertaining to the care and impoundment of animals. 
                  (Ord. of 10-11-2005, att.(14-54))

                  (a)  Any person who knows that an animal, domestic or wild, is rabid or suspects an animal of having rabies, or knows that an animal has been bitten by a rabid animal, shall promptly report the information, to the extent known, to the state department of human resources and the department. 
                  (b)  It shall be the duty of the owner, the health department, physicians, hospitals or any other person or agency gaining information that any domestic animal has been bitten or is probably infected with rabies, to impound the animal in the facility of a competent veterinarian within the county, where the animal shall be held for observation for any period of time as may be reasonably necessary to determine whether or not the animal is infected with rabies. 
                  (Ord. of 10-11-2005, att.(14-55)) 
                  Sec. 6-26. - Adoption. 
                  The department may convey ownership (permit adoption) of any animal which has become the property of the department to a responsible person subject to conditions prescribed by the department, including, but not limited to, the following: 
                  (1)  Payment of an adoption fee to be set by the department and any vaccination, licensing or veterinary costs; 
                  (2)  Evidence that the animal has been, or will be, examined by a veterinarian and vaccinations against rabies and other disease administered; and 
                  (3)  Evidence that the animal has been, or will be, neutered or spayed.

                  (Ord. No. 2018-001, § III, 4-10-2018) 
                  Sec. 14-22. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(2) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsection (c)(15) through (17) of this section, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq., for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia," published by the state soil and water conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in subsections (c)(16) and (17) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of article 5, chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines; 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-2, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (17)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with O.C.G.A. title 12, chapter 5, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970," and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade stormwater detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this subsection, the term "maintenance" shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. The term "maintenance" does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and the term "serviceable" shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat. 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015, if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "Minor Buffer Impact," as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq., shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 2018-001, § IV, 4-10-2018) 
                  Sec. 14-23. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from county community development to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD, if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to county community development and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 14-22(b) and (c) will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land-disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 14-22(c)(15) through (17) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6) of this section, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 14-22(b) and (c), or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures, including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary, and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 14-22(c)(15) through (17) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(6) of this section are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons, and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
                  (Ord. No. 2018-001, § V, 4-10-2018) 
                  Sec. 14-24. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  County community development will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)  County community development shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The district or the commission, or both, shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission, or both, may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  (a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  (b)  Stop-work orders. 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning. 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order. 
                  (3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  (4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop-work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his designee. All such stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop-work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 14-23(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any city Charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose a penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article under county ordinances approved under this article shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

                  DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

                  Sec. 16-34. - Authorization. 
                  Article IX, section II of the constitution of the state and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city does ordain the following. 
                  (Ord. No. 07-005, art. 1, § A, 9-11-2007) 
                  Sec. 16-35. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. No. 07-005, art. 1, § B, 9-11-2007) 
                  Sec. 16-36. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the lowest floor criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area. 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters. 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  Sec. 16-117. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 16-116(4). All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 16-86(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: 
                  1.  Individual lots or parcels; 
                  2.  In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions; 
                  3.  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or 
                  4.  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood; 
                  must have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Reference section 16-116(6).) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (3)c of this section. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 16-39 are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted, however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection (4)a of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division.

                  Sec. 16-118. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 16-39, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 16-39, the administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this division. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the provisions in subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall apply: 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (Note: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 16-116(4). 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  b.  The administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.

                  Areas of special flood hazard established in section 16-39 may include designated AO shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 16-116(4). The administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in section 16-85(1)c and (2). 
                  (3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.

                  Sec. 16-140. - Variances. 
                  (a)  The administrator as established by the city shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
                  (b)  The administrator shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the city clerk in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the administrator may appeal such decision to the superior court of the county, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the administrator shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this section and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances. 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The city clerk shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the administrator may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  Elevated building means a non-basement building built to have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns, piers, or shear walls adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a base flood event. 
                  Existing construction means any structure for which the start of construction commenced before August 14, 1986. 
                  Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before August 14, 1986. 
                  Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads. 
                  Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
                  (1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or 
                  (2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
                  Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Insurance Administration, where the boundaries of areas of special flood hazard have been defined as Zone A.

                  Floodplain means any land area susceptible to flooding. 
                  Floodproofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. The term "freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is:

                  a.  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
                  b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this Code. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. Mean sea level is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of this article, the term "mean sea level" is synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD). 
                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD), as corrected in 1929, is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain.

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: Accessory structures are not exempt from any article requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement. 
                  (1)  The term "substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the start of construction of the improvement. Note: The market value of the structure should be: 
                  a.  The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or 
                  b.  In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. 
                  This term "substantial improvement" includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  (2)  For the purposes of this definition, the term "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include:

                  Half street means a portion of the ultimate width of a road or street where the remaining portion of the road or street shall be provided at a future date. 
                  Homeowners' association means an organization formed for the maintenance and operation of the common areas of a development, where membership in the association is automatic with the purchase of a dwelling unit or lot within the development, with the ability to legally assess each owner of a dwelling unit or lot and which has authority to place a lien against all dwelling units and lots within the development.

                  Pedestrian way means a public right-of-way or private easement across a block or within a block to provide access for pedestrians and which may, in addition to providing pedestrian access, be used for the installation of utility lines. 
                  Performance bond means a type of subdivision improvement guarantee in the form of a bond, secured by the subdivider from a bonding company, in an amount specified by the city engineer to cover the costs of required improvements, and payable to the city. The city may call in the performance bond in the event the subdivider defaults on required improvements. 
                  Person means a natural human being, estate, association, firm, partnership, corporation, or other legal entity. 
                  Preliminary plat means a tentative drawing or map of a proposed subdivision. A preliminary plat is the basis for the approval or disapproval of the general layout of a land subdivision. 
                  Planned unit development means a form of development usually characterized by a unified site design for a number of housing units, clustered buildings, common open space, and a mix of building types and land uses in a slightly more dense setting than allowable on separate zoned lots.

                  Professional surveyor means a surveyor duly registered or otherwise authorized by the state to practice in the field of land surveying. 
                  Protective covenants means contracts made between private parties as to the manner in which land may be used, with the view toward protecting and preserving the physical and economic integrity of any given area. 
                  Recreation, active, means leisure activities that are facility oriented, such as swimming pools, tennis courts, and ball fields. 
                  Recreation, passive, means leisure activities that are natural resource oriented, such as hiking trails, conservation areas, and nature preserves. 
                  Reservation means a method of holding land for future public use by showing proposed public areas on a subdivision plat. 
                  Reserve strip means a strip of land across the end of, or along the edge of, a street, alley, or lot for the purpose of controlling access which is reserved or held until future street extension or widening.

The site plan is the basis for the approval or disapproval of the general layout of a development in the case of a multiple-family residential, institutional, office, commercial, or industrial development. 
                  Slope means the degree of deviation of a surface from the horizontal, usually expressed in percent or degree; the ratio of the difference in elevation between two points on the ground, and the horizontal distance between these two points. For purposes of determining steep slopes, slopes shall be measured between two points on the ground separated by 500 feet or more. 
                  Steep slopes means lands with slopes of at least 35 percent, as indicated in the comprehensive plan of the city, or which can be calculated with aid of a United States Geological Survey 1:24,000, 7.5-minute quadrangle topographic map or other available topographic information. 
                  Street means any vehicular way, other than an alley, that: 
                  (1)  Is an existing federal, state, county or municipal roadway; 
                  (2)  Is constructed as shown upon a plat approved pursuant to law and is open to vehicle travel;

                  (4)  Is constructed and open to vehicle travel and shown on a plat duly filed and recorded in the clerk's office of the county superior court prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. Land between the street lines, whether improved or unimproved, shall be considered part of the street. 
                  Street, collector, unless otherwise defined by the comprehensive plan, means a public street whose function is to collect traffic from neighborhoods and local streets and which connects to another public street of equal of greater classification. A collector street also may provide direct access to adjacent properties. 
                  Street, local, unless otherwise defined in the comprehensive plan, means any public street, except an alley, collector street, or arterial street, and which has a primary function to provide direct access to adjoining properties and which serves a limited area only, usually a single land subdivision. 
                  Street, major arterial, unless otherwise defined by the comprehensive plan, means a street connecting two or more towns or communities, connecting two highways of equal or greater capacity, or serving as the primary access to a large land area. A major arterial may also serve a large traffic generator (e.g., an industrial area) and perform a secondary function of providing local access. 
                  Street, marginal access, means a residential street parallel and adjacent to a major thoroughfare and which provides access to abutting properties with protection from through-traffic. 
                  Street, private, means a road or street that has not been accepted for maintenance by the city and that is not owned and maintained by a state, county, city, or another public entity. 
                  Subdivider means any person, as defined by this section, who undertakes the subdivision of land, and any person having such a proprietary interest in land to be subdivided as will authorize the maintenance of proceedings to subdivide such land under this chapter, or the authorized agent of such person. 
                  Subdivision means a division of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots, building sites, or other divisions for the purpose of sale or building development, whether immediate or future, including all division of land involving the dedication of a new street or a change in existing streets. The term "subdivision" includes re-subdivision and, when appropriate to the context, relates either to the process of subdividing or to the actual land or area which is subdivided. 
                  Subdivision, minor, means a subdivision of four or fewer lots, which does not involve the construction of a new public or private street. Because minor subdivisions do not involve the construction of a new public or private street, they are processed administratively by the director as final plat applications that do not require preliminary plat approval. Any improvements to an existing public street abutting the tract proposed for minor subdivision, or the installation of utilities along said existing public road, as may be required to comply with this chapter, shall be done according to plans and permit requirements of this chapter, but said requirements shall not subject the minor subdivision to the requirements for a major subdivision as specified in this chapter. 
                  Subdivision, major, means the division of a tract or parcel of land into four or more lots which may or may not involve the construction of a new public or private street; or any subdivision that involves the construction of a new public or private street. Because major subdivisions involve construction of a new public or private street or the upgrade of an existing private access way to city standards, construction plans and land disturbance permits are required, and major subdivisions are therefore processed in multiple steps, including preliminary plat approval (unless specifically exempted), approval of construction plans and issuance of land disturbance permits, and final plat approval. 
                  Utility means public or private water or sewer piping systems, water or sewer pumping stations, electric power lines, fuel or gas pipelines, telephone lines, roads, cable telephone lines, fiber optic cables, driveways, bridges, river/lake access facilities, stormwater systems and drainage ways, and railroads or other utilities identified by the city. As appropriate to the context, the term "utility" may also include all persons, companies, or governmental agencies supplying the same. 
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the strict requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this Code; a minimal relaxation or modification of the strict terms of this chapter as applied to specific property when, because of particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical condition of the property, compliance would result in practical difficulty; or a grant of relief from the strict requirements of this chapter due to a proposed project not being able to meet policies and objectives specifically identified in the comprehensive plan.

                  Sec. 26-5. - Applicability and general provisions. 
                  (a)  Applicability. These regulations shall apply to all real property within corporate limits of the city. 
                  (b)  Land is one tract until subdivided. Until property proposed for subdivision has received final plat approval and been properly recorded, the land involving the subdivision shall be considered as one tract, or as otherwise legally recorded. 
                  (c)  All land subdivisions to comply. No person shall sell, advertise, or offer to sell, by deed, map, plat or other instrument, any parcel of land not subdivided under the requirements of this chapter. It shall be unlawful for any person to transfer or sell land by reference to, or by exhibition of, or by other use of, a plat of a land subdivision that has not been approved and recorded in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. The description of such land by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer shall not exempt the transaction. No plat of land subdivision shall be entitled to be recorded in the office of the clerk of the superior court of the county, and it shall be unlawful to record such a plat of land subdivision, unless and until it shall have been approved in accordance with the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (d)  Preliminary plat and plans required prior to construction. No person shall commence construction of any improvements on any lot prior to the approval of a preliminary plat, if required by this chapter, nor prior to approval of construction plans and engineering plans for said improvements as required by this chapter. 
                  (e)  Building and other permits. No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for a building, structure, or use, nor shall any excavation, grading, or land disturbance applications be approved, on any parcel of land regulated by this chapter that has not been approved in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
                  (f)  Public streets and lands. No land dedicated as a public street or for other public purpose shall be opened, extended, or accepted as a public street or for other public land unless such improvements are constructed in accordance with the specifications of this chapter and said land and/or improvements are formally approved and accepted as public improvements by the mayor and city council in accordance with procedures established in this chapter. 
                  (g)  Appeals. Any person aggrieved by an interpretation or decision of the director, city engineer, or other official responsible for the administration of this chapter may file an appeal to the mayor and city council.

                  Sec. 26-6. - Exemptions from plat approval. 
                  The following types of land subdivisions, transfers, and sales are specifically exempted from the plat approval requirements of this chapter: 
                  (1)  The creation and sale of cemetery plots. 
                  (2)  The sale of lots consistent with previously-approved and recorded plats or deeds. 
                  (3)  The creation of leaseholds for space within a multiple-occupancy building or the division of property into leaseholds for commercial, industrial, or institutional use. 
                  (4)  The creation of leaseholds for the agricultural use of property where the use does not involve the construction of a building to be used as a residence or for other purposes not directly related to agricultural use of the land or crops or livestock raised thereon. 
                  (5)  Any division of land to heirs through a judicial estate proceeding, or any division of land pursuant to a judicial partition, or any division of land occurring from the foreclosure of a deed of trust; provided, however, that such exemption shall not require the city to issue permits if the resulting lots or parcels fail to meet any applicable regulations of the local jurisdiction concerning lot size, lot width, and other dimensional requirements. 
                  (Res. of 10-12-2004(2), § 2-2-6) 
                  Sec. 26-7. - Lot combinations. 
                  An existing lot line forming the boundary between two conforming platted lots located within the same subdivision or a lot line between lots or parcels that have merged to form one building lot may be removed or eliminated through a final plat revision process which conforms to the requirements of this chapter. In the case no final plat applies to the subject lots or parcels, a boundary survey and plat depicting all lots involved in the lot combination shall be required to be approved by the director and recorded as a final plat. Such combination plat shall be titled with the same name as that of the original subdivision, if applicable, and shall indicate thereon that the replat is for the purpose of removing the lot lines between specific lots. (See Figure 26-7.1.) 

                  (Res. of 10-12-2004(2), § 2-2-7) 
                  Sec. 26-8. - Boundary line adjustments. 
                  One or more existing lot lines forming boundaries between conforming platted lots located within the same subdivision, or one or more lot lines between abutting lots or parcels may be adjusted through a final plat revision process that requires the approval of the director and recording of a plat meeting the specifications of a final plat. In the case no final plat applies to the subject lots or parcels, a boundary survey and plat of the entire lots involved in the boundary line adjustment shall be required to be approved by the director and recorded. Such plat showing said boundary line adjustment shall be titled with the same name as that of the original subdivision and shall include thereon that the replat is for the purpose of adjusting the lot lines between specific lots. (See Figure 26-8.1.) 

                  (Res. of 10-12-2004(2), § 2-2-8) 
                  Sec. 26-9. - Design requirements for blocks. 
                  (a)  Block length. Intersecting streets shall be provided at such intervals so as to provide adequate cross traffic. Blocks in residential subdivisions should not exceed 1,800 feet, nor be less than 600 feet in length, except where topography or other conditions justify a departure from these standards. The planning commission may require pedestrian ways and/or easements through the block be located near the center in blocks longer than 800 feet. 
                  (b)  Block width. The width of the block shall normally be sufficient to allow two tiers of lots of appropriate depth. Blocks intended for business or industrial use shall be of such width as to be considered most suitable for their respective use, including adequate space for off-street parking and deliveries. (See Figure 26-9.1.) 

                  (Res. of 10-12-2004(2), § 2-2-9) 
                  Sec. 26-10. - Design requirements for lots. 
                  (a)  Natural features and assets. In the subdividing of land, due regard shall be shown for all natural features, such as tree growth, watercourses, historic sites or similar conditions which, if preserved, will add attractiveness to the proposed development and safety from hazards. 
                  (b)  Access and minimum lot frontage. Each lot shall have access to a public street and a minimum of 50 feet of lot frontage on a public street; provided, however, that the local governing body may permit one or more lots to be accessed by private streets, as more fully specified in section 34-4; provided, further, that in the case of a lot accessed by a circular cul-de-sac, the minimum lot frontage may be reduced to 30 feet. 
                  (c)  Adequate buildable area required. Land subject to flooding, improper drainage or erosion, or that is unsuitable for residential or other use for topographical or other reasons, shall not be platted for residential use, nor for any other use that will continue or increase the danger to health, safety, or of property destruction, unless the hazards can be and are corrected. Each lot shall contain an adequate building site not subject to flooding and outside the limits of any existing easements or building setback lines required by the local governing body. (See Figure 26-10.1.) 

                  (d)  Lot remnants not permitted. All remnants of lots below any required minimum lot size that may be required, left over after subdividing of a larger tract, must be added to adjacent lots, rather than allowed to remain as unusable parcels. The director may permit a lot remnant for a specific purpose such as a detention pond, provided that access and design is appropriate and the lot remnant is restricted to specific non-building use. 
                  (e)  Service areas. Commercial and industrial lots shall be adequate to provide service areas and off-street parking suitable to the use intended. 
                  (f)  Lot area. The minimum lot area shall not be less than that established by the land use intensity district in which the subdivision is located, if applicable. 
                  (g)  Lot width. No portion of a lot shall be narrower than 125 feet, with the exception of cul-de-sac lots, nor shall any lot have a lot width less than that established by the land use intensity district in which the subdivision is located, if applicable. 
                  (h)  Lot depth. Lots shall have a depth of not less than 360 feet, unless circumstances make these limitations impracticable. 
                  (i)  Flag lots. No lot shall be approved which constitutes a flag lot except with special approval from the planning commission due to extreme topographic circumstances. 
                  (j)  Side lot lines. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines. 
                  (k)  Corner lots. Corner lots shall have adequate width to meet the front building setback requirements, if applicable, from all rights-of-way. 
                  (l)  Double frontage lots. Double frontage or through lots should be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from arterials or overcome specific disadvantages of topography or orientation. Double frontage lots with frontage on a major arterial street shall have additional depth in order to allow space for screen planting along the lot line abutting a major arterial street. 
                  (Res. of 10-12-2004(2), § 2-2-10) 
                  Sec. 26-11. - Easements. 
                  Where a watercourse, drainage way, channel or stream traverses a subdivision, there shall be provided a stormwater or drainage easement of adequate width. Easements shall be provided for all drainage facilities as approved by the city engineer. Where easements are needed for utility locations, the subdivider shall provide them to the appropriate utility provider. Where easements are needed for public water and/or sanitary sewer lines, they shall be provided as determined appropriate by the city engineer. All easements required pursuant to this section shall be shown on the preliminary plat, if required, and final plat.

                  Sec. 26-12. - Survey monuments for all lots required. 
                  For all subdivisions, a state registered land surveyor shall install permanent survey monuments at all property corners and land lot lines, prior to final plat approval. Lot corners shall be marked with metal rods not less than one-half inch in diameter and 18 inches in length and driven so as to be stabilized in the ground. Permanent survey monuments shall also be installed in accordance with the most recent edition of section 180-7-.05, Monument, of the Rules of State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors and the Georgia Plat Act, O.C.G.A. § 15-6-67. 
                  (Res. of 10-12-2004(2), § 2-2-12) 
                  Sec. 26-13. - Preliminary plat. 
                  (a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to ensure compliance with the basic design concepts and improvement requirements of subdivisions and land developments through the submittal of a tentative map of all major subdivisions for review and approval by the planning commission. 
                  (b)  When required. All major subdivisions, and any subdivision involving the dedication of a public street, shall require the submission of a preliminary plat to the director for review and approval by the planning commission. Prior to the issuance of any permit for land disturbance, or the installation of any improvements, the planning commission must approve the preliminary plat, if required. 
                  (c)  Preliminary plat application and specifications. Preliminary plat applications shall be made in accordance with requirements shown in Table 26-15.1, and preliminary plats shall meet the minimum plat specifications shown in Table 26-15.2. 
                  (d)  Procedures. Upon receipt of a completed preliminary plat application, the director shall schedule the application for the next public meeting before the planning commission and forward all pertinent materials in the application to the planning commission for review. An application for preliminary plat approval must be submitted as least 14 days before the regular meeting date of the planning commission to be considered on that agenda. The planning commission shall have 32 days from the date the public meeting is held to approve, conditionally approve, or deny the preliminary plat application. The basis of the planning commission's review of and action on a preliminary plat shall be whether the preliminary plat meets the purposes and requirements of this chapter, and all other ordinances that relate to the proposed development. 
                  (e)  Disposition. Approval of a preliminary plat shall be valid for a period of one year, after which time a complete construction plans application must be submitted. If a completed application for construction plans is not submitted during that time, preliminary plat approval shall expire and be null and void. 
                  (f)  Appeal. Denial of preliminary plat approval may be appealed to the mayor and city council. 
                  (g)  Amendments to approved preliminary plats. The director is authorized to approve minor amendments to preliminary plats. Any proposed amendment to a sketch plat that is determined by the director to constitute a public interest shall be deemed a major amendment. For all amendments to preliminary plats determined to be major amendments, planning commission approval shall be required. The planning commission shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny the proposed major amendment to a preliminary plat. Procedures for considering a major amendment to a preliminary plat shall be the same as required for an initial application for preliminary plat approval. 
                  (Res. of 10-12-2004(2), § 2-2-13) 
                  Sec. 26-14. - Construction plans. 
                  (a)  Application. Upon approval of a preliminary plat, the subdivider or land developer may apply for construction plan approval. In the case of a minor subdivision, or in cases where a preliminary plat is not required by this chapter, the subdivider or land developer may apply for approval of construction plans; provided, however, that in the case of a minor subdivision or land development the applicant for construction plan approval should hold a pre-application conference with the director to ensure that plans meet the intent and specific provisions of this chapter and other applicable regulations. The construction plan approval process is administrative. Applications for construction plan approval shall be made in accordance with requirements shown in Table 26-15.1 and Table 26-15.2. No application for construction plans shall be accepted for processing nor approved by the director until a preliminary plat, if required, has been approved by the planning commission and the proposed construction plans are found by the director to be in substantial conformity with said approval and any conditions of such approval. 
                  (b)  Director's decision criteria. The only basis upon which the director may deny a construction plan is the failure of the application to meet the requirements of this chapter or any other applicable local regulations or the failure of the construction plans and application to meet the requirements of preliminary plat approval specified by the planning commission. 
                  (c)  Certificate of approval. All copies of the construction plans shall be noted by inscription on the plat noting such approval by the director and the city engineer. Construction plan approval shall expire and be null and void after a period of one year, unless activity toward improvements on the land has been initiated, or unless the director approves an extension of time.

                  Sec. 26-16. - Dedications of streets and public lands. 
                  Subdivision streets and rights-of-way and other lands to be dedicated to the public shall be accepted and dedicated by the city only upon the delivery to the mayor and city council of the general warranty deed conveying fee simple title of such rights-of-way and lands. The warranty deed shall be accompanied by an attorney's certificate of title and a tax transfer form addressed to the mayor and city council certifying that the grantor in such deed is vested with marketable fee simple title to the property conveyed thereby, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, and further that the individual executing such deed has full authority to do so. Acceptance of such dedication shall be accomplished by resolution of the mayor and city council, a certified copy of which shall be attached to both the deed of dedication and the final plat.

                  Sec. 26-17. - Subdivision improvement guarantees. 
                  In order to protect the city and prospective purchasers of and residents in a subdivision, the subdivider/developer shall provide to the city financial security to guarantee the installation of public improvements. The subdivider or developer financial guarantee shall be in the form of a performance bond for the benefit of the city upon which the city can collect. 
                  (Res. of 10-12-2004(2), § 2-2-17) 
                  Sec. 26-18. - Limitations on minor subdivisions. 
                  (a)  Purpose. Minor subdivisions provide certain advantages, such as a shorter application process and less public scrutiny, that tend to favor their use over the filing of major subdivision applications. Given these advantages, the prospect exists that subdividers may seek to divide a parcel via consecutive and/or contiguous minor subdivisions instead of filing for a major subdivision. It is the intent of the mayor and city council to prohibit the practice of chain subdivisions where the same land owner subdivides land and then files minor subdivision applications on common contiguous parcels, which collectively total more than four lots. It is also the intent of the mayor and city council to prohibit minor subdivisions adjacent to each other within a three-year time period, in cases where part of an original tract of land is now owned by another person or entity and was transferred or sold to another owner with the apparent intent to circumvent the major subdivision process. 
                  (b)  Common contiguous parcels shown on minor subdivision plats. Contiguous common parcels, as defined by this chapter, shall be referenced on all applications for minor subdivisions, and contiguous common parcels shall be considered part of any application for minor subdivision, for purposes of determining whether or not the division of land proposed is a major subdivision or a minor subdivision. Common contiguous parcels shall not be counted as lots in the case of a minor subdivision. 
                  (c)  Limitations. Land within a minor subdivision, including all contiguous parcels owned by the subdivider, shall not be further divided for a period of three years unless a preliminary plat application is filed and approved as a major subdivision pursuant to the requirements of this chapter. If property proposed to be subdivided was part of an original tract, and if the property proposed to be subdivided abuts land that has been divided as a minor subdivision in the last three years, then minor subdivision of said property shall be prohibited. This provision shall not be construed to prohibit the approval of two contiguous minor subdivisions under separate ownership; however, this provision is intended to be construed liberally so that one property owner does not develop a minor subdivision on part of an original tract and transfer or sell another part of the original tract for the purposes of minor subdivision within a three-year period. It is the intent that land abutting a minor subdivision that was owned by the subdivider of the abutting minor subdivision shall not be subdivided as a minor subdivision for a period of three years, regardless of ownership. 
                  (Res. of 10-12-2004(2), § 2-2-18) 
                  Sec. 26-19. - Private streets. 
                  (a)  Permitted. The mayor and city council may, upon application, permit private streets within major subdivisions, subject to the requirements of this section. The mayor and city council shall approve applications for private streets at the time of preliminary plat approval recommendation by the planning commission. Following a recommendation by the planning commission to authorize private streets in a major subdivision, the mayor and city council shall consider the application and may impose conditions on the approval of private streets to ensure various public purposes and to mitigate potential problems with private streets. No final plat involving a private street shall be approved unless said final plat conforms to the requirements of this section. 
                  (b)  Engineering plans required. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to construct a new private street or alter an existing private street or to cause the same to be done without first obtaining approval of engineering and construction plans from the director and the city engineer in accordance with the requirements of this chapter and section 34-4. 
                  (c)  Standards. All private streets shall be constructed to all standards for public streets as required by section 34-4, applicable construction specifications of the city engineer, and as approved by the city engineer. 
                  (d)  Street names and signs. Private streets shall be named, subject to the approval of the director. The subdivider of land involving a private street shall install street signs with content containing the street name and the designation "private," as approved by the city engineer. The sign signifying the private street may be required by the city engineer to be a different color than that of street signs provided for public streets, in order to distinguish maintenance responsibilities in the field. 
                  (e)  Easements. Easements for private streets shall be designated on final plats as general purpose public access and utility easements, along with the name of said private street. Said easement shall, at minimum, be of the same width as that required for the right-of-way of a public street by the city engineer for the type of public street (local, collector, etc.) most closely resembling the proposed private street. Easements for private streets shall not be included in any calculation of minimum lot size or density limitations established by local land use regulations. In the cases of private streets, the general purpose public access and utility easement for the private street shall either: 
                  (1)  Be shown in a manner on the final plat such that each lot fronting the private street extends to the centerline of the private street. No lot shall be permitted to be divided by the general purpose public access and utility easement required and established for a private street; or 
                  (2)  Be drawn as its own discrete parcel to be dedicated to a private homeowners' association (i.e., not shown to be a part of any lot). 
                  (f)  Maintenance. The city shall not maintain, repair, resurface, rebuild, or otherwise improve streets, signs, drainage improvements or any other appurtenances within general purpose public access and utility easements established for private streets. A private maintenance covenant recorded with the county clerk of the superior court shall be required for any private street and other improvements within general purpose public access and utility easements established for private streets. The covenant shall set out the distribution of expenses, remedies for noncompliance with the terms of the agreement, rights to the use of easements, and other pertinent considerations. The covenant shall specifically include the following terms: 
                  (1)  The covenant shall establish minimum annual assessments in an amount adequate to defray costs of ordinary maintenance and procedures for approval of additional needed assessments. The covenant shall also specify that the funds from such assessments will be held by a homeowners' or property owners' association in cases of a subdivision of seven or more lots fronting on a private street. 
                  (2)  The covenant shall include a periodic maintenance schedule. 
                  (3)  The covenant for maintenance shall be enforceable by any property owner served by the private street. 
                  (4)  The covenant shall establish a formula for assessing maintenance and repair costs equitably to property owners served by the private street. 
                  (5)  The covenant shall run with the land. 
                  (6)  The mayor and city council may, at its discretion, as a condition of approving private streets, require a performance bond and/or maintenance bond be submitted by the subdivider and held by a homeowners' or property owners' association, or the council may require that the subdivider pay an amount of money as recommended by the city engineer into an escrow account or other suitable account for the maintenance and repair of private streets and stormwater management improvements, to be drawn from by the homeowners' or property owners' association as maintenance and repair needs may arise. 
                  (g)  Specifications for final plats involving private streets. The director shall not approve for recording any final plat involving a private street unless and until it shall contain the following on the face of the plat: 
                  (1)  Deed book and page reference to the recorded covenant required by this section; 
                  (2)  "WARNING, ____________ City of ____________ has no responsibility to build, improve, maintain, or otherwise service the private streets, drainage improvements, and other appurtenances contained within the general public purpose access and utility easement or easements for private streets shown on this plat."; 
                  (3)  "Grant of Easement. The general purpose public access and utility easement(s) shown on this plat for private street(s) is hereby granted and said grant of rights shall be liberally construed to provide all necessary authority to the City, and to public or private utility companies serving the subdivision, for the installation and maintenance of utilities, including, but not limited to, electric lines, gas lines, telephone lines, water lines, sewer lines, cable television lines, and fiber optic cables, together with the right to trim interfering trees and brush, together with a perpetual right of ingress and egress for installation, maintenance, and replacement of such lines. 
                  ____________ 
                  Signature of Property Owner"; and 
                  (4)  The following certificate of dedication shall be required, unless the mayor and city council waives the dedication requirement: 
                  "Certificate of Dedication. All water and sewer lines installed within the general purpose public access and utility easement(s) shown on this plat for private street(s) are hereby dedicated to the City of Mt. Zion. 
                  ____________ 
                  Signature of Property Owner." 
                  (h)  Requirement for purchaser's acknowledgement of private responsibilities. Prior to the sale or as a condition of the closing of a real estate transaction involving any lot served by a private street in the city, the subdivider or seller of said lot shall execute a notarized purchaser's acknowledgement of private street construction and drainage maintenance responsibilities as set forth below. A copy of the purchaser's acknowledgement shall be retained by the purchaser and shall be required to be submitted as a condition of a building permit for a principal building on said lot. 
                  "Purchaser's Acknowledgement of Private Street and Drainage Maintenance Responsibility 
                  (I)/(We) have read the Declaration of Covenant which pertains to the lot that is the subject of this real estate transaction ____________ (insert address or attach legal description). (I)/(We) understand that the Declaration of Covenant applies to the lot that (I am)/(we are) purchasing and requires (me)/(us) to provide a specified percentage or amount of the financing for the construction and maintenance of any private street and drainage facilities serving the lot which (I am)/(we are) purchasing, and that owners of other lots in this plat may sue for and recover those costs which this covenant requires (me)/(us) to pay, plus their damages resulting from (my)/(our) refusal to contribute, plus reasonable attorney's fees. (I)/(We) further understand that the City has no obligation to assist with the maintenance and improvement of the private street, drainage facilities, and other appurtenances within the general purpose public access and utility easement for the private road serving the lot in question. (I)/(We) understand that a copy of this purchaser's acknowledgement shall be required as a condition of the issuance of a building permit for a principal building on the lot (I am)/(we are) purchasing.

Prior to adoption of said millage rate, the governing body shall publish the notice of proposed ad valorem tax rate as required by O.C.G.A. § 48-5-32. Millage rates shall be calculated using 40 percent of the assessed fair market value of the property upon which the tax is levied. 
                  (d)  The city clerk or the city's designee shall cause a bill to be sent to all taxpayers at the address last shown on the county tax digest by regular U.S. mail, with adequate postage thereon; provided, however, failure by the taxpayer to receive a bill shall not constitute grounds for nonpayment or late payment of the tax. The bill shall state the location or description of the property (100 percent) and its taxable value due thereon. The bill shall also state the due date after which taxes shall be in default. The bill may also contain such additional information as allowed by law or authorized by the mayor and council.

                  (b)  Upon the failure of any customer or other responsible party to pay any bill, assessment, fee, penalty, or charge for water and/or garbage services for any premises for which that party is responsible, the city is authorized, through its designated agents, servants, and/or employees, to turn off and discontinue water and/or garbage service to the property location for such nonpayment. Failure to receive a bill does not relieve the customer of responsibility for all applicable charges for water and/or garbage service incurred or imposed pursuant to these policies. The city shall not be required to resume the supply of water and/or garbage service to the property until all past due charges, including any applicable late fees, fines, penalties, or other charges, are fully paid.

                  (e)  The city shall be entitled to impose, transfer, or consolidate any outstanding balance due on one account to any other account in the name of or owned by the same person, entity, corporation, principal, or any legal successor thereto. 
                  (f)  The city requests that the customer be present at the location when service is turned on to prevent the possibility of any internal/external damage. The customer assumes all responsibility for water damage, if any, when service commences.

                  (4)  Water service may be discontinued without notice if payment has not been received by the due date. 
                  (f)  Customers may elect to make payment by selected major credit card. If using a credit or debit card, a user fee will be added. 
                  (g)  Customers having a history of checks or automatic drafts returned to the city water department due to insufficient funds (NSF) may be required to pay in cash. 
                  (h)  A charge will be levied when a check is presented against an account with insufficient funds or when a stop-payment has been applied.

                  (b)  Water to premises, if turned off by the city, shall only be restored by the city. Anyone restoring water service to a property without the express written consent or under the direction of the city shall subject the customer and/or owner to those surcharges and fines prescribed in section 32-32.

                  (a)  The city water department understands that from time to time water leaks occur, and though the customer did not get beneficial use of the lost water, the city did incur the expense of purchasing and distributing it. 
                  (b)  Customers experiencing a water leak that can prove the leak was repaired within one month may receive a water leak adjustment. Proof of repairs shall be in the form of a paid invoice from a plumber or other verifiable documentation. Water leak adjustments are limited to one every two calendar years per customer. In the event the customer knew of the leak and allowed it to leak beyond one month, no adjustment will be made. In the instance where the customer was unaware of the leak and it leaked beyond one month, the adjustment may be made using the water leak adjustment calculation at the discretion of the billing clerk. 
                  (c)  The water leak adjustment policy is not applicable to water leaks that cause serious detriment to the city water department.

                  Customers with a history of two or more late payments, disconnections, NSF checks, and/or delinquent notices in a six-month period of time may be required to post an additional security deposit so the amount of deposit held by the city is sufficient to cover the utility bills incurred by the customer in an average month peak period of time. The additional deposit required may be added to the bill for collection. If service has been disconnected, the additional deposit must be paid to the city prior to the restoration of service.

                  When, upon examination, meters fail to register or the accuracy does not meet the requirements of the city water department, the account will be examined for a period of one year preceding the removal.

                  Sec. 34-2. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum standards for the use of land and improvements in the city. The zoning regulations and districts herein established are designed to: 
                  (1)  Lessen congestion in the streets;

                  Sec. 34-3. - Minimum requirements. 
                  The requirements of these regulations are minimum permissible standards; and it is expected that developers and the respective decision-making authority will normally strive for quality developments that will exceed these minimum requirements.

                  Sec. 34-4. - Comprehensive plan is official policy concerning land use. 
                  The comprehensive plan adopted by resolution of the city council is established as the official policy of the city concerning land uses. The incorporated areas of the city are divided into land use categories consistent with the future land use plan in the land use element of the comprehensive plan. The comprehensive plan does not alter or affect the existing zoning districts in the city, does not effectuate an amendment to the official zoning maps, and does not in itself permit or prohibit any existing land uses. The land use element of the comprehensive plan shall be updated on an as needed basis to reflect changes in land use and to discover any inconsistencies zoning changes have caused in the future land use map. 
                  (Res. of 10-12-2004(3), § 2.3)

                  The land use element of the comprehensive plan shall be updated as needed or as required by law. This update shall be used to identify current uses of land, emerging growth patterns and any significant change in land use policy as identified by the future land use map of the comprehensive plan. This update shall also be used as policy in the city's consideration of proposed amendments to the zoning map or text of this chapter. All amendments to the city's comprehensive plan shall be in accordance with the minimum planning standards and procedures of the Georgia Planning Act.

                  Arterial streets are intended to provide higher travel speeds between or within communities or to and from collectors and expressways. Access is controlled so that only community-significant land use may have direct access to these streets. 
                  Collector streets connect residential streets to the highway system's major and higher (minor) arterials to provide access to nonresidential uses and arterials. Collectors form barriers between neighborhoods and are designed for higher speeds and traffic volumes than are residential streets. Because non-congested traffic flow is necessary for their effective functioning, residential uses are prohibited access to collectors. Collectors are classified as major collectors and minor collectors. 
                  Major collector. The primary function is to carry traffic for most major intra-urban trips over one mile, particularly during peak hours. These streets provide only limited direct access to adjacent land. This direct access is usually focused on major facilities, shopping centers or other significant traffic generators. Major collectors are usually designed with four travel lanes and may be either divided or undivided. On-street parking cannot be permitted. 
                  Minor collector. The primary function is to carry traffic for short to medium (one-half to one mile) intra-urban trips and serves primarily local traffic.

                  Sec. 34-196. - Table 34-196.1. 
                  A buffer shall be required whenever two adjoining properties are in dissimilar zone districts as shown in the following table: 
                  Table 34-196.1. Buffer Requirements Between Dissimilar Zone Districts 

                   
                  (Res. of 10-12-2004(3), art. 8, intro. ¶) 
                  Sec. 34-197. - Determination of buffer requirements between residential, commercial and industrial zones. 
                  When two adjoining properties are dissimilar residential, commercial or industrial zone districts as indicated in Table 34-196.1, the property within the zone district allowing the most intensive uses is required to provide the buffer when acquiring a building permit unless the buffer was pre-existing. When two adjoining vacant parcels are in dissimilar zone districts as indicated in Table 34-196.1, no buffer is required when the parcel zoned for the less intensive use acquires a building permit. 
                  (1)  Buffer requirement. The required buffer shall consist of plantings or a fence, wall (not otherwise part of a structure or accessory structure), or berm, which meets the screening standards of section 34-198. If plantings are chosen as the method of screening, the planting area shall have a minimum base width of 12 feet. 
                  (2)  Buffer requirement. The required buffer shall consist of a 50-foot setback from the adjoining property line containing not less than a 20-foot base width consisting of plantings, plus a fence, wall (not otherwise part of a structure or accessory structure), berm, or any combination thereof, which meets the screening standards of section 34-198. 
                  (3)  Buffer requirement. The required buffer shall consist of a 100-foot setback from the adjoining property line containing not less than a 20-foot base width consisting of plantings, plus a fence, wall (not otherwise part of a structure or accessory structure), berm, or any combination thereof, which meets the screening standards of section 34-198. 
                  (4)  Buffer requirement. The required buffer shall consist of either an unvegetated 500-foot setback or 200-foot vegetated setback from the adjoining property line. A 200-foot minimum setback shall consist of 75 feet of vegetated buffer area, measured along the entire portion of the property line abutting said use, and such buffer shall extend an additional 100 feet in each direction along the common property line. The 75-foot vegetated buffer shall meet the screening requirements contained in section 34-198. 
                  (Res. of 10-12-2004(3), § 8.1) 
                  Sec. 34-198. - Screening standards. 
                  Screening is a method of visually shielding or obscuring one use from another by a fence, wall, berm or densely planted vegetation. 
                  (1)  Plantings. 
                  a.  Plantings shall consist of either trees or shrubs or any combination of both. Planted areas shall be located along the abutting property lines or in areas that will provide the best screening effectiveness. 
                  b.  If trees or large shrubs are used solely as the screening device, they shall be any evergreen species from the list provided by the city clerk, which, under normal growing conditions, will attain a minimum height of eight feet and a canopy spread of ten feet within four years. They shall be planted a minimum 20 feet on center. 
                  c.  If trees are used in combination with shrubs, they may be of any species from the list provided by the city clerk. Small trees shall be planted 30 feet on center, and large trees 40 feet on center as shown in the following illustration. Shrubs shall be any evergreen species from the list provided by the city clerk planted four feet on center as shown in the following illustration. Shrubs shall initially be of any size which would normally attain a minimum height of six feet within three years after planting. 

                  (2)  Walls. Walls shall be of masonry construction and a minimum height of eight feet. The wall shall be placed on the edge of the buffer nearest the most intensive land use. 
                  (3)  Fences. Fences shall be a minimum of eight feet in height and constructed of standard wood fencing materials and methods or chainlink with woven inserts that will provide 90 percent visual blockage as shown in the examples provided by the zoning administrator. The fence shall be placed on the edge of the buffer nearest the most intense land use. 
                  (4)  Berms. Earthen berms shall have a minimum height of eight feet.

                  Sec. 34-199. - Buffer design. 
                  All buffers required by this article shall conform to the following specifications: 
                  (1)  Prior to development, a buffer plan shall be required to show the types and locations of all plantings within a required buffer. If a site plan is required, a buffer plan shall be incorporated as part of the site development plan. 
                  (2)  Landscaping within buffer areas shall be used to screen objectionable views or nuisances, such as parking and service areas, refuse containers, air conditioning units and transformers. 
                  (3)  Existing on-site trees may be credited as meeting the requirements of this article if the zoning administrator determines that such plant materials achieve the purposes of this article.

                  Sec. 34-200. - Location of buffers. 
                  Buffers shall be located on the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel along all lot lines adjoining dissimilar zones including adjacent property lines, which may be separated by an existing or proposed public right-of-way. Buffers shall not be located on any portion of existing, dedicated or reserved public or private street rights-of-way.

                  The requirements of this article may be waived by the city planning commission under any of the following conditions: 
                  (1)  If it is clearly demonstrated that the existing topography and/or vegetation will achieve the purpose of this article. 
                  (2)  If it is clearly demonstrated that, for topographic reasons, no required screening device could possibly screen the ground level activities of the use from the first floor view of the residential structure abutting the use. 
                  (3)  The adjoining property owners mutually agree in writing that the required buffer is not necessary for a satisfactory use and enjoyment of their property rights. 
                  (4)  It is clearly demonstrated that an existing or proposed public right-of-way separation between adjoining properties will achieve the purposes of this article.

                  Sec. 34-202. - Use of buffers. 
                  A buffer may be used for some forms of passive recreation such as pedestrian, bike, equestrian trails, or as a stormwater retention area provided that: 
                  (1)  No planted materials shall be eliminated; and 
                  (2)  The total width of the required buffer area shall be maintained.

                  Sec. 34-203. - Maintenance. 
                  The responsibility for maintenance of buffers shall remain with the owner of the property. Any required plant that has died shall be replaced. Maintenance of planted areas shall consist of mowing, removal of litter and dead plant materials and necessary pruning. Fences and walls shall be kept in a condition that meets the requirements of this article.

                  Sec. 34-205. - Surety for buffer installation. 
                  When the date for issuing a certificate of occupancy does not coincide with the planting conditions that are necessary to install a required buffer, the city clerk shall accept a letter of credit or other acceptable surety for the buffer installation. Such surety shall be in the amount and form satisfactory to the city clerk and shall certify the following: 
                  (1)  That the creditor does guarantee funds in an amount to cover the cost of installing all buffers as estimated and approved by the building inspector; 
                  (2)  That in case of failure of the developer to complete the specified improvements, the creditor shall pay the government immediately, and without further action, such funds as are necessary to finance the completion of those improvements up to the limit of the secured credit; and 
                  (3)  That the letter of credit or other surety may not be withdrawn or reduced in amount until released by the building inspector after final inspection and certification of approval of the buffer.

                  ARTICLE VI. - SIGNS 

                  Sec. 34-234. - Purpose. 
                  (a)  Sign regulations achieve public safety rationales not achieved by standard building code provisions. Without sign regulations, signs can pose a clear danger to public safety. It has long been recognized that sign controls are needed to promote traffic safety and avoid traffic accidents. Signs can distract motorists by impairing visibility. Traffic safety is improved by restricting the size, height, and location of signs. Signs, if unregulated, can confuse motorists by mimicking traffic safety signals and signs. 
                  (b)  Unregulated signs may negatively affect the character of communities and the value of buildings. For example, blighted signs and antiquated signs and sign structures (i.e., the pole with a blank structure for a sign face) can contribute to an overall image of blight and a reduction of property values in declining areas if not addressed and removed via sign controls. Unregulated signs can reduce the effectiveness of signs needed to direct the public because they compete with public purpose signs and reduce their visibility and effectiveness. Unregulated signage in special character areas, such as the downtown, would almost assuredly neutralize any public plans and investments to improve streetscapes. 
                  (c)  This article is adopted to serve substantial governmental interests by correcting and avoiding multiple problems that would occur without the regulation of signs. The regulations contained herein are no more extensive than necessary to serve the substantial governmental interests identified in this statement of purpose.

                  Sec. 34-235. - Intent. 
                  The intent of this article to regulate the time, place, and manner of signs in a minimal manner sufficient to meet the public purposes articulated in section 34-234. 
                  (Res. of 10-12-2004(3), § 9.2) 
                  Sec. 34-236. - Applicability. 
                  A sign may be erected, placed, established, painted, created, or maintained within the planning jurisdiction of the city only in conformance with the standards, procedures, exemptions, and other requirements of this article. The effect of this article as more specifically set forth herein shall: 
                  (1)  Establish a permit system to allow a variety of types of signs in commercial, residential and industrial zoning districts that are subject to the standards and the permit procedures of this article. 
                  (2)  Allow certain signs that are small, unobtrusive and incidental to the principal use of the respective lots on which they are located, subject to the substantive requirements of this article, but without a requirement for permits. 
                  (3)  Provide for temporary signs without commercial messages in limited circumstances in the public right-of-way. 
                  (4)  Prohibit all signs not expressly permitted by this article. 
                  (5)  Provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this article.

                  Sec. 34-237. - Master signage plan required. 
                  (a)  No permit shall be issued for an individual sign requiring a permit unless and until a master signage plan or a common signage plan for the lot on which the sign will be erected has been submitted to and approval recommended by the city planning commission as conforming to this section 
                  (b)  For any lot on which the owner proposes to erect one or more signs requiring a permit, unless such lot is included in a common signage plan, the owner shall submit to the city a master signage plan containing the following: 
                  (1)  An accurate plat of the lot at such scale as the city may reasonably require. 
                  (2)  Location of buildings, parking lots, driveways, and landscaped areas on such lot. 
                  (3)  Computation of the maximum total sign area, the maximum area for individual signs, the height of signs, and the number of freestanding signs allowed on the lots included in the plan under this article. 
                  (4)  An accurate indication on the plat of the proposed location of each present and future sign of any type, whether requiring a permit or not, except that incidental signs and signs not regulated by this article need not be shown 
                  (5)  The name of the owner of the property and, if different than the owner, the name of the applicant. 
                  (6)  Property owners may place signs throughout the city to show direction to a farm business or other business but shall conform to the master signage plan by showing on a map where each sign will be placed before obtaining a permit.

                  Sec. 34-238. - Common signage plan. 
                  If the owners of two or more contiguous lots, or the owner of a single lot with more than one building (not including any accessory building) file with the city for such lots a common signage plan conforming with the provisions of this section, a 25 percent increase in the maximum total sign area shall be allowed for each included lot. This bonus may be allocated within each lot as the owners elect. 
                  (1)  Provisions of common signage plan. The common signage plan shall contain all of the information required for a master signage plan and shall also specify standards for consistency among all signs on the lots affected by the plan with regard to: 
                  a.  Color scheme; 
                  b.  Lighting; 
                  c.  Location of each sign on the buildings; 
                  d.  Material; and 
                  e.  Sign proportions. 
                  (2)  Limit on freestanding signs under common signage plan. The common signage plan, for all lots with multiple uses or multiple users, shall limit the number of freestanding signs to a total of one for each street on which the lots included in the plan have frontage and shall provide for shared or common usage of such signs. In any instance where the properties included within a common signage plan may contain an intervening street, the number of freestanding signs shall be limited to one for each street and such properties shall be treated as a unified lot. The maximum height of the freestanding signs permitted shall be 30 square feet. 
                  (3)  Other provisions of master or common signage plans. The master or common signage plan may contain such other restrictions as the owners of the lots may reasonably determine. 
                  (4)  Consent. The master or common signage plan shall be signed by all owners or authorized agents in such form as the city shall require. 
                  (5)  Joint processing. A master or common signage plan shall be included in any development plan, site plan, planned unit development plan, or other official plan required by the city for the proposed development and shall be processed simultaneously with such other plans. 
                  (6)  Amendment. To amend a master or common signage plan, a new master or common signage plan shall be filed that conforms with all requirements of the ordinance in effect. In general, amendments shall be reviewed and acted upon by the city; provided, however, that any amendment of a common signage plan which affects those items governed by subsection (1) of this section shall be acted upon in a like procedure to the original plan.

                  Sec. 34-261. - Computations. 
                  The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign height: 
                  (1)  Computation of area of individual signs. The area of a sign face (which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face) shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall. 
                  (2)  Computation of area of multi-faced signs. The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two identical sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces. 
                  (3)  Computation of height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest point of the sign face. Normal grade shall be construed to be the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade of the sign is lower than the grade of the adjacent public street, normal grade shall be construed to be the grade of the adjacent public street. The term "adjacent public street" shall mean the street providing approved vehicle access to the property and which does or would bear the street address for the property. 
                  (4)  Computation of maximum total permitted sign area. Lots fronting on two or more streets are allowed the permitted sign area for each street frontage. However, the total sign area that is oriented toward a particular street may not exceed the portion of the lot's total sign area allocation that is derived from the lot, building, or wall area frontage on that street.

                  Sec. 34-262. - Design, construction, and maintenance. 
                  All signs shall be designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with the following standards: 
                  (1)  Except for banners, flags, and temporary signs conforming in all respects with the requirements of this article, all signs shall be constructed of permanent materials and shall be permanently attached to the ground, a building, or other structure by direct attachment to a rigid wall, frame, or structure. 
                  (2)  Every sign, including, but not limited to, those signs for which permits are required, shall be maintained in a safe, presentable, and sound structural condition. 
                  a.  To prevent rust, peeling, flaking, fading or rotting, all signs and supports shall be painted, unless anodized or similarly treated. 
                  b.  Broken panels, missing letters, defective illumination, torn fabric, flaking or peeling paint and other damage to a sign shall be replaced or repaired. 
                  (3)  If a determination is made by the city that any sign is unsafe, not secure, in violation of this section, or is in violation of any applicable law or a public danger, notice of such violation shall be given to the property owner and/or occupant where such sign is located. The property owner and/or occupant shall have 30 days from the date of said notice to remove, repair, or remedy said violation.

                  Sec. 34-263. - Signs in the public right-of-way. 
                  No signs shall be allowed in the public right-of-way except the following: 
                  (1)  Permanent signs. 
                  (2)  Public signs erected by or on behalf of a governmental body to post legal notices, identify public property, convey public information, and direct or regulate pedestrian or vehicular traffic. 
                  (3)  Bus stop signs erected by a public transit company. 
                  (4)  Informational signs of a public utility regarding its poles, lines, pipes, or facilities. 
                  (5)  Awning, projecting, and suspended signs projecting over a public right-of-way are permitted with a permit.

                  (4)  Inflatable signs and tethered balloons not in accordance with subsection (5) of this section. 
                  (5)  Signs painted on or attached to trees, fence posts, rocks or other natural features, telephone or utility poles, or painted on the roofs of buildings visible from any public thoroughfare. 
                  (6)  Signs using the words "stop," "danger," or any other word, phrase, symbol or character in a manner to mislead, confuse or distract a vehicle driver. 
                  (7)  Trailer signs. 
                  (8)  Roof signs. 
                  (9)  Any sign or sign structure other than a freestanding and vertical wall extension, any portion of which extends above the parapet, building roofline or canopy against which the sign is located.

                  O.C.G.A. § 32-6-83 states, "Any municipal corporation or city is authorized to acquire by purchase, gift, or condemnation and to pay just compensation for any property rights in outdoor advertising signs, displays, and devices which were lawfully erected but which do not conform with the provisions of any lawful ordinance, regulation, or resolution or which at a later date fail to comply with the provisions of any lawful ordinance, regulation, or resolution due to changed conditions beyond the control of the sign owner. No municipal corporation or city shall remove or cause to be removed any such nonconforming outdoor advertising sign, display, or device without paying just compensation." In accordance, signs existing in the planning jurisdiction which were made nonconforming by the adoption of this resolution shall be permitted to remain in place and be maintained, provided that no action is taken which increases the degree or extent of the nonconformity.

                  Sec. 34-266. - Criteria for approval of sign variances. 
                  A variance may be granted upon application if an individual case of unusual hardship is placed upon the applicant. The request for a variance must meet the following conditions: 
                  (1)  There exist extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the property in question resulting from its size, shape, or topography that are not applicable to other lands or structures in the area. 
                  (2)  A literal interpretation of the provisions of this article would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other similar properties. 
                  (3)  Granting the variance requested would not confer upon the property of the applicant any significant privileges that are denied to other similar properties. 
                  (4)  The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of these regulations and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or to the general welfare. 
                  (5)  The special circumstances are not the result of actions of the applicant. 
                  (6)  The variance is not a request to permit a type of sign which otherwise is prohibited by this article. 
                  (7)  The mere existence of a nonconforming sign or advertising device shall not constitute a valid reason to grant a variance.

                  (2)  Maximum sign height is 24 feet, and minimum setback is five feet; however, in no case shall the actual sign height exceed the actual sign setback from any adjacent lot that is zoned and used for residential purposes. For example, if the sign is set back seven feet from such a lot, it may be no more than seven feet high. 
                  (3)  In addition to the setback requirements on this table, signs shall be located such that there is at every street intersection a clear view between heights of three feet and ten feet in a triangle formed by the corner and points on the curb 30 feet from the intersection or entrance way. 
                  (4)  The percentage figure here shall mean the percentage of the area of the wall of which such sign is a part or to which each such sign is most nearly parallel; provided, however, that the area of such signs shall not exceed the area of a freestanding sign permitted for the property.

                  (3)  A nonconforming use of a structure shall not be extended or enlarged except into portions of the structure which at the time the use became nonconforming were already erected and arranged or designed for such nonconforming use. No structural alterations shall be made in any structure occupied by a nonconforming use which would in any way increase the floor space, area, or volume of space occupied by the use. 
                  (4)  When any nonconforming use of a structure is discontinued for a period in excess of one year, any future use of the structure shall be limited to those uses permitted in that district under the provisions of this chapter. Vacancy and/or non-use of the building, regardless of the intent of the owner or tenant, shall constitute discontinuance under this provision.

                  Sec. 34-302. - Reconstruction of nonconforming structures. 
                  When a nonconforming structure or a structure containing a nonconforming use or nonconforming sign is razed or damaged by fire, flood, wind, or act of God, such structure or sign may be reconstructed as a nonconforming use only if the damage totals less than 50 percent of the value of the structure. If the nonconforming structure is damaged more than 50 percent, the structure may be rebuilt only if it conforms to this chapter, as adopted. Nonconforming manufactured homes located in a manufactured home park may be replaced according to Type III appearance standards. Structures which do not conform to the yard requirements of this chapter shall also be governed by this provision.

                  The city council may grant the change, reestablishment or enlargement of a nonconforming use or the enlargement, rebuilding, alteration, repair or replacement of a nonconforming structure upon the following findings: 
                  (1)  The change, reestablishment, enlargement, rebuilding, alteration, repair or replacement would be no more detrimental to the surrounding area than the existing or previous use. 
                  (2)  The structure cannot be economically modified so as to be suitable for uses in the district. 
                  (3)  The structure has such value that removal to permit development of the conforming uses would cause economic hardship to the owner. 
                  (4)  The proposed change, reestablishment, enlargement, rebuilding, alteration, replacement or repair would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of this chapter. 
                  (5)  The requirements of this chapter for rezoning would prevent the current zoning from being changed to a classification that would allow the proposed change, reestablishment, enlargement, rebuilding, alteration, repair or replacement.

                  Sec. 34-362. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this article is to establish general guidelines for the siting of towers and antennas. The goals of this article are to: 
                  (1)  Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas and minimize the total number of towers throughout the city; 
                  (2)  Strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites; 
                  (3)  Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the city is minimal; 
                  (4)  Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way to minimize the adverse visual impact to the city; 
                  (5)  Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the city quickly, effectively and efficiently.

                  The guidelines set forth in this section shall govern the location of all towers, and the installation of all antennas governed by this article. 
                  (1)  Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  (2)  At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping which will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
                  (3)  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or is closely comparable with, the supporting structure and/or surrounding area so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
                  (4)  Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the city council may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design which would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views.

                  (3)  Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties; 
                  (4)  Surrounding topography; 
                  (5)  Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness;

                  (b)  Availability of suitable existing towers or other structures. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the governing authority that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may consist of any of the following: 
                  (1)  No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet the applicant's engineering requirements. 
                  (2)  Existing towers and structures do not have sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements. 
                  (3)  Existing towers and structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment. 
                  (4)  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
                  (5)  The fees, costs or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable. 
                  (6)  The applicant demonstrates there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unreasonable.
