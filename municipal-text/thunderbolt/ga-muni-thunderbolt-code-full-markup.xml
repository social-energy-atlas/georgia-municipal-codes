PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a complete codification of the ordinances of Thunderbolt, Georgia of a general and permanent nature. The Code supersedes all such ordinances not included herein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. 
                  The source of each section is included in the history note which appears in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Table appearing in the back of the volume, the reader can locate all laws and ordinances included herein. 
                  The various sections within each chapter have been appropriately catchlined to facilitate usage. Appropriate footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which also refer to relevant state laws have been included. 
                  Numbering System 
                  The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-101 and the fifth section of Chapter 4 is 4-105. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and, at the same time, new sections, or even whole chapters, can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this looseleaf system, the Code will be kept-up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Codes with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Index 
                  The index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by city officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested.

                  SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
                  The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code Book and are considered "Includes." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code Book and are considered "Omits." 
                  In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

               A vacancy occurring in the office of mayor shall be filled by the mayor pro tempore as provided in Section 6, and the vacancy shall therefore transfer to the office of alderman. Any vacancy occurring in the office of alderman shall be filled for the unexpired term by a majority vote of the remaining aldermen and mayor within 15 days of the occurrence of such vacancy. If the council fails to fill such vacancy within the time specified, provided that the remaining portion of said unexpired term is longer than six months, the council shall at once set the date for a special city election to be held within 30 days, which shall be held and managed in the same manner as herein provided for city elections and at which a successor for the unexpired term shall be elected. If after 15 days from the date of such vacancy the council has failed to fill such vacancy and provided that the remaining portion of said unexpired term is less than six months, said office of alderman shall remain vacant until the next regular city election. Any vacancy which might exist at the time of the effective date of this Act shall be treated as if it occurred on the day after such effective date; provided, however, this shall not alter any prior provisions for filling said vacancy, which provisions would cause the vacancy to be filled at an earlier date.

The mayor and aldermen are authorized and empowered to elect a recorder to hold said court and to fix the qualifications, term of office and compensation. Said recorder so elected shall take such oath as may be prescribed by the mayor and aldermen. Any vacancy in the office of the recorder shall be filled by the mayor and aldermen.

The court shall also have concurrent jurisdiction with that of the magistrate court over offenses against the criminal laws of the state committed within the corporate limits. Except as may be otherwise specified in this charter, the judge is vested with all of the jurisdiction and powers as to the entire area within the corporate limits of the Town of Thunderbolt.

The judge is authorized to administer oaths. 
               (c)  The recorder is authorized to issue warrants for offenses committed within the corporate limits of said town against any law or ordinance of said town or this State. When the offense is against the State, the recorder may hear evidence and commit to jail or take bond for appearance before the Senate court having jurisdiction of the offense as a justice of the peace could do. If the offense charged in the warrant be one against the laws or ordinances of the town, the arresting officers shall carry the case before the recorder's court and none other, with the same thereby disposed of as other cases of arrest not made under warrant. All warrants issued by the recorder or the recorder pro tempore acting in his stead shall be directed to any policeman or marshal of the Town of Thunderbolt and to all and singular the sheriffs, deputy sheriffs and constables of this State. Any one of said officers shall have the same authority to execute said warrants as the sheriffs of this State have to execute criminal warrants. 
               (d)  The recorder or the recorder pro tempore acting in his stead shall have the power and authority to subpoena witnesses to attend the recorder's court under the same rules and regulations that regulate and govern the superior courts of this State, to compel their attendance, and to punish any witness who has been subpoenaed and who failed to attend under the provisions for contempt already provided for in this charter. 
               (e)  In all cases in the recorder's court of the Town of Thunderbolt, the costs incurred and allowable herein may be computed under the provisions of the laws of the State of Georgia fixing costs in the justice of the peace courts of said State or the town council may establish a schedule of fees to defray the costs of operation, and the city shall be entitled to reimbursement of the cost, meals, transportation and caretaking of prisoners bound over the superior court for violations of State law. The town council may also provide a uniform scale of costs of the clerk and police officers of said city and for all services in the arrest and prosecution of offenders in the recorder's court and in the issuance and collection of tax and other executions and for their collections and payment into the town treasury. The recorder is hereby authorized to issue such other processes as may be necessary to the proper administration of said court. 
               (f)  The town council shall prescribe by ordinance such other rules and regulations as shall be deemed necessary in connection with the court and its operation, including provision for the summary forfeiture of appearance bonds. 
               (g)  There may be an appeal in any case from the recorder's court to the mayor and aldermen, which appeal must be entered in writing and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed and determined by said mayor and aldermen, and the judgment of the mayor and aldermen may be reviewed by certiorari to the Superior Court of Chatham County as provided for in Code Chapter 19-2 of the Code of Georgia of 1933, as amended.

It shall be the duty of the chief of police or other levying officer into whose hands such executions are placed to levy the same, to advertise the sale of the property so levied upon and to sell the same, all in the same manner and by the same procedure as sheriff's sales of real estate are levied upon, advertised and sold under executions or fi. fas. in Chatham County, Georgia. In such cases, the defendant in execution shall have the right to file an affidavit of illegality if such execution shall have issued illegally or if it is proceeding illegally. In either of such cases, such execution shall be returned by the levying officer to the Superior Court of Chatham County for trial as in other cases of affidavit of illegality; provided, however, a qualified bond shall be made and filed as in other cases of illegality. Such sales shall have the same force and effect as a sheriff's sale of similar property, and the officer making such sale shall have the same power as a sheriff to put purchasers of such sold property in possession thereof. Whenever at any such sale, no one present shall offer as much for the property levied upon as the amount of such execution together with all interest and costs thereon, after such property shall have been offered a reasonable time, the town, through its authorized agent, shall bid on such property and shall purchase the property on behalf of the town for not more than the amount of such execution, interest and costs if the value of such property is sufficient to cover such principal, interest and costs. The officer conducting and making the sale shall make and deliver to the town a deed or bill of sale, as the case may be, to the property so sold and the title thus acquired by the town shall be and become perfect and absolute and valid when the owner's right of redemption, if any, shall have expired pursuant to existing law. The officer making the sale shall put the town in possession and the town council shall have no right or authority to divest or alienate the title of the town to the property so purchased except by public sale for cash to the highest bidder therefor, which sale shall be conducted at the time and place and in the manner which shall be prescribed by ordinance of the town. 
               (b)  The forms of executions for ad valorem taxes, special taxes, other taxes, costs of construction of streets, street curbing, sidewalks, sewers and for repairs or improvements of any thereof; for fines and forfeitures in the recorder's court of the town; and for any other expenses, costs, charges, licenses or assessments of every nature whatsoever owed to the town shall be prescribed by ordinance.

               Section 32. - Appearance bonds.

The council shall appropriate a sum sufficient to cover the debts service, including the sinking fund and interest on bonded indebtedness, which sum shall not be diverted to any other department or departments by the council during the year. Should the income of the town be decreased by law or otherwise, it shall be the duty of the council to immediately adjust its budget so as to comply with such decreased revenue. In the event of any increase in revenue, which increase has become definite and reasonably certain by an increase in income, the council may revise the budget accordingly and take such anticipated receipts into consideration in the budget. 
               (b)  After the budget has been adopted, the council may transfer or reallocate funds, with the exception of appropriations for debt services. 
               Section 34. - Authority to secure loans. 
               The  council has authority to borrow money to meet casual deficiencies in the revenues of the town; provided, however, the loans thus negotiated shall not extend over a period longer than 12 months and shall be paid out of the revenues of the current fiscal year for which provision shall be made by tax levy or other authorized collections for the current fiscal year. 
               Section 35. - Expenditures from town treasury. 
               All  sums authorized to be paid or expended by the town under authority of this Act or general law shall be paid from the treasury of the Town of Thunderbolt.

This exemption shall not apply to taxes assessed on improvements to the homestead or additional land that is added to the homestead after January 1 of the base year. If any real property is removed from the homestead, the adjusted base year assessed value shall be calculated reflecting such removal. The value of that property in excess of such exempted amount shall remain subject to taxation. 
               (b.1)  (1)  In the case of an unremarried surviving spouse of a deceased spouse who had been granted the exemption provided for in subsection (b) of this section, if such unremarried surviving spouse applies for and is granted such exemption in the 2005 taxable year, notwithstanding any other provision of this Act to the contrary, the base year for that unremarried surviving spouse shall be the same as the base year of the deceased spouse, so long as that unremarried surviving spouse continues to occupy the home as a residence and homestead.

Otherwise, a person shall not receive the homestead exemption granted by subsection (b) of this section unless the person or person's agent files an application with the governing authority of the City of Thunderbolt, or the designee thereof, giving such information relative to receiving such exemption as will enable such governing authority or designee thereof to make a determination as to whether such owner is entitled to such exemption. 
               (d)  The governing authority of the City of Thunderbolt, or the designee thereof, shall provide application forms for the exemption granted by subsection (b) of this section which shall require such information as may be necessary to determine the initial and continuing eligibility of the owner for the exemption.

The exemption shall be automatically renewed from year to year as long as the owner occupies the residence as a homestead. After a person has filed the proper application as provided in subsection (c) of this section, it shall not be necessary to make application and file such affidavit thereafter for any year and the exemption shall continue to be allowed to such person. It shall be the duty of any person granted them homestead exemption under subsection (b) of this section to notify the governing authority of the City of Thunderbolt, or the designee thereof, in the event that person for any reason becomes ineligible for that exemption.

                  Sec. 2-102. - Code of ethics. 
                  1.  Intent . It is essential to the proper administration and operation of the Town of Thunderbolt that the members of its governing authority be, and give the appearance of being, independent and impartial; that public office not be used for private gain; and that there be public confidence in the integrity of the governing authority. The governing authority finds that the public interest requires that they protect against such conflicts of interest by establishing appropriate ethical standards with respect to the conduct of the members of the governing authority in situations where a conflict may exist. 
                  2.  Definitions. As used in this chapter, the term: 
                  A.  Complaint means a written sworn statement filed with the mayor or mayor pro term containing specific allegations of misconduct by a member; provided, however, such allegations must be filed within six months of discovery of the alleged misconduct. 
                  B.  Interest means any direct financial benefit, which is not a remote interest held by or accruing to a member of the governing authority as a result of a contract or transaction that is or may be the subject of an official act or action by or with the town. A member of the governing authority shall be deemed to have an interest in transactions involving: 
                  (1)  Any person in the member's immediate family; 
                  (2)  Any person with whom a contractual relationship exists whereby the member may receive any payment or other benefits unless the member is receiving a benefit for goods or services in the normal course of business for which the member has paid a commercially reasonable rate; 
                  (3)  Any business in which the member is a director, officer, employee, agent, or shareholder, except as otherwise provided herein; 
                  (4)  "Governing authority" or "member of the governing authority" means the mayor or any council member of the Town of Thunderbolt and any member appointed to any boards or commissions of the Town of Thunderbolt. 
                  3.  Prohibitions . No member of the governing authority shall:

                  B.  Directly or indirectly request, exact, receive, or agree to receive a gift, loan, favor, promise, or thing of value for him/herself or another person if it could reasonably be considered to influence the member in the discharge of official duties; 
                  C.  Disclose or otherwise use confidential information acquired by virtue of his/her official position for his/her or another person's private gain; 
                  D.  Use his/her official position to attempt to secure privileges that are not available to the general public; 
                  E.  Engage in, accept employment with, or render services for any private business or professional activity when such employment or rendering of services is adverse to and incompatible with the proper discharge of official duties; 
                  F.  Engage in any activity or transaction that is prohibited by law now existing or hereafter enacted which is applicable to him/her by virtue of being a member of the governing authority;

                  H.  Do clerical work on behalf of the member's family, business, social, church or fraternal interest when such work is not furthering a town interest; 
                  I.  Perform any work outside the employee's normal course of municipal employment; 
                  J.  Purchase goods or services to be used for personal, business, or political purposes; and

                  (7)  Restrictions on contracts with former members of the governing authority . The town shall not enter into any contract with any person or business represented by such person, who has been within the preceding 12-month period a member of the governing authority, unless the contract is awarded by a competitive bid or a committee selection process.

                  ARTICLE III. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION 
                  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 

                  Sec. 5-301. - Statutory authorization. 
                  A.  Article IX, section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and section 36-35-3 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the mayor and council of the Town of Thunderbolt, Georgia, does ordain as follows: 
                  B.  Findings of fact. 
                  (1)  The flood hazard areas of the Town of Thunderbolt are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (2)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  C.  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  D.  Objectives . The objectives of this chapter are: 
                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditures of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
                  Sec. 5-302. - General provision. 
                  A.  Lands to which this chapter applies. This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Town of Thunderbolt. 
                  B.  Basis for area of special flood hazard. The "Areas of Special Flood Hazard" identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its Flood Insurance Study (FIS), dated 9/26/2008 (i.e., most current FIRM map), with accompanying maps and other supporting data, and any revision thereto, are adopted by reference and declared a part of this chapter. For those land areas acquired by a municipality through annexation, the current effective FIS, supporting data and any revision thereto, for Chatham County (*unincorporated county*), dated 9/26/2008 (i.e., most current FIRM map of county), are hereby adopted by reference. 
                  Areas of special flood hazard may also include those areas known to have flooded historically or defined through standard engineering analysis by governmental agencies or private parties but not yet incorporated in a FIS. (*Specifically identify*) 
                  The repository for public inspection of the flood insurance study (FIS), accompanying maps and other supporting data is located in the Zoning Administrator's office at 2821 River Drive, Thunderbolt, Georgia. 
                  C.  Establishment of development permit. A development permit shall be required in conformance with the provision of this chapter prior to the commencement of any development activities.

                  (1)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
                  (2)  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
                  (3)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
                  G.  Warning and disclaimer of liability . The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Town of Thunderbolt, Georgia or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
                  H.  Penalties for violation . Failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter or with any of its requirements, including conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions shall constitute a violation. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $1,000.00 and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Town of Thunderbolt, Georgia from taking such other lawful actions as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters; 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this chapter, shall be undertaken only if the non-conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
                  B.  Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazard designated as A1-30, AE, AH, A (with estimated BFE), the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection (A)(4) of this section, "Elevated Buildings." 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction . New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above in section 5-303(C)(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles . Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  (a)  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (b)  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an either existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that: 
                  (i)  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  (ii)  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  (c)  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. subsection (A)(6) above.) 
                  (d)  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  (i)  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  (ii)  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  (iii)  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "New Construction," including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (B)(3)(a)—(c) above. 
                  (4)  Floodway . Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 5-302(B), are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (a)  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  (b)  Only if subsection (B)(4)(a) above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section. 
                  C.  Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-zones) . Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 5-302(B), where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 5-302(B), then the zoning administrator or his/her designee shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this section. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2 and 3) shall apply: 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 25 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (Note: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection (A)(4) "Elevated Buildings." 
                  (a)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  The zoning administrator or his/her designee shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  D.  Standards for areas of special flood hazard (zones AE) with established base flood elevations without designated floodways. Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 5-302(B), where streams with base flood elevations are provided but no floodways have been designated, (zones AE), the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 
                  (2)  New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or floodproofed to elevations established in accordance with section 5-304(B). 
                  E.  Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones) . Areas of special flood hazard established in section 5-302(B), may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection (A)(4), "Elevated Buildings." 
                  The zoning administrator or his/her designee shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in section 5-303(B)(1)(c) and (B)(2). 
                  (3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure. 
                  F.  Coastal high hazard areas (V-zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 5-302(B), are areas designated as coastal high hazard areas (V-zones). These areas have special flood hazards associated with wave action and storm surge; therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be located landward of the reach of mean high tide; 
                  (2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be elevated on piles, columns, or shear walls parallel to the flow of water so that the bottom of the lowest supporting horizontal structural member (excluding pilings or columns) is located no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation level. All space below the lowest supporting member shall remain free of obstruction or constructed with non-supporting breakaway walls. Open wood lattice work or decorative screening may be permitted for aesthetic purposes only and must be designed to wash away in the event of abnormal wave action and in accordance with subsection (F)(6) below; 
                  (3)  All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be securely anchored on pilings, columns, or shear walls; 
                  (4)  All pile and column foundations and the structures attached thereto shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the combined effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components, both (non-structural and structural). Water loading values shall equal or exceed those of the base flood. Wind loading values shall be in accordance with the most current edition of the International Building Code; 
                  (5)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design, specifications and plans for construction are in compliance with the provisions contained in subsection (F)(2), (3), (4) herein; 
                  (6)  All space below the lowest horizontal supporting member must remain free of obstruction. Open wood lattice work or decorative screening may be permitted for aesthetic purposes only and must be designed to wash away in the event of abnormal wave action without causing structural damage to the supporting foundation or elevated portion of the structure. The following design specifications are allowed: 
                  (a)  No solid walls shall be allowed; and 
                  (b)  Material shall consist of open wood lattice or mesh screening only. 
                  (c)  If aesthetic open wood lattice work or screening is utilized, any enclosed space shall not be used for human habitation, but shall be designed to be used only for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. 
                  (7)  Prior to construction, plans for any structures having open wood latticework or decorative screening must be submitted to the zoning administrator or his/her designee for approval; 
                  (8)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to any structure shall not enclose the space below the lowest floor except with open wood latticework or decorative screening, as provided in this section; 
                  (9)  There shall be no fill used as structural support. Non-compacted fill may be used around the perimeter of a building for landscaping/aesthetic purposes provided the fill will wash out from storm surge, (thereby rendering the building free of obstruction) prior to generating excessive loading forces, ramping effects, or wave deflection. The zoning administrator or his/her designee shall approve design plans for landscaping/aesthetic fill only after the applicant has provided an analysis by an engineer, architect, and/or soil scientist, which demonstrates that the following factors have been fully considered: 
                  (a)  Particle composition of fill material does not have a tendency for excessive natural compaction; 
                  (b)  Volume and distribution of fill will not cause wave defection to adjacent properties; and 
                  (c)  Slope of fill will not cause wave run-up or ramping. 
                  (10)  There shall be no alteration of sand dunes or mangrove stands, which would increase potential flood damage; 
                  (11)  Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes), except in an existing manufactured homes park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of subsection (F)(4) are met. 
                  G.  Standards for subdivisions. 
                  (1)  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
                  (2)  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
                  (3)  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and 
                  (4)  For subdivisions and/or developments greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less, base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions. Any changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted to FEMA for review as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. Upon completion of the project, the developer is responsible for submitting the "as-built" data to FEMA in order to obtain the final LOMR. 
                  H.  Standard for critical facilities. 
                  (1)  Critical facilities shall not be located in the 100-year floodplain or the 500-year floodplain. 
                  (2)  All ingress and egress from any critical facility must be protected to the 500-year flood elevation. 
                  Sec. 5-305. - Variance procedures. 
                  (A)  The zoning board as established by the Town of Thunderbolt, Georgia shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (B)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by zoning administrator or his/her designee in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
                  (C)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the zoning board may appeal such decision to the town council. Appeals to the decision made by town council may be taken to superior court. 
                  (D)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (E)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (F)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (G)  In reviewing such requests, the zoning board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
                  (H)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  (i)  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  (ii)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  (iii)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The zoning administrator or his/her designee shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (I)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the zoning board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is:

                  2.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this Code. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities.

                  New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after July 2, 1987 [the effective date of the initial FIRM] and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after November 14, 1979 [the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the community] and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after November 4, 1979 [i.e., the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community]. 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA flood modernization maps. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle, which is: 
                  a.  Built on a single chassis; 
                  b.  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
                  c.  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
                  d.  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. Note: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
                  (1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
                  (2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the structure commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  E.  These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the municipal separate storm sewer system. 
                  F.  Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system. 
                  Therefore, the Town of Thunderbolt adopts this chapter to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment. 
                  2.  Purpose . The purpose of this article is to provide for the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the Town of Thunderbolt through the regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the storm drainage system to the maximum extent practicable. The objectives of this article are: 
                  A.  To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the MS4 by stormwater discharges by any user; 
                  B.  To prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the MS4; and 
                  C.  To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection; surveillance and monitoring; and enforcement procedures as necessary to ensure compliance with this article. 
                  3.  Applicability . This article shall apply to all non-stormwater discharges entering the storm drain system generated on any developed or undeveloped lands unless explicitly exempted by the Town of Thunderbolt under section 5-319 of this article. 
                  4.  Discharge prohibitions. 
                  1.  Prohibition of illegal discharges. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the MS4 or watercourses any materials, including, but not limited to, pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, other than stormwater. 
                  The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited except as described as follows: 
                  A.  The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions established by this article: water line flushing or other potable water sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped ground water, foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs, non-commercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wetland flows, swimming pools (if dechlorinated—typically less than one PPM chlorine), firefighting activities, and any other water source not containing pollutants. 
                  B.  Discharges specified in writing by the Town of Thunderbolt as being necessary to protect public health and safety. 
                  C.  Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal notification to the Town of Thunderbolt 24 hours prior to the time of the test followed by written notice within ten days. 
                  D.  Any non-stormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal Environmental Protection Division, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm drain system. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the Town of Thunderbolt prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. 
                  E.  Any stormwater discharge regulated under an NPDES stormwater discharge permit for industrial activities provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the Town of Thunderbolt prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. 
                  F.  Any stormwater discharge regulated under an NPDES stormwater discharge permit for construction activities or other local land disturbance permit provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the Town of Thunderbolt prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. 
                  5.  Prohibition of illicit connections. The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the MS4 or watercourses is prohibited. This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. 
                  6.  Suspension of MS4 access. 
                  1.  Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. 
                  A.  The Town of Thunderbolt may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge that presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the Town of Thunderbolt may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons. 
                  B.  Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 or watercourses in violation of this article may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The Town of Thunderbolt will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the Town of Thunderbolt for a reconsideration and hearing. 
                  A person commits a violation of this article if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior written approval of the Town of Thunderbolt. 
                  7.  Monitoring of discharges. 
                  1.  Applicability . This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction activity. 
                  2.  Access to facilities. 
                  A.  The Town of Thunderbolt shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this article as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this article. If a discharger has security measures in force, which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the Town of Thunderbolt. 
                  B.  Facility operators shall allow the Town of Thunderbolt ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law. 
                  C.  The Town of Thunderbolt shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the Town of Thunderbolt to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge. 
                  D.  The Town of Thunderbolt has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
                  E.  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the Town of Thunderbolt and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator. 
                  F.  Unreasonable delays in allowing the Town of Thunderbolt access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this article. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits a violation if the person denies the Town of Thunderbolt reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this article. 
                  G.  If the Town of Thunderbolt has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the Town of Thunderbolt may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction. 
                  8.  Requirement to prevent, control and reduce stormwater pollutants. 
                  1.  Specification of best management practices. The Town of Thunderbolt may adopt requirements identifying best management practices (BMPs) for any activity, operation, or facility, which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the MS4 or watercourses, or waters of the United States. 
                  2.  Pollution prevention in new facilities. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the MS4 or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. 
                  3.  Pollution prevention in existing facilities. Any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the MS4 or watercourses. 
                  4.  Discharge permits from regulatory agencies other than the Town of Thunderbolt. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliant with the provisions of this section. BMPs designated for compliance with the NPDES permit or BMPs implemented as a result of action taken in compliance of this article shall be included in a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. 
                  9.  Watercourse protection. Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse. 
                  10.  Notification of spills. Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the MS4 or watercourses, or waters of the United States, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the Town of Thunderbolt in person, by phone, facsimile or email no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the director of public works of the Town of Thunderbolt within three business days of the phone notice. The notification of the discharge of materials to the Town of Thunderbolt shall be in addition to notification of other applicable county, regional, state and federal authorities. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years. 
                  Sec. 5-319. - Post construction stormwater runoff—General provisions. 
                  1.  Findings of fact. It is hereby determined that: 
                  A.  Land development activities alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds, increasing stormwater runoff rates, velocities, volumes, and pollutant loads, and increase flooding, channel erosion, and pollutant transport and deposition in rivers and streams; 
                  B.  Land development activities alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds, increasing stormwater runoff rates, velocities, volumes, and pollutant loads, and, consequently, alter water levels and fluctuations and increase pollutant transport and deposition in wetlands; 
                  C.  Land development activities alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds, increasing stormwater runoff rates, velocities, volumes, and pollutant loads, and alter salinity concentrations and fluctuations and increase productivity and pollutant transport and deposition in estuaries; 
                  D.  Land development activities alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds, increasing stormwater runoff rates, velocities, volumes, and pollutant loads, and increase bacteria transport and deposition in near coastal waters, which leads to beach contamination and closure and poses a serious threat to human health; 
                  E.  Land development activities alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds, increasing stormwater runoff rates and volumes, and, consequently, decreasing the amount of rainfall that is available to recharge shallow groundwater aquifers; 
                  F.  The negative impacts of land development activities on these important local aquatic resources can adversely affect the health, safety and general welfare of the public; 
                  G.  The negative impacts of land development can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff rates, velocities, volumes, and pollutant loads on development and redevelopment sites; 
                  H.  Communities within the coastal nonpoint source management area are required to comply with specific state and federal regulations that require the adverse impacts of increased stormwater runoff rates, volumes and pollutant loads to be controlled and minimized; 
                  Therefore, the Town of Thunderbolt has determined that it is in the public interest to control and minimize the adverse impacts of land development activities and has established this set of stormwater management provisions to regulate post-construction stormwater runoff rates, velocities, volumes and pollutant loads on development and redevelopment sites. 
                  2.  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this chapter is to protect and maintain the integrity of local aquatic resources, and, consequently, the health, safety and welfare of the general public, by establishing minimum stormwater management provisions that control and minimize the adverse impacts of land development activities. This chapter seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
                  A.  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of local aquatic resources; 
                  B.  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria that will reduce flooding, channel erosion, and pollutant transport and deposition in local aquatic resources; 
                  C.  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria that will help preserve existing hydrologic conditions and development and redevelopment sites; 
                  D.  Establish design criteria for structural and nonstructural stormwater management practices that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria; 
                  E.  Encourage the use of better site planning, better site design and low impact development practices, such as those found in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual (GSMM) and the Coastal Stormwater Supplement (CSS), to the maximum extent practical at development and redevelopment sites to mimic the pre-development hydrologic function of the site by encouraging natural processes that detain and filter stormwater runoff pollutants; 
                  F.  Establish provisions for the long-term upkeep and maintenance of structural and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed and pose a minimal threat to public safety; 
                  G.  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans and for the inspection of approved land development projects; 
                  H.  Identify and protect existing natural systems from potential adverse impacts resulting from land development activities and post construction stormwater runoff; and 
                  I.  Balance development demands and natural resource protection through the implementation of low impact planning, design and development strategies. 
                  3.  Applicability . This chapter shall be applicable to all land development activities, including, but not limited to, site plan applications, subdivision applications, and grading applications, unless exempt pursuant to subsection (4) below. These standards apply to any new development or redevelopment activity within Town of Thunderbolt that meets one or more of the following criteria: 
                  A.  New development that involves the creation of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover or that involves other land development activities of one acre or more; 
                  B.  Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition, or replacement of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover or that involves other land development activities of one acre or more; 
                  C.  Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is defined by the Town of Thunderbolt to be a hotspot land use; 
                  D.  Development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth above if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate, and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules; 
                  E.  For development of a project in phases, a stormwater master plan is required to conceptually indicate how the minimum requirements of this article will be met. This does not preclude the requirements of a SWMP for each phase as it is being developed. The master plan of multi-phased developments shall consolidate stormwater management facilities to as much as practical; or 
                  F.  The existence of a stormwater master plan, approved prior to the date of adoption of this chapter, does not necessarily preclude compliance with the requirements of this chapter for each subsequent phase as it is being developed. However, the town manager or his designee will favorably consider the existence of a site-specific stormwater master plan that is substantially compliant with this chapter when evaluating the applicability of this chapter to subsequent phases of development. The town manager or his designee may require that additional requirements be incorporated into the subsequent phases of development to protect the health, safety and welfare of the general public as well as to ensure compliance with applicable federal, state and local regulations. 
                  4.  Exempt activities. The following activities are exempt from this chapter: 
                  A.  New development or redevelopment that involves the creation, addition or replacement of less than 5,000 square feet of impervious cover and that involves less than one acre of other land disturbing activities; 
                  B.  Individual single-family or duplex residential lots that are not part of a subdivision or phased development project that is otherwise subject to this chapter; 
                  C.  Additions or modifications to existing single-family or duplex residential structures; 
                  D.  Projects that are exclusively for agricultural or silvicultural activities within areas zoned for these agricultural and silvicultural use; 
                  E.  Maintenance and repairs of any green infrastructure or stormwater management practices deemed necessary by the town manager (or his designee); 
                  F.  Any part of a land development project that was approved by the director or their designee prior to the adoption of this chapter; and 
                  G.  Redevelopment that constitutes the replacement of the original square footage of impervious cover and original acreage of other land development activity when the original development is wholly or partially lost due to natural disaster or other acts of God occurring after (2/08/2012). 
                  5.  Stormwater management manual. The Town of Thunderbolt will utilize the standards, criteria, and information presented in the latest edition of the Coastal Stormwater Supplement (CSS), the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual (GSMM), local design and construction standards, and any relevant local addenda, for the proper implementation of this chapter. These references may be updated and expanded periodically, based on improvements in science, engineering, monitoring, and local experience. 
                  6.  Local stormwater design criteria. The Town of Thunderbolt may furnish additional policy, criteria and information including specifications and standards, for the proper implementation of the requirements of this chapter. This information will serve to supplement and/or clarify information set forth in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual and Coastal Stormwater Supplement. 
                  This information may include a list of acceptable stormwater treatment practices, including the specific design criteria and operation and maintenance requirements for each stormwater practice. This information may be updated and expanded from time to time, at the discretion of the Town of Thunderbolt, based on improvements in engineering, science, monitoring and local maintenance experience. Stormwater treatment practices that are designed and constructed in accordance with these design and sizing criteria will be presumed to meet the minimum water quality performance standards during the design and permitting phase of a land development project. 
                  Sec. 5-320. - Stormwater management plan requirements. 
                  1.  No owner or developer shall undertake any non-exempt development activity without first meeting the requirements of this chapter and receiving approval for the proposed land development activity from the Town of Thunderbolt. Unless specifically exempted by this chapter or granted a waiver by the town manager or his designee from specific requirements, any owner or developer proposing a development project shall submit to the Town of Thunderbolt the required information in a format specified by Thunderbolt. The following items shall accompany the submittal package: 
                  A.  Stormwater management concept plan in accordance with subsection (2) of this section; 
                  B.  A record of a consultation meeting, if held, in accordance with subsection (3) of this section;

                  E.  Permit application and plan review fees in accordance with subsection (7) of this section; and 
                  F.  Performance bond in accordance with subsection (8) of this section, if applicable. 
                  If an owner or developer has been granted a waiver by the town manager or his designee, written documentation pertaining to the specific items that will be submitted as well as those that will not be submitted must be provided to the town at the onset of the project. 
                  2.  Stormwater management concept plan. Prior to the submittal of a stormwater management design plan, inspection and maintenance agreement and plan, and permit application, the landowner or developer shall submit to the Town of Thunderbolt for review and approval, a preliminary concept plan describing, in general, how stormwater runoff through and from the development will be conveyed and managed. The stormwater management concept plan shall utilize, to the maximum extent practical, better site planning and design techniques and low impact development practices to reduce stormwater runoff rates, volumes, and pollutant loads and reduce the site's impact on the watershed. 
                  The submittal should include the following components: 
                  A.  Project narrative. The project narrative shall include a vicinity map, the common address of the development site and a legal description of the development site.

                  6.  Proposed conservation areas; 
                  7.  Proposed low impact development and stormwater management practices; 
                  8.  Proposed stormwater drainage infrastructure including both closed systems (e.g., inlets, man holes, pipes) and opens systems (e.g., canals, ditches.) 
                  F.  Post-construction stormwater management system narrative. The post-construction stormwater management system narrative shall include information about how post-construction stormwater runoff will be managed on the development site, including a list of the low impact development and stormwater management practices that will be used. It shall also include calculations showing how initial estimates of the post-construction stormwater management criteria that apply to the development project were obtained, including information about the existing and proposed conditions of each of the drainage areas found on the development site (e.g., size, soil types, land cover characteristics.) 
                  3.  Consultation meeting. All applicants are encouraged to attend a consultation meeting with the Town of Thunderbolt to discuss the proposed development project, the stormwater management concept plan and the approach that will be used to satisfy the post-construction stormwater management and site planning and design criteria that apply to the development site. This consultation meeting should take place in advance of submittal of the stormwater management concept plan, for the purposes of verifying site conditions and the feasibility of the stormwater management concept plan. 
                  4.  Stormwater management design plan. Subsequent to approval of the stormwater management concept plan and prior to completion of formal site design, the owner or developer shall submit to the Town of Thunderbolt for review and approval, a stormwater management design plan that details how stormwater runoff through and downstream from the development will be conveyed and managed. The stormwater management design plan shall detail how post-development stormwater runoff will be controlled or managed and how the proposed project will meet the requirements of this chapter, including the post-construction stormwater management criteria set forth in section 5-324. The stormwater management design plan must be approved prior to approval of the preliminary plat and commencement of land disturbing activities. The stormwater management design plan shall include all of the information contained in the stormwater management concept plan, plus:

The maintenance bond shall be an amount equal to 25 percent of the initial bond amount posted for the construction of the stormwater management system on the development site. 
                  Sec. 5-321. - Compliance through off-site stormwater management practices or direct discharge into open tidal waters. 
                  All stormwater management design plans shall include on-site stormwater management practices, unless arrangements are made with the town manager or his designee to manage post-construction stormwater runoff in an off-site or regional stormwater management practice. The off-site or regional stormwater management practice must be located on property legally dedicated to that purpose, be designed and sized to meet the post-construction stormwater management criteria set forth in section 5-324 of this article, provide a level of stormwater quality and quantity control that is equal to or greater than that which would be provided by on-site green infrastructure and stormwater management practices and have an associated inspection and maintenance plan agreement. In addition, appropriate stormwater management practices shall be installed, where necessary, to protect properties and drainage channels that are located between the development site and the location of the off-site or regional stormwater management practice. 
                  To be eligible for compliance through the use of off-site stormwater management practices, the applicant must submit a stormwater management plan to the Town of Thunderbolt that shows the adequacy of the off-site or regional stormwater management practice and demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the town manager or his designee, that the off-site or regional stormwater management practice will not result in the following impacts: 
                  i.  Increased threat of flood damage or endangerment to public health or safety; 
                  ii.  Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams and other structures; 
                  iii.  Accelerated stream bank or streambed erosion or siltation; 
                  iv.  Degradation of in-stream biological functions or habitat; or 
                  v.  Water quality impairment in violation of state water quality standards and/or violation of any other state or federal regulations. 
                  In addition, the requirement for on-site stormwater management practices can be waived if one of the two conditions stipulated below can be met to the satisfaction of the town manager or his designee: (1) the development directly discharges into open tidal waters without passing through the town's municipal separate storm sewer system, or (2) provisions are made to provide for a drainage system with adequate capacity to carry site runoff flows to open tidal waters. The town will require the developer or owner to coordinate this request with adjacent or downstream property owners and/or local governments. 
                  Where direct discharge are requested into tidal areas, the department of natural resources and/or the corp of engineers approval is required before the stormwater management plan can be approved. New drainage outfalls into marshlands, tidal waters, or protected wetlands shall be approved by the corps of engineers and/or Georgia Department of Natural Resources. Any modification to existing outfalls that have inverts below +5.3 MSL or any modification that results in the invert being lower than mean high tide, shall be approved by the various state and federal agencies having jurisdiction. Tide control structures shall be installed where the invert elevation of the first structure is below mean high tide. 
                  Sec. 5-322. - Variances from stormwater management requirements. 
                  1.  Criteria for variances for providing stormwater management. The town manager or his designee may grant a variance from requirements of this chapter if exceptional circumstances applicable to a site exist such that strict adherence to the provisions of the ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship and will not fulfill the intent of the ordinance. The town manager or his designee may grant a variance from requirements of this chapter if the proposed development activity will not: 
                  A.  Increase in rate, volume, or concentration of runoff to the existing downstream storm sewer system; 
                  B.  Increase the base flood elevation upstream or downstream; 
                  C.  Have a negative impact on any wetland, watercourse, or water body; or 
                  D.  Contribute to degradation of water quality. 
                  A written request for a variance shall be required and shall state the specific variance sought and the reasons a variance should be granted. The request shall be accompanied by all necessary supporting data and provided in a format that is deemed acceptable by the town. The town manager or his designee will conduct a review of the variance request within ten working days of receiving the request. 
                  2.  Mitigation requirements for variances. Where compliance is waived and a variance is issued, the applicant will satisfy the minimum requirements by meeting one to the mitigation measures selected by the director. Mitigation measures may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
                  A.  The purchase and donation of privately owned lands, or the grant of an easement to be dedicated for preservation and/or reforestation. 
                  B.  The creation of a stormwater management facility or other drainage improvements on previously developed properties, public or private, that currently lack stormwater management facilities designed and constructed in accordance with the purposes and standards of this article. 
                  C.  Monetary contributions (fee-in-lieu) to fund stormwater management activities. 
                  Sec. 5-323. - Fee in lieu of stormwater management practices. 
                  Where the Town of Thunderbolt issues a variances from all or part of the minimum stormwater management requirements, or where adequate stormwater facilities are provide through off-site stormwater management practices or direct discharge into open tidal waters, the applicant may be required to pay a fee in an amount as determined by the town. 
                  When an applicant obtains a waiver of the required stormwater management, the monetary contribution required shall be in accordance with a fee schedule (unless the developer and the Town of Thunderbolt agree on a greater alternate contribution) established by the Town of Thunderbolt Council. All of the monetary contributions shall be credited to the stormwater management program, and shall be made by the developer prior to the approval of any development activity. 
                  Sec. 5-324. - Post-construction stormwater management criteria. 
                  All development and redevelopment sites shall utilize structural and nonstructural stormwater management practices to control and minimize the increased stormwater runoff rates, velocities, volumes, and pollutant loads caused by land development in accordance with the criteria presented below. Better site planning and design techniques and low impact development practices and nonstructural stormwater controls should be used to the maximum extent practical to reduce runoff rates, velocities, volumes, and pollutant loads and the site's impact on the watershed. Such techniques and practices include, but are not limited to, conservation and/or restoration of natural areas, such as forests, wetlands, and riparian buffers, minimization and/or disconnection of impervious surfaces, and small-scale distributed stormwater management practices, such as rain gardens, pervious pavement, and stormwater planters, that intercept and treat or otherwise manage stormwater runoff close to its source. 
                  For structural and nonstructural stormwater management practices not reduction rates have not been provided, the effectiveness of the structural or nonstructural stormwater management practice must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the town manager or his designee before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the post-construction stormwater management criteria, the town manager or his designee may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or due to increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the development or redevelopment site in question. 
                  The following criteria shall apply to all land development activities and stormwater management design plans, unless otherwise provided for in this chapter: 
                  1.  Runoff reduction. The stormwater runoff volume generated by the runoff reduction storm event, as defined in the April 2009 edition of the CSS to the GSMM, shall be reduced on-site to the maximum extent practicable in order to help maintain pre-development site hydrology and help protect local aquatic resources from several indirect impacts of the land development process, including decreased groundwater recharge, decreased base flow, and degraded water quality. In general, a stormwater management system is presumed to comply with these criteria if: 
                  A.  It includes green infrastructure practices that provide for the interception, evapotranspiration, infiltration or capture and reuse of stormwater runoff, that have been selected, designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with the information presented in the latest edition of the CSS to the GSMM and any applicable Town of Thunderbolt Design Criteria; and 
                  B.  It is designed to provide the amount of stormwater runoff reduction specified in the April 2009 edition of the CSS to the GSMM. 
                  The town manager or his designee may vary the amount of stormwater runoff reduction needed to satisfy this criteria on development sites that are considered to be stormwater hotspots or that have site characteristics or constraints, such as high groundwater, impermeable soils, contaminated soils or confined groundwater aquifer recharge areas, that prevent the use of green infrastructure practices that provide for the interception, evapotranspiration, infiltration or capture and reuse of stormwater runoff. When seeking a variance in the amount of stormwater runoff reduction that needs to be provided in order to satisfy these criteria, applicants are encouraged to: 
                  A.  Use green infrastructure practices that provide for the interception, evapotranspiration, infiltration or capture and reuse of stormwater runoff, to provide the maximum amount of stormwater runoff reduction specified in the GSMM, the April 2009 edition of the CSS to the GSMM and the Town of Thunderbolt drainage design criteria; and 
                  B.  Provide adequate documentation to Thunderbolt to show that no additional runoff reducing green infrastructure practices can be used on the development site and that the reduction provided is all that can be provided in a practical manner. 
                  2.  Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated by the designated design storm or storms from a new development or redevelopment site shall be adequately treated before discharge unless otherwise directed by the town manager or his designee. Stormwater management systems should be designed to accomplish the following for each site as a minimum: 
                  A.  Utilize applicable practices in an effort to reduce, at a minimum, the stormwater runoff volume generated by the 0.6 inch rainfall event (and the first 0.6 inches of all larger rainfall events) on the development site; 
                  B.  Capture and treat any of the stormwater runoff generated by the 1.2 inch storm event (and the first 1.2 inches of all larger events) that is not reduced under item 1 above such that: 
                  1.  Eighty percent of the total suspended solids (TSS) loading are removed; 
                  2.  Nitrogen and bacteria loadings are reduced to the maximum extent practicable; and 
                  3.  Stormwater runoff pollutant reduction efforts comply with other watershed-specific, service area-specific or site-specific water quality requirements, if applicable. 
                  It is presumed that a stormwater management system design complies with these criteria if the proposed stormwater controls are selected, designed, constructed and maintained according to GSMM and the CSS. Additional, water quality requirements may be specified for hotspot land uses and activities. 
                  3.  Aquatic resource protection. In order to protect local aquatic resources from several other negative impacts of the land development process, including complete loss or destruction, stream channel enlargement and increased salinity fluctuations, applicants shall provide aquatic resource protection in accordance with the information provided in the April 2009 edition of the CSS to the GSMM. 
                  Aquatic resources protection shall be provided for each site through management and extended detention of the one-year 24-hour storm event released over a period of 24 hours to reduce the frequency and duration of channel forming events. 
                  Velocity control and energy dissipation measures shall be installed at all new and existing stormwater outfalls in accordance with criteria and guidance provided in section 4.5 of the GSMM (volume 2) and applicable sections of the CSS. 
                  4.  Overbank flood protection. All stormwater management systems shall be designed to control the post-development peak discharge generated by the overbank flood protection storm event, as defined in the latest edition of the GSMM, the CSS and any local stormwater design criteria, to prevent an increase in the frequency and magnitude of damaging overbank flooding. A stormwater management system complies with this requirement if it provides overbank flood protection in accordance with the criteria and information provided in the latest edition of the GSMM, the CSS and any local stormwater design criteria. 
                  The town manager or his designee may modify or waive this criteria on development sites where both the on-site and downstream stormwater conveyance systems are designed to safely convey the peak discharge generated by the overbank flood protection storm event to a receiving stream, tidal creek or other aquatic resource without causing additional downstream flooding or other environmental impacts, such as stream channel enlargement or degradation of habitat. 
                  5.  Extreme flood protection. All stormwater management systems shall be designed to control and/or safely convey the post-development peak discharge generated by the extreme flood protection storm event, as defined in the latest edition of the GSMM, the CSS and any local stormwater design criteria, to protect downstream properties from flood damage, maintain the boundaries of existing floodplains, and protect the physical integrity of downstream stormwater conveyance features, management practices, and flood control facilities. A stormwater management system complies with this requirement if it provides extreme flood protection in accordance with the criteria and information provided in the latest edition of the GSMM, the CSS and any local stormwater design criteria. 
                  The town manager or his designee may modify or waive this criteria on development sites where both the on-site and downstream stormwater conveyance systems are designed to safely convey the peak discharge generated by the extreme flood protection storm event to a receiving stream, tidal creek or other aquatic resource without causing additional downstream flooding or other environmental impacts, such as stream channel enlargement or degradation of habitat. 
                  6.  Redevelopment criteria. Land development that qualifies as redevelopment shall meet one of the following criteria: 
                  A.  Reduce impervious cover. Reduce existing site impervious cover by at least 20 percent in an effort to mimic and/or restore the natural hydrology of the site to the maximum extent practical. 
                  B.  Provide stormwater management. Manage the stormwater runoff from at least 20 percent of the site's existing impervious cover and any new impervious cover in accordance with the post-construction stormwater management criteria outlined in subsections (1) through (6) of this section using stormwater management practices designed in accordance with the standards, criteria, and information presented in the latest edition of the GSMM, the CSS and the Local Stormwater Design Manual. 
                  C.  Provide off-site stormwater management. Provide a level of stormwater quality and quantity control that is equal to or greater than that which would be provided by on-site stormwater management practices, in accordance with section 5-321 of this article. 
                  D.  Combination of measures. Any combination of (A) through (C) above that is acceptable to the town manager or his designee. 
                  7.  Structural stormwater management practices. All structural stormwater management practices shall be selected, designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with the standards, criteria, and information presented in the latest edition of the GSMM, the CSS and the Local Stormwater Design Manual. Applicants shall consult the latest edition of the GSMM, the CSS and the Local Stormwater Design Manual for guidance on selecting structural stormwater management practices that can be used to satisfy the post-construction stormwater management criteria. 
                  8.  Nonstructural stormwater management practices. The use of nonstructural stormwater management practices, including better site planning and design techniques, and low impact development practices, is encouraged to preserve and/or replicate the pre-development hydrology of a development or redevelopment site, reduce a site's impact on the watershed, and minimize reliance on structural stormwater management practices. The use of nonstructural stormwater management practices may, at the discretion of the town manager or his designee, allow for a reduction in stormwater runoff volume as a means of complying with the post-construction stormwater management criteria outlined in this section. The nonstructural stormwater management practices that qualify for this credit, and procedures for applying and calculating the runoff reduction provided by these nonstructural stormwater management practices, is provided in the latest edition of the GSMM and the CSS. 
                  9.  Stormwater conveyance systems. Stormwater conveyance systems, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutters, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters, shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining development and redevelopment sites and/or public right-of-ways. Stormwater conveyance systems that are designed to convey stormwater runoff from more than one parcel shall meet the following requirements: 
                  A.  Methods used to calculate stormwater runoff rates and volumes shall be in accordance with the latest edition of the GSMM, the CSS and the local stormwater design criteria; 
                  B.  All culverts, pipe systems, and open channel flow systems shall be sized in accordance with the stormwater management design plan using the methods included in the latest edition of the GSMM, the CSS and any local stormwater design criteria; and 
                  C.  Planning and design of stormwater conveyance systems shall be in accordance with the criteria and specifications found in the latest edition of the GSMM, the CSS and any local stormwater design criteria. 
                  Sec. 5-325. - Construction inspection of stormwater management systems. 
                  1.  Notice of construction commencement. The applicant must notify the town manager or his designee before the commencement of construction. In addition, the applicant must notify the town manager or his designee in advance of construction of critical components of the stormwater management practices shown on the approved stormwater management design plan. The town manager or his designee may, at his discretion, issue verbal or written authorization to proceed with critical construction steps, such as installation of permanent stormwater management practices based on stabilization of the drainage area and other factors. 
                  2.  Inspections during construction. Periodic inspections of the stormwater management practices shown on the approved stormwater management design plan shall be conducted by staff or representatives of the director during construction. Construction inspections shall utilize the approved stormwater management design plan for establishing compliance with the provisions of this chapter. All inspections shall be documented in written reports that contain the following information: 
                  A.  The date and location of the inspection;

                  D.  Violations of the approved stormwater management design plan; 
                  E.  Any other variations from the approved stormwater management plan; and 
                  F.  Deadline to correct noted violations. 
                  If any violations are found, the applicant shall be notified in writing about the nature of the violation and the remedial measures that are required to bring the action or inaction into compliance with the approved stormwater management design plan. In the event that the remedial measures described in such notice have not been completed by the date set forth in the notice, any one or more of the enforcement actions outlined in article XI of this chapter may be taken against the applicant. 
                  3.  Final inspection and as built plans. Subsequent to the final installation and stabilization of all permanent stormwater management practices shown on the approved stormwater management design plan and before the issuance of a certificate of occupancy the applicant is responsible for certifying that the project has been completed in accordance with the approved stormwater management design plan and submitting "as built" plans, in hard copy and geo-referenced, electronic format acceptable to the town, for all permanent stormwater management practices shown on the approved stormwater management design plan. The "as built" plans must show the final design specifications for all structural and nonstructural stormwater management practices and must be certified by a licensed landscape architect, professional surveyor, or professional engineer. A final inspection shall be conducted by the staff or representatives of the director to confirm the accuracy of the "as built" plans. A final inspection is required before any performance bond or other guarantee can be released. 
                  4.  Landscaping and stabilization requirements. Any area of land from which the natural vegetative cover has been either partially or wholly cleared or removed by development activities shall be revegetated within ten days from the substantial completion of such clearing and construction. The following criteria shall apply to revegetation efforts: 
                  A.  Reseeding must be done with an annual or perennial cover crop accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent of sufficient coverage to control erosion until such time as the cover crop is established over 90 percent of the seeded area. 
                  B.  Replanting with native woody and herbaceous vegetation must be accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent of sufficient coverage to control erosion until the plantings are established and are capable of controlling erosion. 
                  C.  Any area of revegetation must exhibit survival of a minimum of 75 percent of the cover crop throughout the year immediately following revegetation. Revegetation must be repeated in successive years until the minimum 75 percent survival for one year is achieved. 
                  In addition to the above requirements, a landscaping plan that complies with the applicable provisions of 5-305 Tree Protection Ordinance must be submitted with the final stormwater management plan describing the vegetative stabilization and management techniques to be used at a site after construction is completed in accordance with other such requirements in the Town of Thunderbolt Code of Ordinances. This plan will explain not only how the site will be stabilized after construction, but who will be responsible for the maintenance of vegetation at the site and what practices will be employed to ensure that adequate vegetative cover is preserved. 
                  Sec. 5-326. - Ongoing inspection and maintenance of stormwater management systems. 
                  1.  Maintenance responsibility.

                  B.  Measurements, tests and analyses performed by the town or required of any discharger to the MS4 shall be in accordance with the town's NPDES Phase I MS4 permit, unless another method is approved by the town manager or his designee. 
                  C.  All inspections should be documented in written reports that contain the following information:

The responsible party shall make and maintain records of all inspections, maintenance, and repairs, and shall retain the records for a minimum of five years. These records shall be made available to the town manager or his designee during inspections and at other reasonable times upon request of the town. 
                  4.  Failure to maintain.

                  5.  Cost of abatement of the violation. Within 30 days after abatement of the violation, the owner of the property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of the assessment within 30 days. If the amount due is not paid within a timely manner as determined by the decision of the reviewing authority or by the expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment. 
                  6.  Injunctive relief. It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this article.

                  7.  Violations deemed a public nuisance. In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any article is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the violator's expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel the cessation of such nuisance may be taken. 
                  Sec. 5-328. - Penalties.

In the event the owner, applicant, or other responsible person fails to correct the violation by the date set forth in said notice, the director may take any one or more of the following actions or impose any one or more of the following penalties. 
                  1.  Stop work order. The director may issue a stop work order that shall be served on the owner, applicant, or other responsible person.

                  ARTICLE V. - TREES 

                  Sec. 5-329. - [Master plan governing tree maintenance, planting, and removal.] 
                  This chapter, along with the Thunderbolt Urban Forest Five-Year Plan and a Standards and Specifications document that outlines requirements for tree care and management, constitute the town's master plan governing tree maintenance, planting, and removal except as set forth in section 5-329. (Adopted 1/09/2013) 
                  A.  Purpose . It is the intention of this chapter to promote the preservation of trees on residential, commercial, and waterfront property and to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare by providing regulations for the planting, maintenance, and removal of trees within the Town of Thunderbolt. 
                  Trees are an integral part of our community and the ecological systems in which the community exists. They provide significant economic, social and ecological benefits. They are as necessary as water, roads, and energy to sustaining healthy communities. 
                  The collection of trees on both public and private properties in a community is called an urban forest. In the urban forest, a single tree may be as important as a patch of forest remnant. To avoid losing this valuable resource, we must set into place, laws to preserve existing trees while we plant and maintain new ones to sustain the urban forest system. 
                  B.  Applicability . 
                  1.  Public property. The Town of Thunderbolt has full power and authority over all trees, plants, and shrubs located within street rights-of-way, parks and public places of the town. No person shall plant, remove, cut above the ground or disturb any tree on any street, park, or public right-of-way without first filing an application and procuring a permit from the town. The person receiving this permit shall abide by the standards set forth in this chapter. 
                  2.  Private property. The Town of Thunderbolt has full power and authority over all trees located on private property that constitute a hazard or a nuisance; and to any tree deemed to be a specimen tree whether on public or private property as described herein. The definition of specimen tree shall be the same as set forth in chapter 5, section 5-329.1D(1) of the town's ordinances. The Town of Thunderbolt has the authority to enter onto private property wherein there is located a tree that is suspected to be a public nuisance or hazard and to order its removal, if necessary. A nuisance or hazard is defined as any tree with an infectious disease, or insect problem or is dead or dying. 
                  C.  Responsibility and authority. There is hereby created and established a Town of Thunderbolt Tree Commission which shall consist of six members—five residents and one supervisory-level/or elected official—appointed by the mayor with the approval of the town council. Members of the board shall serve without compensation. The terms of tree commission appointees shall be three years, except that the terms of two of the members appointed to the first commission shall be for only one year and the terms of two members of the first commission shall be two years. In the event that a vacancy shall occur during the term of any member, his or her successor shall be appointed for the unexpired portion of the term. 
                  It shall be the responsibility of this commission to promulgate the urban forest five-year plan rules, regulations, standards and specifications, for the care, conservation, pruning, planting, replanting, removal or disposition of trees and shrubs in parks, along streets and in other public areas. Such rules, regulations, standards and specifications shall be presented to the mayor and council for approval and adoption and upon adoption shall be considered a part of this chapter. 
                  D.  Tree protection. A tree inventory on public property will be conducted under the supervision of the Thunderbolt Tree Commission. The purpose will be to identify all trees on public lands and to protect trees of historic value or unusual qualities (called specimen trees). In addition to specimen trees as defined in chapter V, section 5-329, a tree may qualify as a specimen tree if it is associated with a historic event or person, or is part of a scenic enhancement. 
                  E.  Permits . Permits are required for all tree removal on public property. This will assure that no entity may damage, prune, or remove a tree from public property in the Town of Thunderbolt, without the written permission of a town designee. Residents are not charged for tree removal permits which may be obtained from the Thunderbolt town offices. Permits are also required for removal or trimming of specimen trees or trees that constitute a nuisance or hazard on private property. 
                  No person except employees of the Town of Thunderbolt or a contractor hired by the town may trim or remove trees protected by this chapter without first obtaining a permit from the town. 
                  F.  Licensing . It shall be unlawful for any contractor to engage, without a permit, in the (1) planting, cutting, trimming, pruning, removing, spraying, or otherwise treating trees, plants or shrubs within the Town of Thunderbolt's parks or rights-of-way or (2) cutting, trimming, or removing specimen trees or trees constituting a hazard or nuisance on private property. 
                  G.  Insurance . Before any permits shall be issued, each applicant shall first file evidence of possession of worker compensation and liability insurance in the minimum amounts of $1,000,000.00 for bodily injury or death and $100,000.00 property damage indemnifying the town or any person injured or damaged resulting from the pursuit of such endeavor as herein described. 
                  H.  Enforcement . The Town of Thunderbolt Code Enforcement Officer or other officer of the town as designated by the town administrator or the mayor and council shall have the power to enforce rules, regulations and terms of this chapter. 
                  I.  Penalties . Any person who violates any provision of this chapter or who fails to comply with any notice issued pursuant to provisions of the ordinance, upon being found guilty of violation, shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $500.00 for each offense. Each day during which any violation of the provisions of this chapter shall occur or continue shall be a separate offense. If, as a result of the violation of any provision of this chapter, the injury, mutilation, or death of a tree, shrub, or other plant located on town-owned property is caused, the cost of repair or replacement, or the appraised dollar value of such tree, shrub, or other plant, shall be borne by the party in violation. The value of trees and shrubs shall be determined in accordance with the latest revision of "A Guide to the Professional Evaluation of Landscape Trees, Specimen Shrubs, and Evergreens" as published by the International Society of Arboriculture. All funds collected for violation of the Thunderbolt tree ordinance will be designated solely for the planting of additional trees or shrubs. 
                  J.  Miscellaneous . If any section, clause, sentence, or phrase of this chapter is held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, then said holding shall in no way effect the validity of the remaining portions of this chapter. 
                  Note: For the "Standards and Specifications and 5-Year Plan," see the appendix to town ordinances or clerk of council.

                  Trees are recognized for their historical importance as well as in shading, cooling, noise and wind reduction, soil erosion prevention, oxygen production, dust filtration, carbon dioxide absorption, and aesthetic and economic enhancement of all real property. Their contribution to the general well-being and quality of life for the citizens of Thunderbolt is recognized and valued. 
                  Therefore, the town deems it necessary and in the interest of public health, safety, and welfare to enact and enforce an ordinance for the preservation of trees and to prevent the indiscriminate removal of trees and reduction of canopy cover within the town. 
                  A.  Purpose .

                  (3)  Protect trees during construction whenever possible in order to enhance the quality of life within the Town of Thunderbolt. 
                  B.  Applicability . 
                  (1)  The terms and provisions of the tree protection ordinance and these standards shall apply to any activity, which requires the issuance of a development permit.

                  D.  General criteria for the determination of specimen trees or stands of trees. 
                  (1)  Specimen tree. 
                  (a)  Any tree in fair or better condition, which equals or exceeds the following diameter sizes: 
                  i.  36" dbh (three feet diameter breast height)—Large hardwoods such as oaks, hickories, yellow poplars, sweet gums, etc. 
                  ii.  30" dbh—Large softwoods such as pines, deodar cedars, etc. 
                  iii.  4" dbh—Small trees such as dogwoods, redbuds, sourwoods, etc. 
                  (b)  A tree in fair or better condition must meet the following minimum standards: 
                  i.  A life expectancy of greater than 15 years. 
                  ii.  A structurally sound trunk. 
                  (c)  A lesser-sized tree can be considered a specimen tree if it is a rare or unusual species, of exceptional or unique quality, or of historical significance. 
                  (d)  A lesser size tree can be considered a specimen tree if it is specifically used by a builder, developer, or design professional as a focal point in a landscape project. 
                  (2)  Specimen tree stands. A contiguous grouping of trees, which has been determined to be of high value. Determination is based upon the following criteria: 
                  a.  A relatively mature, even-aged stand. 
                  b.  A stand with purity of species composition or of a rare or unusual nature.

                  (3)  Critical root zone (CRZ) . The area beneath a tree which must be left undisturbed in order to preserve a sufficient root mass to give a tree a reasonable chance of survival. The CRZ will typically be represented by a concentric circle centering on the tree's trunk with a radius equal in feet to one and one-half times the number of inches of the trunk diameter. Example: The CRZ radius of a 20-inch diameter tree is 30 feet. 
                  E.  Removal of trees—Conditions and exceptions. 
                  (1)  Tree removal shall be disallowed in the following circumstances: 
                  (a)  Soil erosion or runoff problems will result due to topography, soil type, or proximity to flood plain or river protection areas; and the removal will substantially alter the existing soils adversely with regard to runoff and erosion. Information submitted by the town's public works staff member or other town environmental staff may be used in this evaluation. 
                  (b)  Specimen trees are located on site and cannot be adequately protected or replaced. Additionally, removal may be disallowed if reasonable accommodations can be made to alter the proposed project to save specimen trees and have not been made. 
                  1.  When removal of a specimen tree cannot be avoided, newly planted (two-inch or greater) or additional preserved trees (of a similar type, i.e., hardwood, softwood, small tree) not meeting the size requirement for specimen trees shall be provided in an amount that equals the total inches of removed specimen trees. 
                  (Example: A 36" and a 40" hardwood is proposed for removal. 76" total inches of planted or additional preservation of non-specimen trees shall be required. This could be accomplished by either planting 76" worth of two-inch or greater similar type trees, by preserving 76" of trees of a similar type that are not considered specimen due to being under the size requirement, or a combination of planting and additional tree preservation.) 
                  (c)  Property degradation. The removal will have a significant adverse effect on property values of any adjoining property. 
                  (d)  Pruning . Any substantial amount of pruning which results in unsightly appearance or predisposing the tree to pathogens, reducing the health and vigor of the tree. 
                  (2)  Exceptions . Tree removal from a site may be allowed if: 
                  (a)  The tree is located in an area where a structure or improvement will be placed and the tree cannot be relocated on the site because of age, type or size of tree. 
                  (b)  The tree is diseased or structurally unsound. 
                  (c)  The tree is injured and/or poses an imminent danger. 
                  (d)  The tree interferes with existing utility service. 
                  (e)  The tree creates an unsafe vision clearance for vehicular movement. 
                  (3)  Trees must be relocated or replaced on site in accordance with the provisions of the Thunderbolt zoning ordinance. Prior to approval of the tree protection plan, the arborist shall require relocation or replacement of each tree being moved or removed on the site to be supplemented with additional trees to establish within the tree protection zone a minimum of one tree per 500 square feet of minimum required open space. 
                  (4)  Existing trees. Any existing trees of not less than two inches dbh left in good growing condition on the property shall be counted toward the minimum number required. All replacement trees will be maintained properly to ensure their survivability. 
                  (5)  Debris removed. All debris from trees cut or substantially damaged shall be removed from the site in a timely fashion, including the removal of any portion of the tree stump above the original natural grade or elevation of land, unless accepted by the arborist for a specific reason such as, but not limited to, unusually large size or age. 
                  (6)  It is required that all reasonable efforts be made to save specimen trees. Reasonable effort shall include, but not be limited to, alteration of building design; alternate location of building, parking area, water retention drainage pipes; or relocation of utilities. 
                  F.  Breach of ordinance. Any person(s) who violate any provision of this chapter or who fails to comply with any notice issued may be subject to legal prosecution resulting in a maximum fine of: 
                  $200.00 First offense. 
                  $300.00 Second offense. 
                  $500.00 Third offense. 
                  Each day during which any violation of the provision of this chapter shall occur or continue shall be a separate offence and will be tried accordingly.

                  Sec. 15-710.07. - Stormwater management requirements. 
                  (a)  Impervious site coverage. No commercial, industrial, office, hotel/motel, multifamily residential, institutional use, mobile home park, will be approved which contains more than 65 percent site coverage by impervious surfaces unless site specific soil types, percolation rates and seasonal high groundwater table conditions are adequate so as to permit a greater percent impervious coverage. Permanent on-site water surface areas will be considered as impervious material surfaces for this site coverage calculation. 
                  The Soil Conservation Service (SCS) has identified different soil types into four groups (called Hydrologic Soil Groups) according to their run-off producing characteristics. Vegetation and slope are not a consideration. These groups will be used for design ratios in accordance with the following table: 

                   
                  Applications for projects incorporating a 65/35 ratio of impervious to pervious surface coverage do not have to submit site specific soil data; but, may rely to the general soil survey from the SCS for Chatham Counties. Applications seeking greater that 65 percent impervious site coverage must include site specific certified soil data, annual high groundwater table levels, soil percolation rate and supporting calculations performed by a soil expert meeting the qualifications set forth below. Soil test results submitted shall be used to determine the allowable surface coverage ratio in accordance with the table set forth herein. 
                  (b)  Soil expert qualification. To be qualified as an expert in soils, their classifications, their physical make-up and their hydrological properties, an individual must be a Georgia licensed geologist or a Georgia licensed soil scientist. 
                  Sec. 15-710.08. - Drainage design standards, methodology and criteria. 
                  (a)  On-site stormwater control. All applications for development will provide for on-site retention or detention (dry or wet) for the differential between pre-development and post-development computed peak runoff. The site shall be the total area of development, including non-contiguous lands if part of a non-contiguous planned unit development (PUD) application, and shall be owned in fee simple or have perpetual cross easements for drainage purpose. 
                  (b)  Methodology . Two hydrological methods for computing surface runoff are hereby adopted: "The Rational Method" and "U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service (SCS) Technical Release No. 55 (TR-55), entitled Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds." 
                  Alternative computer models may be utilized if such computer model have found wide spread acceptance and meets the approval of the town's engineer. 
                  (c)  Drainage design criteria. The following design criteria shall be used for either methodology utilized for computation: 
                  Design storm—The design storm for town shall be the ten-year frequency, 24-hour, antecedent condition II for all on-site roads, swales, drainage structures and ditches, etc. The design storm for all detention basins, retention basin, outfall structures and outfall pipe shall be the 50-year frequency, 24-hour storm event. 
                  (d)  General requirements. An overall map of the drainage area with basin area, length, and slope information keyed to the drainage calculations. 
                  The calculations shall clearly show how the time of concentrations was determined. 
                  Pipe sizing calculations shall be checked for inlet and outlet control. Maximum headwater and tailwater conditions should be provided. 
                  Flood plain elevations and zones for the FEMA 100-year storm shall be shown on the construction plans. 
                  Where FEMA flood elevation have not been determined; the engineer shall provide such elevations based on his study and set the finish floor elevations one foot above the 100-year flood elevation or the peak elevation backwater of the 100-year storm event within the subdivision. 
                  The use of wetlands for storage and purifying runoff is strongly encouraged. However, care must be taken not to overload their capacity, thereby harming the wetlands and transitional vegetation. Priority wetlands identified on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Wetlands Inventory Map, should not be injured by the construction of detention ponds in them or sufficiently near to deprive them of required runoff or to lower their normal water table elevations. Adjacent detention ponds that benefit retention of normal wetlands water table elevations are acceptable. If a retention or detention pond is going to be located near priority wetland, the applicant will provide data showing that impacts will not be detrimental to the wetland. 
                  Where possible to increase the length of shoreline, thus offering more space for growth of littoral vegetation for filtering purposes. 
                  Maximum basin side slopes shall be 3:1, except where soil conditions require flatter slopes. 
                  Wet detention basin shall have a permanent pool depth of not less than four feet to reduce bottom vegetation growth. 
                  Dry basin must be designed with access to allow for efficient maintenance of the basin bottom and side slopes. 
                  Detention and retention ponds shall be designed to provide at least one foot of vertical detention storage volume for runoff above the proposed dry weather water level design elevation. 
                  Major drainage canals shall not be used for storage. 
                  Use of rectangular weir outlets will be allowed only where this weir will provide better outlet control needed for a given situation than that provided by a V-notched weir. V-shaped of V-notched weir outlets are recommended to achieve detention storage. Use of innovative outlet structures such as pipe-culvert combinations, perforated riser pipe, or special graduated opening outlet control boxes, is encouraged as ways of reproducing pre-development runoff conditions. 
                  Design data for storage volume and detention outlet requirements shall be submitted and approved by the town's engineer. 
                  Detention and retention ponds shall be designed for ten-year sediment load before the one-foot storage volume requirement is included. 
                  The principal outlet must convey the design peak flow without emergency overflow. 
                  Uses of concrete weirs or standpipes are preferred over undersize pipes. Restrictor plates are prohibited. 
                  Where cleared site conditions exist around detention or retention areas, the bank shall be sloped to proposed dry weather water surface elevation and planted for stabilization purposes. Where slopes are not practical or desired, other methods of bank stabilization will be used and noted on plans submitted. 
                  Dredging, clearing, deepening, widening, straightening, stabilizing or otherwise altering natural waterbodies or canals may be permitted by the town only when a positive benefit can be demonstrated. Such approval by the town does not obviate the need for state or federal agency approvals where applicable. 
                  Sec. 15-710.09. - Direct stormwater discharge. 
                  (a)  Tidal discharges . Where direct discharge are requested into tidal areas, the Department of Natural Resources and/or the Corp of Engineers and the town's engineer approval is required before a permit to construct is granted. Granting of a permit will be based upon unique site hardships and not hardships created by the proposed development plan, or financial consideration. 
                  New drainage outfalls into marshlands, tidal waters, or protected wetlands shall be approved by the Corps of Engineers and/or Georgia Department of Natural Resources. Any modification to existing outfalls that have inverts below +5.3 MSL or any modification that results in the inverts being lower than mean high tide shall be approved by the various state and federal agencies having jurisdiction. 
                  Tide control structures shall be installed where the invert elevation of the first structure is below mean high tide. 
                  (b)  Discharges to natural water bodies. Where specific site require a permit to allow direct discharge into a natural water body, methods of diffusing and filtering the discharge and of reducing velocity may be required. 
                  (c)  Placentia canal . Where specific site require a permit to allow direct discharge into the Placentia Canal, review and approval by the Chatham County Engineer will be required in addition to the director and/or the town's engineer. 
                  (d)  Final landscape design and planting shall not work against the stormwater runoff controls and drainage concepts approved as part of the construction plan approval process. 
                  (e)  Rip rap. Where discharge velocities exceed five feet per second (fps), rip rap shall be provided in accordance with the table herein. Where this is not desirable, energy dissipation devices of concrete may be used instead.

                  Sec. 15-710.10. - Drainage easements. 
                  The town shall require as a condition for obtaining approval of runoff control and drainage plans that the applicant record plats and covenants where available ensuring that drainage easements and facilities are assigned to a specific entity. If the choice of the developer is assignment to town, then issuance of preliminary plat approval may be considered as conditional acceptance of dedication, provided that construction is in accordance with approved plans and conforms to all town and state standards. 
                  Upon receipt of clear, final town approval, the developer shall, within 30 days, submit to town council a request for permanent dedication of drainage improvements for town maintenance. The town's engineer shall certify that all as-built improvements so offered are in conformance with approved plans and with all prevailing town standards. However, authority to accept such improvements for permanent maintenance rest solely with the town council upon recommendation of the town's engineer. 
                  Should drainage facilities and easements be deeded to a homeowners' or landowners' association the general maintenance requirements necessary to insure the long-term functions of stormwater runoff controls, easements and drainage facilities shall be described in the documents establishing the association. The documents will also state that the town or a legal entity having authority over such drainage may perform or require the homeowners' or landowners' association to take action under the following conditions: 
                  1)  If normal maintenance is not performed that is adversely affecting drainage flow. 
                  2)  To alleviate flooding or other emergency drainage problems upstream or downstream of the easement. 
                  Sec. 15-710.11. - Underground storm sewer easements. 
                  Adequate access for maintenance and improvements of the drainage facility will be required. Generally, for underground storm drain pipes the minimum width of the easement shall not be less than 30 feet. Additional width may be required based on drainage requirements. Sufficient width as determined by the town's engineer will be provided within the easement on one side of the pipe to allow for service equipment mobility and storage of removed fill. 
                  Sec. 15-710.12. - Open channel right-of-ways. 
                  Open channel right-of-ways shall be sized in the table below. The open channel shall be located in the easement to provide an adequate maintenance area on each side of the open channel.

                  All storm drainage right-of-ways shall be reviewed by the town's engineer and upon approval recorded in the town courthouse and two copies submitted to the director. 
                  Sec. 15-710.13. - Water surface elevations. 
                  No development will be permitted to construct, establish, maintain or alter the surface water elevation of any waterbody or wetland in such a way as to adversely affect the natural drainage from any upstream or downstream areas of the drainage basin on a permanent basis. 
                  The town's engineer shall review and approve any water surface elevation proposed for lagoons or waterbodies. The developer will submit sufficient groundwater and topographic elevation data around the proposed waterbody site to assist in establishing the water surface elevation and area of coverage. 
                  It may be required as a condition of drainage plan approval that adjustments be made to existing or approved water surface elevations if upstream or downstream areas require such adjustments to provide required drainage flows. 
                  Sec. 15-710.14. - Exemptions from site runoff and drainage planning. 
                  The following activities shall be exempt from the requirements of site runoff control and drainage planning. 
                  a)  Any maintenance, alteration, renewal, use or improvement to an existing drainage structure as approved by the town's engineer which does not create adverse environmental or water quality impacts and does not affect the velocity, volume or location of stormwater runoff discharge; and 
                  b)  Work by agencies or property owners required to meet emergency flooding conditions. If possible, emergency work should be approved by the duly appointed officials in charge of emergency preparedness or emergency relief. Property owners performing emergency work will be responsible for any damage caused by their unauthorized actions. Property owners will restore the site of the emergency work to it approximate pre-emergency conditions within a period of 60 days following the end of the emergency. 
                  Sec. 15-710.15. - Erosion and sediment control. 
                  Erosion and sedimentation controls shall be required on all sites adjacent to waterbodies or drainage ways in which one-half contiguous acre or more of land surface is to be uncovered. The applicant shall show erosion and sediment control measures between the uncovered areas and adjacent waterbodies or drainage ways on plans submitted for approval. (See The State of Georgia "Manual for Erosion and Sedimentation Control" for details). The owner must apply for a land disturbing activity permit in accordance with the requirements of the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975 and the Rules of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources as amended. 
                  Sec. 15-710.16. - Lakes, ponds and waterways. 
                  Artificial or natural waterways, lakes, or ponds for recreation shall not be accepted for maintenance by the town. 
                  Waterways, lakes, ponds, detention or retention basins shall be maintained by either an established homeowners association or individual property owner(s). In either case, the subdivision plat must indicate who will be responsible for maintenance. Town will not accept maintenance of drainage basins. 
                  Private maintenance provisions must be made to the satisfaction of the town's engineer. The developer is not allowed to be designated as the responsible provider of maintenance. Placing responsibility on the owner(s) of the property where the feature is located is allowed if suitable notes and easements are provided on the subdivision plat and other legal instruments.

                  River Drive Mixed Use District 
                  I. Intent. 
                  River Drive is the main point of entry into Thunderbolt and serves as the front door and "main street" of Thunderbolt through the civic presence of town hall and Waterfront Park, commercial presence of restaurants and businesses, as well as the front door to the Wilmington River/Intracoastal Waterway. As such, the development along River Drive should reflect the town's unique character, including its cultural and architectural heritage. 
                  ( Ord. of 5-10-2017 , § I, 5-10-2017) 
                  II. Guiding Principles. 
                  The following principles shall guide development and redevelopment along River Drive: 
                  1.  Public Waterfront—The waterfront and marshes are inherently tied to the culture, heritage, and economic prosperity of Thunderbolt. Despite previous decisions, visual connections and, where feasible, physical connections to the river and marsh are of the utmost importance. 
                  2.  Town—Thunderbolt is a town—larger than a village, but smaller than a city. The scale and design of the buildings, the landscape, and hardscape shall reflect the intimate ambiance and character of Thunderbolt. 
                  3.  Tree Canopy—One of the most iconic images of Thunderbolt is the "tree island" in River Drive with majestic live oaks forming a canopy over River Drive. Fortunately, many other live oaks exist along River Drive as well. Whenever possible, healthy existing live oaks should be preserved and new ones planted to sustain the canopy over time. 
                  4.  A Place for All—As the "Main Street," River Drive should comfortably accommodate people of all ages, abilities, and mobility choices. The public realm and the adjacent development, shall provide a comfortable and inviting walking environment through appropriate design, scale, infrastructure, and landscape. 
                  ( Ord. of 5-10-2017 , § II, 5-10-2017) 
                  III. General Provisions. 
                  1.  Pedestrian comfort shall be a primary consideration along River Drive. Design conflicts between vehicular and pedestrian movement generally shall be decided in favor of the pedestrian. 
                  2.  Each lot with frontage along River Drive shall front River Drive. Façades shall be built parallel to the principal frontage, with the primary building entrance facing River Drive. 
                  3.  Dumpsters, outside storage, mechanical equipment, etc. shall not be visible from the public right-of-way and shall be screened by a landscape wall high enough to visually conceal equipment, storage, and/or service areas located behind. The minimum height of the wall shall be the actual height required to screen the object from view. 
                  4.  Drive-throughs are prohibited. 
                  ( Ord. of 5-10-2017 , § III, 5-10-2017)

                  X. Building Standards. 
                  These building guidelines are intended to encourage quality, attention to detail, and an appreciation of the coastal vernacular appropriate for River Drive. Buildings along River Drive should be timeless and reflective of coastal architectural styles appropriate for the area. 
                  1.  Materials. Materials establish architectural character and can lend variety to the appearance of a district. Material should be based on those that have historically appeared in construction in the coastal region. Vinyl siding is prohibited. 
                  2.  Style. Architectural style should be consistent with the coastal vernacular of Thunderbolt and coastal Georgia. The consistency of a single style used on a building is essential. 
                  i.  Architectural stylistic integrity is encouraged. 
                  ii.  All elements of design, shape, and form should be consistent with the selected architectural style. 
                  iii.  Ornamentation should be restrained, simplistic in style, and appropriate to the style of the building. 
                  iv.  Buildings with frontage along Bannon Drive shall be residential in character in order to be compatible with the adjacent residential dwellings along Bannon Drive. 
                  3.  Roof. 
                  i.  Roof material shall be galvanized roofing (standing seam or v-crimp), wood, composite/manufactured shake, architectural shingles. 
                  ii.  Principal roof(s) shall be a symmetrical with a slope of 4:12 to 12:12. Flat roofs may be permitted based on architectural merit of the building and if approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission. 
                  iii.  Eave Treatments: 
                  1.  Prefer open rafters without full fascia and no horizontal soffits. 
                  2.  Where provided, wood and fiber composite fascia and soffits are encouraged - vinyl is prohibited. 
                  4.  Entryways. Entryways comprise doorways, porches and other elements that contribute to the sense of arrival into the building. Entryways should be a prominent feature of the façade. 
                  5.  Windows and Doors. 
                  i.  Windows and doors shall generally be complimentary to the architectural style of the building. 
                  ii.  Window openings shall have vertical proportions, or may be square. 
                  iii.  Consider using muntins in windows to create divided lites. 
                  iv.  Wood and composite doors solid cores are encouraged—Steel is discouraged. 
                  6.  Shutters. Window shutters are part of the coastal vernacular and were functional for providing interior shading in the summer and to protect windows during storms. With the advent of air conditioning, window shutters became less functional and practical, serving instead as an ornamental design element. The following should be addressed when designing shutters for a building: 
                  i.  Shutters shall be of louvered or paneled wood construction. 
                  ii.  Shutters shall be one-half the width of the sash they are covering. All shutters are encouraged to be installed to be operable, with hinges and dogs (a device mounted to the wall that may be pivoted to prevent the shutter from moving when in the open position). 
                  7.  Porches. 
                  i.  The use of porches is highly encouraged. 
                  ii.  Front porches should be designed to have a depth that is great enough to make them functional spaces. Generally, front porches should be a minimum of 25% of the total façade in width and at least ten (10) feet in depth to allow adequate room for furnishings and circulation. 
                  iii.  Front porches shall not be enclosed with wood, glass, screens, or other materials. 
                  iv.  Side porches may be screened if the structural framework for the screen panels is minimal and the open appearance of the porch is maintained. Screen panels should be placed behind the original features such as columns or railings. 
                  8.  Fences. Fences are often character defining features and should be treated sensitively. It is important that the fence design harmonize with the character of the structure. 
                  i.  Fences, garden walls, and gates should be appropriate in materials, design, and scale to the character of the structure they surround. 
                  ii.  Woven wire (chain link), stockade fences (with jagged tops), and vinyl fences are prohibited. 
                  iii.  Gates should be compatible with any existing fencing, walls or landscaping, and should be designed to swing onto the private walkway, not onto the public sidewalk or right-of-way. 
                  iv.  Front yard fences shall be no more than 48" in height. 
                  9.  Garages and Garage Doors. 
                  i.  For residential structures, the garage should serve as a secondary use and be subservient in scale and mass to the house. 
                  ii.  Garages are encouraged to be detached and located at the rear of the property. 
                  iii.  Attached garages shall be side loading to avoid facing the street. 
                  iv.  Garage bays should be individual bays with doors no wider than ten (10) feet. Double wide doors are not allowed. 
                  ( Ord. of 5-10-2017 , § X, 5-10-2017) 
                  XI. Signs. 
                  Materials, colors, size, and shapes of proposed signs shall be compatible with the related buildings. Size and proportion of the sign shall not be a dominant feature of the site and shall be judged by sizes and proportions of signs on adjacent and nearby properties which are compatible with the character of river drive. In addition to the standards of article XIII of the zoning ordinance, the following shall apply: 
                  1.  Free-standing signs shall be no more than 8' in height and 6' in width. The sign area shall be no more than 25 square feet for a single tenant and 30 feet for multiple tenants. Pylon signs are not allowed. 
                  2.  Projecting signs are allowed and shall be no more than six (6) square feet in area and shall be installed with a minimum clear height of 8' below the sign.

                  XII. Existing uses. 
                  At the time a new use or structure is placed on any property within the River Drive District the property owner shall bring the site and building into compliance with the standards set forth for the River Drive District. At the time a property owner plans to alter the façade of a structure (other than normal maintenance or upkeep) the property owner must comply with the building and architectural standards. It is the intent of this provision that new structures, as well as existing structures when altered in appearance or size, comply with all the standards contained herein and in particular the building and architectural standards contained herein. It is the intent of this section to require all properties and structures within the River Drive District to comply with the River Drive District standards over time so that the district will at some point have a design and appearance consistent with the intent of the general principles set forth in this ordinance.

                  Victory Drive Mixed Use District 
                  I. Intent. 
                  The Mayor and Council of the Town of Thunderbolt hereby establish an overlay district on Victory Drive called the Victory Drive District to recognize the "Main Street" prominence of Victory Drive and manage and encourage specific types of development. The overlay district will be administered as a part of the existing development review process and will encourage small scale, mixed-use residential and commercial businesses. 
                  ( Ord. of 5-9-2018, § I (Exh. A) ) 
                  II. Guiding Principles. 
                  The following principles shall guide development and redevelopment along the Victory Drive District: 
                  •  Overlay District—At the time a new use or structure is placed on any property within the Victory Drive District, the property owner shall bring the site and building into compliance with the standards set forth for the Victory Drive District. At the time a property owner plans to alter the exterior of a structure the property owner must comply with the Building and Architectural standards. All work must be approved by the Town's Planning and Zoning Commission. It is the intent of this provision that new structures, as well as existing structures when altered in appearance or size, comply with all the standards contained herein and in particular the building and architectural standards contained herein. It is the intent of this section to require all properties and structures within the Victory Drive District to comply with the Victory Drive District standards over time so that the district will at some point have a design and appearance consistent with the intent of the general principles set forth in this ordinance. 
                  •  The Town of Thunderbolt is a town—larger than a village, but smaller than a city. The scale and design of the buildings, the landscape, and hardscape shall reflect the intimate ambiance and character of Thunderbolt. 
                  •  Tree Canopy—One of the most iconic images of Victory Drive is the historic palm median and majestic live oaks. It is the intention of this ordinance that new development or changes in use explore the potential to return the live oak framework to the commercialized district streetscape. Healthy existing live oaks shall be preserved and new ones planted to sustain the canopy. Refer to Town of Thunderbolt's tree ordinance. 
                  •  One goal of this ordinance is to provide sidewalks on the south side of Victory Drive between the commercial district and the Wilmington River Bridge. Sidewalks on the north side of Victory Drive are also encouraged. 
                  •  A Place for All—Victory Drive should comfortably accommodate people of all ages, abilities, and mobility choices. The public realm and the adjacent development shall provide a comfortable and inviting environment through appropriate design, scale, infrastructure, and landscape. 
                  ( Ord. of 5-9-2018, § II (Exh. A) ) 
                  III. General Provisions. 
                  1.  Each lot with frontage along Victory Drive shall front Victory Drive. Facades shall be built parallel to the principal frontage, with the primary building entrance facing Victory Drive. On a corner lot, the developer or owner is encouraged to place the primary entrance to be on a secondary road. 
                  2.  Dumpsters, outside storage, mechanical equipment, etc., shall not be visible from the public right-of-way and shall be screened by landscaping or a wall high enough to visually conceal equipment, storage, and/or service areas located behind. The minimum height of the landscaping or wall shall be the actual height required to screen the object from view. 
                  3.  Drive-throughs will only be allowed after it is shown that the use of a drive through will not interfere with traffic on the public street. 
                  4.  It is the intent of this ordinance to maintain and/or reestablish local street networks and provide for local road networks adjacent to Victory Drive that accommodate cars, pedestrians and bicycles and then connect to an existing street network so that there are future connections to adjacent parcels. One goal is to create Interparcel connections and shared access in order to improve safety and minimize both impacts on historic landscape and the need for turn lanes on Victory Drive.

                  VIII. Landscape and Streetscape. 
                  The Landscape 
                  The landscape, the site's existing and new vegetation, plays an essential role in creating the Town's Character. Its design and maintenance must therefore be given prominent attention starting at the conceptual phase of a project. Historically, Live Oaks, palms, and azaleas have been predominate in the existing Town landscape. Great care should be taken to incorporate this aesthetic into the design, preserve a variety of existing native trees and shrubs, and minimize environmental impacts from development. 
                  Topography 
                  While the Town generally has little variation in topography it is important to identify the existing conditions in terms of drainage and flood elevation requirements. In consideration of the latter, alternative methods such as dry flood proofing and terracing should be utilized in lieu of fill to reduce the impact of elevation changes. No fill is allowed in any flood zone unless it is in accordance with Federal, State and the Town's ordinances. 
                  Existing Vegetation and Significant Trees 
                  Two of the most important site features that need to be identified are existing vegetation including understory and significant trees. These are extremely important elements to be addressed in the placement of structures and other site features as trees contribute to the overall quality of life and identity of Thunderbolt. In some cases, the location of the tree canopy or a specimen tree will be the dominant determining factor in the site design as well as the architectural design of the structures. Existing vegetation that can be preserved, especially in buffers, adds significantly to the project's Town Character. 
                  Setbacks and Buffers 
                  Adjacent use and street setback lines and buffers must be identified in order to establish the extent of site features such as parking spaces and stormwater retention areas. These are not "build to" lines but simply define the area in which structures and other development are allowed and separate development from adjacent streets and adjacent development. Separation serves to ensure protection from street traffic as well as provide adequate air circulation and light between structures. Projects that fill the buildable area with structures and paving will have a difficult time achieving Town Character and ultimate approval. 
                  Buffers 
                  The most important component of buffers is the vegetation they contain. Buffers can be classified into three basic categories: 
                  UNDISTURBED BUFFERS: A buffer where all of the existing vegetation is neither removed nor pruned. 
                  NATURAL BUFFERS: A buffer where some existing vegetation is removed or pruned. Some additional plant materials may be added to natural buffers to enhance their appearance. Any additional plantings should be native species complimentary to the existing vegetation. Their placement should be designed so that they appear as if they were a part of the existing vegetation. 
                  LANDSCAPED BUFFERS: A buffer where most of the vegetation has been planted. Planting may be more formal and may be shaped by more extensive pruning. 
                  Shrubs 
                  Shrubs must be selected to complement the natural setting, provide visual interest, and screen less desirable elements of the project. The species used must take into consideration the site's growing conditions and existing vegetation types. While a variety of species is desirable for texture and color, emphasis must be given to overall order and continuity of the landscape plan. Seasonal availability and planting time also need to be considered. 
                  Groundcovers 
                  Groundcover plants should generally be a limited part of the landscape plan. When used, evergreen species with low maintenance needs are to be selected. Large grassed lawn areas encompassing a major portion of the site are to be avoided. Grass is appropriate as borders or around entrances and other focal points; grass shall not be allowed to be planted within a mower's width away from the base of existing trees. Pine straw or other mulch indigenous to the area should be used to stabilize areas and control weed growth. 
                  Trees 
                  Tree removal and replacement requirements are established by the Town's Tree Ordinance. While these minimum requirements must be adhered to, there are additional aesthetic considerations that must also be implemented when a tree removal or landscape plan is submitted. These include: 
                  •  Preserving the tree canopy; 
                  •  Protecting significant or specimen trees and clusters of trees; 
                  •  Preserving smaller understory trees and shrubs; 
                  •  Requiring larger size replacement trees or additional trees depending on the size or number of existing trees removed or relationship to building mass and height; and 
                  •  Selection of particular species of replacement trees within a required category for screening or visual effect. 
                  The top priority for the location of existing trees and new trees are street buffers, parking lots, and the area between parking lots and structures. This is a major component of Town Character. 
                  ( Ord. of 5-9-2018, § VIII (Exh. A) ) 
                  IX. Building and Architectural Standards. 
                  These building guidelines are intended to encourage quality, attention to detail, and an appreciation of the coastal vernacular appropriate for Victory Drive. Buildings along Victory Drive should be timeless and reflective of coastal architectural styles appropriate for the area. 
                  a.  Materials 
                  Materials establish architectural character and can lend variety to the appearance of a district. Material should be based on those that have historically appeared in construction in the coastal region. Vinyl siding is prohibited. Corrugated metal may be used and visible on the exterior of the building in limited ways as approved by the Town if its use is consistent with coastal architecture for the low country and a fishing village style. Metal buildings are only allowed if the outside portions of the building are covered by some other acceptable finish that is consistent with coastal and low country architecture and a fishing village style. 
                  The overall exterior color scheme must be selected to be harmonious and blend with the natural surroundings of the site. Earth tones must be chosen as the predominant colors. Colors shall not be used to cause the structure to stand out. Consideration must be given to the compatibility of colors with those existing in the vicinity. The size of the structure and the amount of shading it will receive are also factors in the selection of colors. 
                  Any accent colors shall be of analogous tints, shades or tones that are low in intensity or brightness. Primary, secondary and highly saturated, bright colors should be avoided. Accent colors may only be approved for very limited use where appropriate to highlight a feature of the design. A small area of brighter color may be appropriate to emphasize an architectural detail but will not be approved for a larger area. The number of such colors shall be limited and must be compatible within the overall color scheme. 
                  Exterior color schemes must avoid placing together colors with values that are highly contrasting. Subtle levels of contrast are desirable to emphasize architectural elements. A slightly darker wall color on the bottom story of a two-story structure may help reduce the visual height of the building. As an example, the use of black and white or off-white together is typically avoided and may be approved only for very limited use where a high level of contrast is warranted. 
                  b.  Style 
                  Architectural style should be consistent with the coastal vernacular of Thunderbolt and coastal Georgia. The consistency of a single style used on a building is essential. 
                  i.  Architectural stylistic integrity is required. 
                  ii.  All elements of design, shape, and form shall be consistent with the selected architectural style. 
                  iii.  Ornamentation shall be restrained, simplistic in style, and appropriate to the style of the building. 
                  c.  Roof 
                  i.  Roof material shall be galvanized roofing (standing seam or v-crimp), wood, composite/manufactured shake and/or architectural shingles. Principal roof(s) shall be a symmetrical with a slope of 4:12 to 12:12. Flat roofs will only be permitted based on architectural merit of the building. 
                  ii.  Eave Treatments: 
                  1.  Open rafters without full fascia and without horizontal soffits are preferred. 
                  2.  Where provided, wood and fiber composite fascia and soffits are encouraged—vinyl and aluminum are prohibited. 
                  d.  Entryways 
                  Entryways comprise doorways, porches and other elements that contribute to the sense of arrival into the building. Entryways shall be a prominent feature of the facade. 
                  e.  Windows and Doors 
                  i.  Windows and doors shall generally be complimentary to the architectural style of the building. 
                  ii.  Window openings shall have vertical proportions, or may be square. 
                  iii.  Muntins in windows to create divided lites are encouraged. 
                  iv.  Wood and composite solid cores doors are encouraged—Steel is discouraged. 
                  f.  Shutters 
                  Window shutters are part of the coastal vernacular and were functional for providing interior shading in the summer and to protect windows during storms. With the advent of air conditioning, window shutters became less functional and practical, serving instead as an ornamental design element. The following shall be addressed when designing shutters for a building: 
                  i.  Shutters shall be of louvered or paneled wood construction. 
                  ii.  Shutters shall be one-half the width of the sash they are covering. All shutters are encouraged to be installed to be operable, with hinges and dogs provided. 
                  g.  Porches 
                  i.  The use of porches is highly encouraged. 
                  ii.  Front porches should be designed to have a depth that is great enough to make them functional spaces. Generally, front porches should be a minimum of 25% of the total facade in width and at least ten (10) feet in depth to allow adequate room for furnishings and circulation. 
                  iii.  Front porches shall not be enclosed with wood, glass, screens, or other materials. 
                  iv.  Side porches may be screened if the structural framework for the screen panels is minimal and the open appearance of the porch is maintained. Screen panels should be placed behind the original features such as columns or railings. 
                  h.  Fences 
                  Fences are often character-defining features and should be treated sensitively. It is important that the fence design harmonize with the character of the structure. 
                  i.  Fences, garden walls, and gates should be appropriate in materials, design, and scale to the character of the structure they surround. 
                  ii.  Woven wire (chain link), stockade fences (with jagged tops), dog ear and vinyl fences are prohibited. 
                  iii.  Gates shall be compatible with any fencing, walls or landscaping, and should be designed to swing onto the private walkway, not onto the public sidewalk or right-of-way. Life-safety and egress shall be considered when locating all gates and gate swings. 
                  iv.  Front yard fences shall be no more than 48" in height. 
                  i.  Garages and Garage Doors 
                  i.  For residential structures, the garage should serve as a secondary use and be subservient in scale and mass to the house. 
                  ii.  Garages are encouraged to be detached and located at the rear of the property. 
                  iii.  Attached garages shall be side-loading to avoid facing the street. 
                  iv.  Garage bays should be individual bays with doors no wider than ten (10) feet. Double wide doors are not allowed. 
                  ( Ord. of 5-9-2018, § IX (Exh. A) ) 
                  X. Signs. 
                  Materials, colors, size, and shapes of proposed signs shall be compatible with the related buildings. Size and proportion of the sign shall not be a dominant feature of the site and shall be proportion and compatible with the character of the Victory Drive Standards. In addition to the standards of Article XIII of the zoning ordinance, the following shall apply: 
                  a.  Free-standing signs shall be no more than 8' in height and 6' in width. The sign area shall be no more than 25 square feet for a single tenant and 30 square feet for multiple tenants. Pylon signs are not allowed. 
                  b.  Projecting signs are allowed and shall be no more than six (6) square feet in area and shall be installed with a minimum clear height of 8' below the lowest portion of the sign. 
                  In addition the guidelines herein below shall be considered and adhered to regarding the use of signs: 
                  i.  Signs are an important element to most buildings and developments. Too often no allowance is made in the design of projects for the placement of signs. Many of the principles for good design of structures also apply to the design of signs. Sign design does not begin with a blank sheet of paper. The materials, details, and colors of the building are all starting points for good sign design. In other words, signs should reflect the design of the project they are intended to identify. 
                  ii.  The size and number of signs will be determined by the Town's Sign Ordinance. Signs should serve to identify the business or development and not act as advertisements. The amount of information on signs shall be no more than is necessary to provide reasonable identification of the business. 
                  iii.  Signs should provide strong visual interest and include three-dimensional design. Only high quality, durable materials such as wood, sign foam, and masonry shall be used. Bright colors and reflective surfaces shall be avoided or very limited in size and used as accents rather than predominant design elements. 
                  iv.  For facade signs, adequate wall space must be provided in a location that will allow the sign to function properly while also appear as if it "belongs" with the building. The sign should be placed within a single architectural element and the colors, materials, and details should compliment the structure's design. In good sign design the facade signs appear as an integral component of the building design rather than as an afterthought. Tenant signs at shopping centers and office complexes should be uniform in design and placed on the facade of the tenant space. 
                  v.  Freestanding or monument signs should be placed in logical locations near the project's entrance and their design must complement the architectural design of the building(s) and other elements of development on the site. Monument signs with one sign face shall be finished on the "back" side. 
                  vi.  Good sign design should apply to all signs on a site including monument signs, directional signs, and facade signs. A successful sign system will integrate all sign types on site in a unified system of materials, colors, shapes, and sizes that are compatible with the architecture and other site elements. Tenants may be required to select colors and fonts for their signs that are different than their typical logo colors and fonts in order to comply with the approved sign system. 
                  ( Ord. of 5-9-2018, § X (Exh. A) ) 
                  XI. Lighting. 
                  Decorative type lighting is allowed if limited in scope and properly designed. The goal is to add to the visual quality of the development without detracting from the beauty of the night sky. Such lighting may include concealed low wattage landscape up lights for significant trees or shrubbery at an entryway. Low bollard type lighting can be used to illuminate walkways and drive aisles. Important architectural elements can be softly illuminated to add emphasis at night. When lighting trees up lighting is preferred. Any light fixtures mounted in a tree must follow best management practices to avoid damage to the tree. 
                  LED lights are preferred over Incandescent lamps, metal halide, halogen or any other high wattage type lights. The same type of light source must be used for the same or similar types of lighting on site. The style and finish of exterior lighting, including fixtures and poles, should be selected to complement the details and materials of the structure and other site elements. A consistent finish should be selected for fixtures of similar types throughout the site. 
                  ( Ord. of 5-9-2018, § XI (Exh. A) ) 
                  XII. Procedures/Design Review/Submittal Requirements. 
                  All plans and petitions for new buildings and/or exterior changes to existing buildings and/or any site within the Victory Drive District will need to be submitted via application to the Town's Zoning Administrator for presentation to the zoning commission (and possibly Town Council) for approval. 
                  In addition to all other submittal requirements in Article XV or elsewhere within the Town's ordinances, the following specific submittal requirements must be adhered to for any exterior modifications and/or new development within the Victory Drive District. Any application submitted without the required submittals will be considered incomplete and not ready for review by the Town's staff and/or the Planning and Zoning Commission. 
                  1.  Preliminary Design Submission 
                  A preliminary application is mandatory for all New Construction or major renovations. Preliminary review determines whether the style and design of a project is compatible with the established architectural designs and concepts for Victory Drive. A preliminary application consists of a completed "Application," including samples of building materials and colors to be used, review fee, two sets of design documents and one set of digital PDF design documents that must include: 
                  a.  Site Development Plan—provide a current (less than five years old) tree survey that identifies clearly the species, condition (healthy, diseased, or dead), location and circumference of all trees 12" or larger in girth as measured 36" above ground level. Indicate all trees and significant other vegetation to be removed by a bold "X" and the reason removal is requested. Every effort should be made to save significant, desirable trees where new construction, additions, or construction of pools, decks, patios, etc., is involved.

                  ARTICLE VI. - DISTRICTS SHOWN ON MAPS 
                  The boundaries of the various districts are shown on a zoning map of Thunderbolt, Georgia, which is located in the office of the town hall. The zoning map of the incorporated area is hereby made a part of this ordinance; and all notations, references, and other information shown thereon shall be as much a part of this ordinance as if all the matter and information set forth by said maps were fully described herein. 
                  ARTICLE VII. - INTERPRETATION OF ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES 
                  When uncertainty exists with respect to the location of boundaries of any zoning district as shown on the zoning map of the Town of Thunderbolt the following rules shall apply: 
                  1.  Unless otherwise specifically indicated, where district boundaries are indicated on the zoning map as approximately following the centerline of a street, highway, railroad right-of-way, stream bed or river bed or such centerlines extended, then such centerlines shall be construed to be such district boundaries. 
                  2.  Where district boundaries are indicated on the zoning map as approximately following the corporate limits line of the town, then such corporate limits line shall be construed to be such district boundaries. 
                  3.  Where district boundaries are indicated on the zoning map as being set back from a street, road, highway, railroad, stream or river and parallel thereto, then such district boundaries, unless otherwise specifically indicated, shall be construed as being at the scaled distance from the centerline of such street, road, highway, railroad, stream or river as being parallel thereto. 
                  4.  Where a district boundary divides a lot, the requirements for the district in which the greater portion of the lot lies shall be extended to the balance of the lot; provided, however, that such extension shall not include any part of such lot which lies more than 50 feet beyond the district boundary; and provided further, that this provision shall not apply to a through lot. In the case of a through lot, the restrictions of the district applying to adjoining lots which front on the same street as the lot frontage in question shall apply. 
                  5.  The board of zoning appeals shall determine questions regarding the exact location of district boundary lines. 
                  ARTICLE VIII. - PROVISIONS REGARDING USES 
                  Permitted uses in the various zoning districts are identified in this ordinance. Uses permitted upon review require site plan approval by the board of zoning appeals. Such designation requires a finding by the board of zoning appeals of the following conditions of fact prior to issuing a conditional approval: 
                  1.  The development of such use at the location proposed, and in the manner proposed, will not adversely affect abutting residential property. 
                  2.  The site development plan of such use provides for adequate vehicular and pedestrian access and circulation, and that the resulting concentration of vehicular traffic will not present traffic problems or impede normal movement on adjacent streets. 
                  3.  The need for such a use is justified on the basis of facts presented by the applicant which clearly indicates that such use would be appropriate, add to the orderly development of the community, and would further the purpose and intent of this ordinance. 
                  ARTICLE IX. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT 
                  Planned Requirement 
                  1.  Purpose . Planned development districts may be required by the mayor and alderman for properties which, in their judgment, deserve or require special considerations for site plan development due to proximity of residential uses, the intensity of proposed development, or the presence of actual or potential traffic problems, including access and egress. The prefix "P" may be applied to any zoning district classification for any property that meets the aforementioned criteria. 
                  2.  Planned requirement. A "P" district classification may be initiated by a petitioner or by the mayor and aldermen. Prior to adoption of a plan development classification for a property a sight development plan shall be presented to the planning and zoning commission for approval. As a part of its consideration of a sight plan in a plan district the planning and zoning commissioner shall recommend a maximum density for residential uses within the proposed "P" district. Such recommendation shall be considered by the mayor and aldermen at the time of the public hearing on any re-zoning proposed. The mayor and aldermen may elect to approve the recommended density requirement, modify it or reject it. If the maximum density standard is approved, it shall become a part of the zoning classification of the property and be so stated on the official zoning map. (For example an R-3 may become a P-R-3-15 meaning a maximum of 15 units per net acre). 
                  3.  Land development standards. The planning and zoning commission may require developers or contractors to provide a general development plan for consideration at the time of application for rezoning. 
                  4.  General plan. The general plan for a proposed P-district shall include proposed uses and overall development standards and shall indicate the proposed use or reuse of all land, open spaces, location of major streets, recreation areas, school sites, religious centers, and such other plan elements and reasonable design criteria as may be deemed necessary by the planning and zoning commission in a pre-application conference to accomplish the purposes of the zoning ordinance. 
                  5.  Intent . Such plan shall promote a stable environment, and desirable character in harmony with the established or proposed land use pattern in surrounding areas. 
                  6.  Specific plan. Following approval of the generalized development plan by the planning and zoning commission, no development shall take place until detailed development plans or subdivision plats, where required, be submitted for review and are approved. Specific site plans shall be considered after approval of a general development plan by the planning and zoning commission and the mayor and aldermen of the Town of Thunderbolt. In smaller projects, a general development plan may be required, but the planning and zoning commission should be consulted as to the requirement for a general development plan. 
                  If property within a P- (Planned) zone is to be developed in phases, such detailed development plans may be submitted in phases. 
                  Specific development plans shall indicate in detail the layout of proposed streets and curb cuts; parking areas; amenities such as open spaces, landscapes, pedestrian and bicycle trails; major drainage ways; school locations; church locations; locations of public facilities; building arrangements; commercial areas; lot arrangements and other significant details as may be reasonably required. 
                  Specific development plans approved by the zoning commission shall be certified to the zoning administrator for the issuance of applicable permits. Development requiring subdivision actions shall be processed in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Thunderbolt Subdivision Regulations. No development shall take place within a P-District that is not shown on a specific development plan as certified by the planning and zoning commission. 
                  7.  Standards . Development standards shall be applied as provided elsewhere in this chapter for the particular district. Provided that the board of zoning appeals may approve variances from these requirements at the request of the developer on a finding that such variances would: 
                  1.  Be in keeping with the overall character of the area. 
                  2.  Would not be contrary to the purpose and intent of this ordinance. 
                  3.  Would not be detrimental to existing or proposed surrounding uses. 
                  4.  Would serve public purposes to a degree equal to or greater than the standards replaced. 
                  8.  Overlay district. When an area is rezoned to a planned district classification, the letter "P" shall be placed in front of the standard zoning classification identification for the area in question, e.g., an area zoned R-3, which is rezoned to a planned district classification, shall be indicated as a P-R-3. 
                  ARTICLE X. - OFF-STREET PARKING AND SERVICE REQUIREMENTS 
                  1.  Generally . 
                  (a)  Duty to provide off-street parking and loading. Except as hereinafter provided, no land shall be used or occupied, and no use shall be designed, created, altered, used or occupied, and no use shall be operated unless off-street parking and loading facilities are provided in at least the amount required by this article; provided, however, that any use in operation on the effective date of this ordinance that does not have the required off-street parking and loading spaces shall not be required to provide off-street parking and loading spaces until such time as the existing gross floor area is increased by 40 percent or more. 
                  (b)  Off-street loading and parking to meet design standards . Whenever off-street parking and/or loading facilities are established within any zoning district either as a principal use or an accessory use, and whether or not required by this ordinance, such off-street parking and loading facilities shall comply with design requirements for off-street parking facilities set forth in this article. 
                  Required minimum off street loading space shall be provided. There shall be sufficient space to accommodate the maximum number of trucks that will be loading, unloading or stored at any one time; provided, however that there shall be a minimum of one off street loading space for each 10,000 square feet of total floor area or fraction thereof. Each loading space shall be not less than ten feet wide and shall be of such length as is necessary to accommodate the type of cab or truck or bus that will be loading, unloading or parking; provided, however, that such length shall be not less than 30 feet. Such spaces, including maneuvering space shall be located entirely off the street. All required off street loading spaces shall be located on the same lot as the building or use, which they are intended to serve. 
                  (c)  Permit required. No land shall be developed as a parking lot and no structure shall be developed as a parking garage without a permit from the zoning administrator. 
                  2.  Plan and design standards. 
                  (a)  Parking and loading areas—Surface materials. Off-street parking and loading areas containing more than 1,000 square feet of parking and driveway space shall be paved with concrete or asphalt pavement and subject to green space provisions. 
                  (b)  Separation from walkways and streets. All off-street parking, off-street loading, and service areas shall be separated from walkways, sidewalks, streets, and lanes by curbing or other protective devices. 
                  (c)  Buffer required when adjoining property is residential. Where off-street parking, loading or service areas are proposed to be located closer than 50 feet to a lot in any R zoning district or to any lot upon which there exists a dwelling as a permitted use, and where such parking, loading or service areas are not entirely screened visually from such lot by an intervening building or structure, there shall be provided along the lot line a continuous visual buffer with a minimum height of six feet. No such buffer shall extend nearer to a street right-of-way line than the established building line of the adjoining residential lot, and no buffer shall be required along a property line immediately adjoining and parallel to a lane. The buffer shall be of a width determined by the board of zoning appeals, and shall contain within such width a compact evergreen hedge or other type of foliage screening, or a combined fence and shrubbery screen, the latter facing the adjoining residential lot. 
                  (d)  Size of driveways. A driveway exclusive of curb return radii shall be not less than 12 feet in width. A curb return radius for a driveway at its entrance to a public street shall not exceed ten feet. The maximum width of a driveway exclusive of curb return radii shall not exceed 35 feet. 
                  (e)  Location of curb cuts. At the Intersection of streets, except lanes and alleys, a curb cut shall be set back not less than 25 feet from the intersection of two curb lines or such lines extended, or shall be set back not less than 15 feet from the intersection of two property lines or such lines extended, whichever is the less restrictive. Between the curb returns for any two driveways serving the same property, there shall be at least 20 feet of curb; except that this distance may be reduced to as little as five feet where it is demonstrated that restricted frontage makes this necessary in order to provide not more than two adequate driveways for the property. 
                  (f)  Required off-street parking area shall not be reduced. No off-street parking area shall be reduced in size or encroached upon by buildings, vehicle storage, loading or unloading, or any other use where such reduction or encroachment will reduce the off-street parking and loading spaces below that required by this article. 
                  (g)  Joint parking facilities . The off-street parking requirements for two or more neighboring uses, of the same or different types, may be satisfied by the allocation of the required number of spaces for each use in a common parking facility; provided, that the number of off-street parking spaces is not less than the sum of individual requirements; and provided further, that there be compliance with all other provisions of this chapter. 
                  (h)  Parking provided on same lot as main building. Off-street parking spaces for one-family and two-family dwellings shall be located on the same lots as the main building to be served. Off-street parking spaces for multi-family dwellings shall be located on the same lot as the main building to be served or not more than 300 feet distance, as measured along the nearest pedestrian walkway. Off-street parking spaces for all other uses shall be provided on the same lot as the main building to be served or not more than 600 feet distance, as measured along the nearest pedestrian walkway. 
                  (i)  Sharing of parking facilities . Off-street parking facilities for one use shall not be considered as providing the required facilities for any other use; provided, that one-half of the off-street parking space required by any use whose peak attendance will be at night or on Sundays, such as churches, theaters, and assembly halls, may be assigned to a use which will be closed at night or on Sundays. 
                  (j)  Fractional spaces. When units of measurements determining the number of required off-street parking and off-street loading spaces result in the requirement of a fractional space, any fraction up to and including one-half shall be disregarded and fractions over one-half shall, require one off-street parking or off-street loading space. 
                  (k)  Other use of off-street parking space prohibited. No off-street parking or loading area shall be used for the display, sale, repair, dismantling, or servicing of any vehicle, equipment, materials, or supplies. 
                  (l)  Green space. In all zoning districts, 65 percent of the designated setback area of a lot shall consist of permanent permeable surface so as to permit the absorption of water and shall not be paved, built upon, or covered with a manmade material in such a way so as to interfere with the permeability of the surface. 
                  3.  Remote parking facility. Where the off-street parking facility for a proposed building or use cannot be provided on the site occupied by such building or use, and is therefore provided in accordance with the provisions of this article, the applicant shall submit his application for a building permit, an instrument duly executed and acknowledged, which accepts as a condition for the issuance of a building permit or occupancy permit the continued availability of such off-street parking facilities. 
                  4.  Minimum space requirements for off-street parking areas. All uses of land and structures within all zoning districts of the town shall be required to provide off-street parking spaces in the numbers hereinafter specified. 
                  5.  Non-residential parking. Parking provisions shall apply to all non-residential structures and related remote parking lots, if not otherwise set forth in the parking regulations table in the existing Zoning Ordinance, the facility shall have employee parking of at least one parking space for each two employees. 
                  Parking Requirements 

                   
                  6.  Minimum space requirements for uses not specifically covered by article X. Each public or private building or land use not covered by these requirements shall provide such parking space for residents, visitors, or patrons, as the board of zoning appeals shall deem necessary. In making such a determination, the board of zoning appeals shall be guided by the number of persons to be employed in such building or by such use; the number of persons expected to reside in, visit, or patronize such building or use; the anticipated percentage of residents, visitors, or patrons driving automobiles; and the need for safe and convenient loading space for visitors or patrons and goods arriving by motor transport. 
                  7.  Additional off-street parking regulations for commercial establishments. 
                  (a)  The commercial establishments to be served by new parking spaces shall be conforming uses. 
                  (b)  The remote off-street parking spaces shall either adjoin the commercial district on the same side of the street or shall be directly across the street from a commercial district. 
                  (c)  The proposed design and proposed location of such remote off-street parking facilities shall be approved by the board of zoning appeals. 
                  8.  Continuing character of obligation. The schedule of requirements in this chapter for off-street service space shall be a continuing obligation. It shall be unlawful for any owner of any land or building affected by this chapter to discontinue, change, or dispense with such off-street parking or loading facilities without establishing alternate off-street parking or loading facilities, which comply with the requirements of this chapter. 
                  9.  Parking of large vehicles. 
                  (a)  No parking of vehicles described in paragraph (b) herein below shall be allowed in a public right-of-way within the Town of Thunderbolt except as set forth in paragraph (b) herein below. All other vehicles shall be allowed to park in a public right-of-way within the Town of Thunderbolt provided the parking of vehicles in the public right-of-way of the Town of Thunderbolt shall not impede emergency vehicle traffic and, if possible, any vehicle allowed to be parked in the public right-of-way shall be off the paved portion of the right-of-way. 
                  (b)  Parking of motor homes, trailers, tiny house, semitrailers, or truck tractors in the Town of Thunderbolt prohibited. No motor vehicle exceeding 20 feet in length and/or 10,000 lbs. gross vehicular weight or any recreational vehicle, motor coach, tiny house, camper, trailer, semitrailer, or truck tractor, or part of any such vehicle shall be parked upon the any right of way of the town except: 
                  (1)  Any motor vehicle being used by public utility, moving company or similar company while it is being used to provide their services to a residential property or transporting residential goods or products; 
                  (2)  Any motor vehicle used in a construction site during a period that construction is actually taking place, including non-working hours and holidays; 
                  (c)  Storing of tiny house, semitrailers, or cab of semi-trailer in residential zones prohibited:

                  9.1  Solid waste storage and disposal facilities. 
                  (a)  Purpose . The purpose of this section is to ensure that adequate provision be made for the placement and location of solid waste and storage disposal facilities in the development plans for new construction. These provisions are an effort to avoid conditions that could lead to health hazards, unsightliness, inefficient collection systems, and improper use of available land. 
                  (b)  Duty to provide and maintain. The establishment, expansion, or modification of multi-family and nonresidential uses shall require provision for storage and disposal facilities. 
                  (c)  Approval by zoning administrator.

                  ( Ord of 3-8-2016 ) 
                  ARTICLE XI. - SPECIAL USE REGULATIONS 
                  1.  Bed and breakfast ordinance. There are two types of bed and breakfast uses defined in this ordinance, a bed and breakfast and a bed and breakfast inn. A bed and breakfast is permitted in certain residential areas and intended to be residential in nature. Any slight diversion from the bed and breakfast parameters will change a residential use to a commercial use. A bed and breakfast inn is intended for commercial districts only. Therefore, there can be no variance from the regulations specific to a bed and breakfast. Such a variance will alter the use of the property and thus require a change in the zoning district. The regulations that list requirements for both types of bed and breakfast uses are as follows: 
                  Bed and breakfast (residential). Limited to no more than five rental units consisting of sleeping and sanitary accommodations, and one dwelling unit to be owner occupied. The owner is required to live on premise and agree to make available proof of residency. Food service limited to breakfast for guests only and to be served between the hours of 5:00 a.m.—12:00 noon. Under no circumstances will an alcoholic beverage license be issued. No less than one off street parking space per rental unit, and a minimum of two parking spaces for the owner. A buffer is required with a minimum height of six feet. One on premise sign, not to exceed 12 square feet, may either be posted on the building or on a post. A post sign may not exceed a height of six feet from the highest point of the sign. A post sign is to be located no nearer than ten feet of the right-of-way. No signs are to be allowed that are illuminated from within. Post signs may be lit with no more than two spotlights with a maximum wattage of 75 watts per bulb located on each side of the sign. Sign posted on building may be lit with no more than one spotlight with wattage not to exceed 75 watts. All sign designs must be submitted as part of the conditional use permit drawn using a ¼-inch scale. A public hearing before mayor and council is required. This permit is only valid as long as all conditions specified are met. 
                  Bed and breakfast inns (commercial). These land uses are subject to an approved site development plan as required for all commercial development. 
                  2.  Hotel-motel ordinance . Any area designated or to be designated for development of hotels or motels. This district shall be composed of land and structures so situated as to be well adapted to hotel or motel development where the proximity to residential and commercial districts makes it desirable to limit the manner and extent of hotel or motel operations. Development within this district is subject to approval of the governing body. The purpose of this district is to permit the normal operation of a limited number of motel and/or hotel uses under such conditions or operations as will protect the abutting residential and commercial use or other adjacent uses. 
                  Uses permitted. Unless otherwise permitted by this ordinance, no building, land or structure shall be used except for the following: 
                  1.  Motels; 
                  2.  Hotels. 
                  Conditional uses. All other uses not listed as a permitted use shall be subject to approval following a determination of conditions of fact as follows: 
                  1.  The development of such transient lodging use of the location proposed, and in the manner proposed, will not adversely affect the abutting residential and commercial property and other adjoining uses. 
                  2.  The site development for such a transient lodging facility provides for adequate vehicular and pedestrian access and circulation, and the resulting concentration of vehicular traffic will not present traffic problems or impede normal movement on the adjacent streets. 
                  3.  The need for such use is justified on the basis of facts presented by the applicant to the planning and zoning commission which clearly indicates such use would be appropriate, add to the orderly development of the community, and would further the propose and intent of this ordinance. 
                  Permitted uses and conditional uses shall meet the standards set forth here in below: 
                  (1)  Building footprint . Building and fixed structures for such development shall use no more than 50 percent of the square footage of the lot or lots upon which the development is built. 
                  (2)  Height and setbacks. 
                  a.  Height requirements shall be controlled by section 5-201(2)(B) of the general ordinances of the Town of Thunderbolt. 
                  If a variance in the height is requested and approved, setbacks from the front, rear and side property lines shall be increased two feet for every foot above the 36-foot maximum height requirement. 
                  b.  Minimum front yard setbacks from the property line shall be: 
                  1.  Major arterial street: 85 feet. 
                  2.  Minor or marginal access street: 75 feet. 
                  c.  Minimum side yard setback shall be 15 feet. 
                  d.  Minimum rear set-back lines shall be 30 feet. 
                  (3)  Parking . 
                  a.  There shall be a minimum of one parking space allowed for each guest room and an additional parking space for each two employees. Additionally, there shall be one parking space for each four seats in a restaurant, lounge or outdoor seating area. 
                  b.  Remote parking may be made available for overflow parking only and may not be used to satisfy the requirements stated above. Remote parking shall be located within 600 feet of the hotel/motel. If remote parking is located on a lot designated as R-l or R-2 not more than 25 percent of any such lot may be used for parking. 
                  (4)  Off-street loading. In addition to parking, off-street loading space shall be provided. Such space shall be sufficient to accommodate the maximum number of trucks that would be loading, unloading or stored at any one time; provided. However, that there shall be a minimum of one off-street loading space for each 10,000 square feet of total floor area or fraction thereof. Each such loading space shall not be less than ten feet wide and shall be of such length as is necessary to accommodate the type of cab or truck or bus that will be loading or unloading or parking on a temporary basis. Such loading or unloading space shall not be less than 30 feet in length. Such loading and unloading spaces, including maneuvering space shall be located entirely off street. All such required off street loading and unloading spaces shall be located on the same lot as the building which they are intended to serve. 
                  (5)  Buffers and green space. 
                  (a)  Green space. Sixty-five percent of the designated setback area of a lot shall consist of permanent permeable surface so as to permit the absorption of water and shall not be paved, built upon or covered with manmade material in such a manner so as to interfere with the permeability of the surface. 
                  (b)  Buffers . Where off street parking, loading or surface areas are proposed to be located closer than 50 feet to a lot in an R zoning district or to any lot upon which there exists a dwelling as a permitted use, and where such parking, loading or service areas are not entirely screened visually from such lot by an intervening building or structure, there shall be provided along such lot line a continuous visual buffer of a minimum of six feet. No such buffer shall extend nearer to a street right-of-way line than the established building line of the adjoining residential lot, and no buffer shall be required along a property line immediately adjoining and parallel to a lane. The buffer shall be of a width determined by the governing body, and shall contain within such width a compact evergreen hedge or other type of foliage screening, or combined fence and shrubbery screen, the latter facing the adjoining residential lot. 
                  (c)  Number of trees. If the lot or lots to be built upon contain any trees greater than six inches in diameter such trees shall be identified on a landscape plan both before the project begins and after the project is completed. All green space and buffers shall also be required to be shown on such plans. The pre-project site plan shall be reviewed by the planning and zoning commission who shall make any recommendations or changes it deems advisable to the proposed site plan to the governing body. 
                  (6)  Hotel/motel structure and improvements. 
                  (a)  All hotels and motels shall be constructed in a manner that the rooms are accessed only through an interior hallway. There shall not be any exterior collecting balconies, porches or walkways. 
                  (b)  Sidewalks for pedestrians with curbing and guttering along public paved streets shall be required with such cost to be borne by the developer of the hotel/motel facility. 
                  3.  Personal care homes. A home in which protective care and a watchful oversight is given a resident who needs a watchful environment, but does not have an illness, injury or disability which requires chronic or convalescent care including medical and nursing services. Protective care and watchful oversight includes, but is not limited to, a daily awareness by the management of the resident's functioning, his or her whereabouts, the making and reminding a resident of appointments for medical checkups, the ability to intervene if a crises arises for a resident, supervision in the areas of nutrition, medication and actual provision of transient medical care with 24-hour responsibility for the well-being of the resident but not including facilities for the care of persons suffering from drug addiction, abuse and/or alcoholism (while in recovery rehabilitation or halfway house programs and treatments). 
                  Personal care homes shall be designated in one of three categories as follows: 
                  A.  Family personal care home . A home for the elderly or handicapped adults (in a residence or other type building(s), non-institutional in character), licensed, inspected and regulated by the State of Georgia, offering care for up to six ambulatory persons. Care is limited to six ambulatory persons unless a zoning variance is requested. 
                  B.  Family care home for the mental retarded . A home for individuals who are classified as mentally retarded, which is licensed, inspected and regulated by a State of Georgia agency or by the Georgia Department of Human Resources, and which is under the supervision of a certified state or public local welfare employee. Residents participate in day training or educational programs or are employed outside the home when not under the care of a resident supervisor. Care is limited to six ambulatory persons unless a zoning variance is requested. 
                  C.  Personal care home for conditions other than allowed in a family personal care home or a family care home for the mentally retarded. A home for services to patients for other medical conditions not listed in the first two definitions (A and B). (Note: "Ambulatory" is defined that a person is able to move around and not confined to bed.) 
                  4.  Shipping containers/portable storage units. 
                  (a)  Prohibition . Notwithstanding any other provision (and in particular the definition of "accessory use") of the Zoning Ordinance of the Town of Thunderbolt, except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, it shall be unlawful for any person, firm or other entity to move into the Town of Thunderbolt or erect, any metal containers, shipping containers, other containers sometimes referred to as "PODS" or "MINIS," or any similar container unit originally designed expressly for storage purposes. 
                  (b)  Conditional use. In zoning districts designated WI, or B any such structures or container described in subsection (a) herein above (herein after referred to as "storage units") may be placed upon property in such districts as a conditional use. When considering whether such storage units shall be allowed on any given property in the above referred to zoning districts as a conditional use the zoning commission when making a recommendation or the zoning board of appeals when making a determination shall consider the following: 
                  1.  Whether the property in question is adjacent to a residential zoning district. 
                  2.  Whether the storage units can be placed adequately screened with fencing or other appropriate buffer so as not to be seen from the adjoining property or public right-of-way. 
                  3.  Whether the storage units can be placed upon the property in question outside of public parking areas so as not to diminish parking requirements and so as not to obstruct vehicular traffic or emergency vehicles. 
                  4.  Whether the proposed storage unit is intended to be used on a temporary basis of less than three months or on a long term basis of three months or more. 
                  5.  Whether the applicant is asking for space for one or multiple storage units and the total square feet that is being requested to be used for storage units in relation to the total area of the property. 
                  In considering the criteria set forth herein above, the zoning commission when making a recommendation or the board of zoning appeals when making a determination shall apply minimum criteria as follows: 
                  1.  Storage units shall not be stacked except in a WI district and in such district no higher than the buffer approved by the town. All storage units in either a WI or B district shall have fencing or other buffering at least as high as the storage unit. In a WI district the top of the storage units may extend from the ground upward no more than 30 feet except when the storage site on the subject property is of sufficient distance from any public road or adjoining property that when standing on the adjacent property or the public right-of-way the storage units would not be able to be seen because of other buildings, structures or permanent vegetation on the subject property in which event the fencing or other buffering requirements shall be at the discretion of the zoning commission when making a recommendation or the zoning board of appeals when making a decision concerning the requested conditional use. All storage units shall under any circumstances also comply with the general ordinances of the Town of Thunderbolt and also comply with the building codes so that adequate foundations are in place for any allowed storage unit. 
                  2.  Storage units shall not be placed within 25 feet of any side or rear property line or within 25 feet of any power line. Storage units shall not be placed any closer to a (a) front property line or (b) rear or side lot property line that is adjacent to a street right-of-way than (1) the required front setback for the property, (2) the front of the nearest structure to the front property line, or (3) 25 feet whichever distance is greater from the street right-of-way. 
                  (c)  Permit . After meeting the conditions set forth herein and any special conditions imposed by the town a conditional use permit and building permit must be obtained from the appropriate town official. 
                  (See article XV of the Zoning Ordinance for initial application requirements). 
                  (d)  Exception . 
                  1.  A storage unit that is to be placed on property in any district but is to remain on the property for seven days or less shall not be subject to the requirements set forth herein. 
                  2.  Small metal buildings (sometimes referred to as "handi-houses") or other types of sheds or storage facilities not exceeding exterior square footage of 120 square feet shall not be considered "storage units" as defined in this ordinance and shall be allowed in zoning districts allowing such a use in the Town of Thunderbolt provided, however, such buildings or structures shall still meet setback requirements for the zoning district in which they are placed or erected and the building code requirements shall still be met by the owner of the property before such structure is erected or placed upon the property. 
                  3.  Storage units placed upon any property for construction purposes shall be allowed on the property from commencement of construction as commencement of construction is defined in chapter 5 article II section 5-201(2)(c) of the ordinances of the Town of Thunderbolt and such storage units shall only be allowed to stay on the property during the length of construction but in no event longer than one year and if construction is not completed within one year and the building permit is extended for no more than an additional six months. 
                  (e)  Nonconforming uses. Storage units as defined herein which are non conforming uses shall become subject to the rules concerning fencing or other appropriate buffering within 120 days of being notified by an appropriate town official to bring the nonconforming use into compliance with the buffering requirements contained in this ordinance. 
                  (f)  Removal . Any storage unit which becomes obsolete, not structurally safe, unclean or in disrepair, or does not meet or maintain the buffering requirements as required herein the discretion of the city building official or code enforcement officer or becomes a nuisance shall be subject to an order of removal. The building official or code enforcement officer shall notify the permittee of any such storage unit to make the unit safe, clean, or in good repair, and/or to meet the buffering requirements. If such corrections are not made within 30 days of such written notice to the permittee, the storage unit shall be considered obsolete and the storage unit shall be permanently removed. If the storage unit is considered a nuisance the procedure for removal of a nuisance found in the town's general ordinances shall be followed. It is the intent of this section that if a storage unit meets any of the above requirements for removal or if a storage unit is found to be a nuisance that it not be allowed to be replaced. 
                  (g)  Conflict/repeal. All ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflict herewith are expressly repealed. 
                  (h)  Constitutionality . If any portion of this ordinance shall be held invalid or unconstitutional, such invalidity or unconstitutionality shall not affect or impair the remaining portions unless it clearly appears that such other parts are wholly and necessarily dependent upon the part to be held invalid or unconstitutional.

                  ARTICLE XIII. - SIGN ORDINANCE 
                  I.  Purpose and findings . The town council has considered the aesthetic and safety reasons for limiting signage within the Town of Thunderbolt. The council has determined that signs can detract from the aesthetic beauty of the town which is located in the scenic Georgia coastal and wetland setting. Further, unregulated sign proliferation may contribute to a lowering of commercial and residential property values. Lastly, signs can be detrimental to the safety of motorists in the town which has a substantial road way, Victory Drive, passing through it. It has been found by the council by limiting the number, type, location, and dimension of signs in accordance with the following regulations will serve these substantial governmental and community interests. 
                  In furtherance of the above stated goals the Town of Thunderbolt affirms the goals of the C.U.T.S. Transportation Amenities Program that was adopted by the City of Savannah and Chatham County and was also adopted by the Town of Thunderbolt on September 10, 2003 and notes that one of the goals of the C.U.T.S. Transportation Amenities Program is to protect and preserve canopy and palm lined historic roads. In such regard the Town of Thunderbolt hereby names Victory Drive within the jurisdiction of the Town of Thunderbolt as an amenities corridor. 
                  The council is well aware that signs are an important means by which the town's residents, organizations, institutions, and businesses convey constitutionally protected commercial and noncommercial messages. The following regulations provide an appropriate balance between the right to communicate via signs and the protection of the community interests stated above. 
                  The council recognizes that it is rarely proper for the government to determine the content of speech that will be allowed on signs. As such, it is the intent of the council that except as specified by the state's statutes, rules and regulations signs will be approved or disapproved entirely without regard to the content to be posted on all signs. 
                  II.  Definitions specific to this article XIII . 
                  Administrator means the town administrator or clerk or the authorized designee of the town administrator or clerk.

In addition to the seven appointed members of the zoning commission there may be appointed by the mayor and council two alternate members to serve when a member of the commission is unable to attend any regular or called meeting of the commission and the chairman of the commission or the secretary of the commission at the direction of the chairman of the commission is able to contact one or both alternate members to attend a commission meeting so that there will be a quorum of the commission and business can therefore be conducted. At any time that a regular member of the commission misses three consecutive meetings the chairman of the commission may request that the mayor and council remove any such commission member from his/her position on the commission and replace such member with one of the alternates for the remainder of the term of the commission member who has been removed. In such event the mayor and council may then appoint a new alternate to fill the vacancy in the alternate membership of the commission. 
                  B.  Term of office. The terms of the members shall be for four years, except that in the appointment of the first planning commission appointed pursuant to this revision to the zoning ordinance, one member shall be appointed for a term of one year, two members shall be appointed for a term of two years, two members shall be appointed for a term of three years and the remaining member shall be appointed for a term of four years each. Any vacancy in membership shall be filled for the unexpired term by the governing body, which shall also have the authority to remove any member for cause, on written charges, after a public hearing. 
                  C.  Compensation . All members shall be paid $50.00 per month provided they attend the meeting for that month. Payment of the remuneration to the member shall be made on a semi-annual basis in July and December. Members of the commission may also be reimbursed for actual expenses incurred in connection with their official duties, if approved by the mayor and council. 
                  3.  Officers, meetings, quorum, minutes—Procedures generally. The members of the planning and zoning commission shall appoint a chairman from the membership. If the membership does not appoint a chairman by February 28 of each calendar year to serve for that year, the mayor and council shall appoint one of the members of the planning and zoning commission as chairman, who shall serve for such year or until he is re-appointed or his successor is appointed. The planning and zoning commission shall appoint a secretary who may be an officer or employee of the town. The planning and zoning commission shall have authority to adopt rules of procedure. 
                  In addition to regularly scheduled meetings on the third Wednesday of each month, meetings of the planning and zoning commission shall be held at the call of the chairman and at such other times as the commission may determine. Four members of the commission shall constitute a quorum. 
                  The planning and zoning commission shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question, or if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of recommendations and studies, all of which shall be immediately filed in town hall and shall be a public record. Meetings and hearings conducted by the planning and zoning commission may be adjourned from time to time and, if the time and place of the continued hearing be publicly announced at the time of the adjournment, no further notice of such continued hearings shall be required; otherwise, notice thereof shall be given, as in the case of the original hearing.

                  ( Ord. of 3-9-2016 ) 
                  ARTICLE XVIII. - AMENDMENTS 
                  1.  Amendments . This chapter, including the zoning map, may be amended by the mayor and council on their own motion, on petition, or on recommendation of the planning and zoning commission, but no amendment shall become effective unless it shall have been proposed or shall first have been submitted to the Thunderbolt Planning and Zoning Commission for review and recommendation. Before enacting an amendment to this chapter, the mayor and council shall give public notice and hold a public hearing thereon as set forth in this article. 
                  2.  Procedure for amendment. 
                  (a)  Generally . Applications for amendment of this ordinance may be filed with the town zoning administrator. The proposed amendments to this ordinance may be proposals for text or map amendments. Such applications shall give the reasons for requesting change of the text and/or zoning map, which would support the purposes of the zoning program. A property owner shall not file a rezoning petition for a map or text amendment affecting the same parcel more often than 12 months from the date of denial of any rezoning request for the same property by the mayor and council, or within 12 months of the date of a recommendation by the planning and zoning commission for denial of an application affecting the same parcel. All previous applications for a text or map amendment affecting the same premises shall be listed. The fee for filing an application for amendment and all related fees shall be subject to the current fee schedule as approved by town council. (Please see zoning administrator for current fee schedule.) 
                  (b)  Signature of applicant. All applications shall be signed and shall state the name and address of the applicant, who must be the owner of the property or the authorized agent or attorney for the owner of the property. If the applicant is the agent of the owner then said agent shall file, simultaneously with said petition, a notarized letter signed by the owner, authorizing said agent to file on his behalf. No application shall be accepted which fails to meet these requirements. 
                  (c)  Application for text amendment. In the case of a text amendment, the application shall set forth the new text to be added and the existing text to be deleted. 
                  (d)  Application for map amendment. An application for a map amendment shall include the following information and a scaled map or plat, which shall be attached to each of the application forms required. Said map or plat shall show the property referred to in the application and all adjoining lots or parcels of land which are also under the same ownership and include: 
                  (1)  A legal description of the land by lot, block, and subdivision designations, or if none, by metes and bounds. 
                  (2)  The property identification number from the tax records of Chatham County. 
                  (3)  The present zoning classification and the classification proposed for such land. 
                  (4)  The name and address of the owners of the land. 
                  (5)  The present and proposed land uses of the property petitioned for rezoning and all adjoining properties if under the same ownership. 
                  (6)  The names, address and zip codes, at the date of filing of owners of property being rezoned and of property owners within 200 feet of the property and across any public right-of-way from the property being proposed for rezoning, including properties diagonally across an intersection. 
                  After acceptance of an application, the zoning administrator shall transmit a copy thereof to the planning and zoning commission for its review and recommendation. The planning and zoning commission shall submit its findings to the town council within 90 days from the date the application was accepted by the zoning administrator; provided that such application was accepted at least 20 days prior to its next regularly scheduled meeting. If the planning and zoning commission fails to submit a report within the time period set forth above, the application shall be submitted to the town council without any recommendation by the planning and zoning commission. 
                  At least seven days prior to the planning and zoning commission meeting on the application, applicant shall mail by certified mail, return receipt requested, notice of the date, time, place of the planning and zoning commission hearing on the application to the property owners adjacent to and across any public right-of-way from the property being proposed for rezoning, including properties diagonally across an intersection. Proof of mailing, by applicant, must be provided to the zoning administrator. 
                  (e)  Posting of property. 
                  (1)  Erection of signs. At least 15 days prior to the scheduled date of the public hearing before the mayor and council on the application for a map amendment, the applicant shall erect a sign at applicant's expense on the land proposed to be reclassified. Such sign shall be erected by the applicant within ten feet of whatever boundary line of such land abuts the most traveled public road; and, if no public road abuts thereon, then such sign shall be erected to face in such a manner as may be most readily seen by the public. The lower edge of the sign face shall be of sufficient height so as to be read from the roadway. The sign shall show the present zoning classification, the proposed zoning classification, the scheduled date, time, and place of public hearing and the telephone number to call for further information. If the land sought to be rezoned lies within more than one block, as shown on a plat recorded in the land records of the county, additional signs shall be placed to give general area coverage. Any such sign(s) shall be maintained at all times by the applicant until a decision on the application has been made public by the governing authority. Once the application is disposed of, the applicant must remove and dispose of the sign within ten days. 
                  (f)  Hearing procedure. 
                  (1)  Hearing called. Before taking action on a proposed amendment, the mayor and council shall hold a public hearing thereon. At least 15 days' notice and not more than 45 days' notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the town. Such notice shall state the application number and shall contain a summary of the proposed amendment, if a text amendment, and in the case of a map amendment, the location of the property, name of owner, and the proposed change or classification. 
                  (2)  Notice of interested parties. At least seven days prior to the date of the public hearing a notice setting forth the date, time and place for such public hearing shall be sent by the zoning administrator by regular mail to the applicant, the planning and zoning commission, and all owners of property located adjacent to or across a public right-of-way from the property being proposed for rezoning. The names and addresses of owners of such properties shall be provided by the applicant as set forth herein, provided, however, where a map amendment is initiated by the planning and zoning commission such names and address of owners of property located adjacent to or across a public right-of-way from property being proposed for rezoning shall be provided by the zoning administrator. Notwithstanding any other provision hereinabove if the planning and zoning commission or the mayor and council themselves initiate a rezoning matter involving more than one parcel of land and all owners of property located adjacent to or across the public right-of-way from the property being proposed for rezoning constitute more than 30 such owners the notice to interested parties shall be accomplished by advertisement in the appropriate newspaper for the County of Chatham that advertises legal advertisements, said advertisement to be run once a week for two weeks prior to the date of the public hearing. 
                  (g)  Procedure for conducting a public hearing. 
                  (1)  All public hearings by the mayor and council on zoning amendments shall be chaired by the mayor (presiding officer). 
                  (2)  The mayor shall open the hearing by stating the specific zoning amendment being considered at the public hearing. 
                  (3)  The mayor shall determine the number of attendees who desire to testify or present evidence at the hearing. 
                  (4)  When there are a large number of individuals wishing to testify at a hearing, the Mayor may invoke time limits on individual speakers. In such cases, these time limits shall apply to all speakers. Notwithstanding, any other provisions of this article, the proponents and opponents to any zoning petition shall be granted a minimum of ten minutes per side for an amount in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 36-66-5(a) as such provision is amended. 
                  (5)  The mayor shall recognize the individual parties wishing to testify or present evidence and allow them to present this information. 
                  (6)  Once all parties have concluded their testimony, the mayor shall adjourn the public hearing. 
                  (h)  Standards and criteria for making zoning amendments. However, prior to making a zoning amendment, the mayor and council shall evaluate the merits of a proposed zoning amendment according to the following criteria: The planning and zoning commission may evaluate any proposed zoning amendments according to the following criteria and, if used, should be included in their recommendation to the mayor and council. 
                  (1)  Is this request a logical extension of a zoning boundary, which would improve the pattern of uses in the general area? 
                  (2)  Is this spot zoning and generally unrelated to either existing zoning or the pattern of development in the area? 
                  (3)  Could traffic created by the proposed use or other use permissible under the zoning sought traverse established single-family neighborhoods on minor streets, leading to congestion, noise, and traffic hazards? 
                  (4)  Will this request place irreversible limitations on the area as it is or on future plans for it? 
                  (5)  Is there an eminent needs for the rezoning and is the property likely to be used for the use requested? 
                  (6)  Will the proposed use substantially conflict with existing density patterns in the zone or neighborhood? 
                  (7)  Would the proposed use precipitate similar requests which would generate or accelerate adverse land use changes in the zone or neighborhood? 
                  (8)  Will the action adversely impact adjacent or nearby properties in terms of: 
                  (i)  Environmental quality or livability, resulting from the introduction of uses or activities which would create traffic, noise, odor or visual hazards or the reduction of light and air that is incompatible with the established development pattern. 
                  (ii)  Property values, by rendering such properties less suitable and therefore less marketable for the type of development to which they are committed or restricted in order to promote the public welfare and protect the established development pattern. 
                  (9)  Will the action create development opportunities of such increased intensity that storm water run-off from the site cannot be controlled within previous limits, which results in adverse impacts upon existing downstream drainage problems or potential problems? 
                  (10)  Will the action result in public service requirements such as provision of utilities or safety services which, because of the location or scale of the development, cannot be provided on an economic basis and therefore would create an actual burden to the public? 
                  ARTICLE XIX. - INTERPRETATION, PURPOSE AND CONFLICT
