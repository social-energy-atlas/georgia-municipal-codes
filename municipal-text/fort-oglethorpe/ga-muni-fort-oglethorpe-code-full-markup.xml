PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1986 Code, as supplemented through October 28, 1991, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1986 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Palmer Carr, Supervising Editor, and John Welch, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Virginia J. Smith, City Manager, and Mr. Stephen B. Farrow, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

The complaint shall be filed with the city manager or city attorney. Upon receipt of a complaint, the city manager or city attorney shall randomly draw the names of three members from the board of ethics pool. The three members, along with the city attorney as legal counsel, shall constitute an investigating committee to determine whether the complaint sets forth significant facts and circumstances so as to warrant a hearing before the board of ethics. The investigating committee shall have the right to request supporting documentation from the complaining party if the committee deems it reasonable to avoid the pursuit of frivolous complaints. If the complaint does not set forth sufficient facts to constitute an alleged violation and is found unjustified, frivolous, or patently unfounded, it shall be dismissed, and the complainant notified immediately. If the complaint is found to state sufficient facts to warrant a hearing before the board of ethics, the board shall be appointed as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection. 
                  (2)  The board of ethics of the city shall be composed of seven registered voters of the city to be appointed as provided in this paragraph. Each member of the board of ethics shall have been a resident of the city for at least one year immediately preceding the date of taking office and shall remain a resident of the city while serving as a member of the board of ethics. No person shall serve as a member of the board of ethics if the person has, or has had within the preceding one-year period, any interest in any contract, transaction, or official action of the city. The mayor and council shall each appoint three qualified registered voters of the city to provide a pool of 18 individuals who have consented to serve as a member of such board of ethics and who will be available for a period of the term of their appointer to be called upon to serve in the event a board of ethics is appointed. The city attorney shall maintain a listing of these 18 qualified registered voters of the city. Should the investigating committee determine a complaint warrants a hearing before the board of ethics, the mayor and council, at the first public meeting after such determination, shall draw names randomly from the listing of qualified citizens until the specified seven members of the board of ethics have been appointed. Such board shall elect one of its members to serve as chairperson. The governing authority of the city shall provide a meeting space for the board of ethics. Subject to budgetary procedures and requirements of the city, the city shall provide the board of ethics with such supplies and equipment as may be reasonably necessary for it to perform its duties and responsibilities. 
                  (3)  Duties and powers. The constituted board of ethics shall have the following duties and powers:

                  (C)  Prescribe forms, approved by the city attorney, for the disclosure required in this section and to make available to the public information disclosed as provided in this subsection; 
                  (D)  Receive and hear complaints of violations of the standards required by this section; 
                  (E)  Make such investigation and response to a complaint as it deems necessary to determine whether any person has violated any provisions of this section; 
                  (F)  Hold such hearings and make such inquires as deemed necessary to investigate and rule upon complaints; and 
                  (G)  Report its findings to the governing authority for such action as the governing authority deems appropriate. 
                  (m)  (1)  In the event the investigating committee determines a complaint warrants a hearing, the board of ethics, as appointed in this section, shall cause the complaint to be served on the member of the governing authority charged as soon as practicable. Service may be by personal service or by certified mail, return receipt requested. A hearing shall be held within 60 days after filing of the complaint. The board of ethics shall conduct the hearing in accordance with the procedures and regulations it establishes, but in all circumstances, the hearing shall include the taking of testimony and the cross-examination of witnesses. The decision of the board of ethics shall be rendered to the mayor and council within five days after completion of the hearing. 
                  (2)  Any member of the governing authority who knowingly violates any provision of this section shall be subject to public reprimand, censure, or removal from office or a fine not to exceed $1,000.00, or both, by the governing authority of the city. 
                  (3)  At any hearing held by the board of ethics, the member of the governing authority who is the subject of inquiry shall have the right to written notice of the allegations at least ten business days before a hearing, to be represented by counsel, to hear and examine the evidence and witnesses, and to present evidence and witnesses in opposition or in extenuation. 
                  (n)  (1)  Any member of the governing authority or the complainant adversely affected by these findings of the board of ethics may obtain judicial review of such decision as provided in this subsection. 
                  (2)  An action for judicial review may be commenced by filing an application for a writ of certiorari in the superior court of the county within 30 days after the decision of the mayor and council. The filing of such application shall act as supersedes.

Included in the sales contract shall be a provision for the rights-of-way of said street, avenue, alley, or public place. Each abutting property owner shall be notified of the availability of the property and given the opportunity to purchase said property under such terms and conditions as set out by ordinance. All deeds and conveyances heretofore and hereafter so executed and delivered shall convey all title and interest the city has in such property, notwithstanding the fact that no public sale after advertisement was or is hereafter made.

                  (1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions. 
                  (2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles.

Once an individual completes his comments he should sit down. Any group or organization present for public comment shall designate a spokesman. 
                  (2)  Public participation on agenda items. The council may allow public comment on an agenda item at the time the item is being considered by the council. These comments must be limited to the subject that is being debated. Members of the public may speak for five minutes and may only speak once. These limits can be waived by the council. Anyone wishing to speak at any council meeting must be recognized by the mayor before addressing the council and must stand and state his name when recognized by the mayor. 
                  (3)  Decorum. Members of the public shall not make inappropriate or offensive comments at a council meeting and are expected to comply with the rules of decorum that are established for the mayor and council. Individuals who violate any rules of the mayor and council may be ruled out of order by the mayor or on a point of order made by a councilmember. An individual who violates the rules of decorum may be removed from the meeting at the direction of the mayor. 
                  (4)  Public hearings. The council may schedule public hearings for the purposes of soliciting public comment on any subject of interest to the council. Hearings may be held immediately prior to or following a meeting of the council or at such other places and times as the council may determine. No official action shall be taken at any such public hearing.

                  Any proposed amendments to the rules of order must be submitted by a councilmember in writing to the city manager by 4:30 p.m. on the Thursday before a regular meeting of the city council.

                  Sec. 2-50. - Executive sessions. 
                  (a)  Executive sessions of the city council may be held for the purpose of conducting business excepted from public access requirements as authorized by O.C.G.A. §§ 50-14-2 and 50-14-3. Where a meeting of the council is devoted in part to matters within the authorized exceptions to public access requirements, any portion of the meeting not subject to any such exception shall be opened to the public. No executive session shall be held except pursuant to an affirmative vote as defined by the Charter. 
                  (b)  The minutes of the public meeting shall reflect the names of the councilmembers present, those voting for the executive session, and the specific reasons for the executive session. Minutes of the executive session shall be maintained by the city manager. Any such minutes shall be maintained in a confidential file and shall not be subject to disclosure; except that disclosures of such portions of the minutes identifying real estate to be acquired by the council may only be delayed until such time as acquisition of the real estate has been completed, terminated or abandoned, or court proceedings have been initiated.

                  Sec. 2-51. - Committees. 
                  The mayor, with a concurrence of the city council, may create committees of members of the council to study any issue before the council. Any such committees may make recommendations to the council, but no committee shall be empowered to make any final decision on any matter before it for consideration. In addition to councilmembers, committees may include other city officials, staff or citizens at large. The mayor shall serve as an ex officio member of all committees.

                  Sec. 2-53. - Ordinances and resolutions. 
                  (a)  An ordinance is the equivalent of a statute and is a legal enactment by the city council. An ordinance is to be distinguished from a resolution, which is merely a formal expression of the opinion or will of the city council, the subject matter of which would not constitute a statute. 
                  (b)  Any requested ordinance or resolution requested by any councilmember and/or private citizen shall be submitted in writing by 4:30 p.m. on the Thursday prior to the next regular meeting of the council. Any resolution or ordinance which is to be adopted shall be in written form. Although a resolution can be adopted on its date of introduction, an ordinance shall not be adopted until its third reading, after having been read for the first two times at regular meetings of the council. Notices of ordinances which have been given a first reading may be published as directed by the council. This notice need not be a verbatim rendering of the ordinance, but need only specify the subject matter of such ordinance to allow the public to obtain a copy from city hall if there is further interest.

                  Sec. 2-54. - Main motion. 
                  In order for the city council to take any official action on any subject, a councilmember must propose a main motion. A proposed main motion will not be recognized by the mayor until another councilmember agrees to second the motion. A second does not require the councilmember seconding the motion to support the motion. A councilmember may withdraw a main motion that he has made at any time before the council has voted on that motion. 
                  (Ord. No. 1-94, § 2-01, 10-24-1994) 
                  Sec. 2-55. - Debate. 
                  (a)  After the main motion is recognized by the mayor, the city council shall debate the motion. The debate shall be managed by the mayor in a manner that is fair to all councilmembers. Councilmembers can participate in the debate only when they are recognized by the mayor. 
                  (b)  During the course of debate, councilmembers may introduce subsidiary motions that propose that the council take a particular action on a motion (section 2-58). There are two classes of subsidiary motions: debatable subsidiary motions and undebatable subsidiary motions. Debatable subsidiary motions consist of motions to postpone indefinitely, amend, refer to committee, and postpone to a time certain. Debatable subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. There are three undebatable subsidiary motions: limit debate, vote immediately, and lay on the table. They require a second and cannot be debated. 
                  (c)  Councilmembers may also introduce privileged motions (section 2-59). Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting and can be introduced during the course of debate. Privileged motions consist of a motion to raise a question of privilege and motions to recess and adjourn. The motions to recess and adjourn require a second. Debate is not allowed on privileged motions. 
                  (Ord. No. 1-94, § 2-02, 10-24-1994) 
                  Sec. 2-56. - Voting procedure. 
                  Voting on debatable motions and voting on undebatable motions shall take place in accordance with the following provisions: 
                  (1)  Debatable motions. In the case of debatable motions, the vote can be proposed in one of two ways: 
                  a.  If debate has been completed and no other councilmember wishes to speak, the mayor can call for the vote; and if there are no objections, the mayor can proceed with the vote. 
                  b.  If the mayor calls for the vote and there is an objection, a councilmember may move to vote immediately ("move the previous question"). If this motion is seconded and approved by at least three councilmembers, the debate will stop. The mayor will then read the proposed motion to the city council and ask for the votes of the councilmembers. 
                  (2)  Undebatable motions. In the case of undebatable motions, the vote shall occur immediately after the motion is recognized by the mayor. The mayor shall read the proposed motion to the council and then call for the vote. 
                  (Ord. No. 1-94, § 2-03, 10-24-1994) 
                  Sec. 2-57. - Ranking of motions. 
                  (a)  Each subsidiary and privileged motion is assigned a specific rank. A motion of higher precedence can interrupt a motion for lower precedence. The higher motion must be decided before the city council returns to consider the motion of lower precedence. 
                  (b)  A main motion has the lowest rank and does not take precedence over any other motion. A motion to adjourn has the highest rank and will take precedence over all other subsidiary and privileged motions. The order of precedence of motions shall be in accordance with this section. Motions at the bottom of the following list take precedence over motions at the top of the list. 
                  LOWEST RANK: 
                  a.  Main motion. 
                  Subsidiary motions (debatable): 
                  b.  Postpone indefinitely. 
                  c.  Amend. 
                  d.  Refer to committee (commit). 
                  e.  Postpone to a time certain (postpone definitely). 
                  Subsidiary motions (undebatable): 
                  f.  Limit debate or extend limits. 
                  g.  Vote immediately (previous question). 
                  h.  Lay on the table (postpone temporarily). 
                  Privileged motions (undebatable): 
                  i.  Question of privilege. 
                  j.  Recess. 
                  HIGHEST RANK: 
                  k.  Adjourn. 
                  (Ord. No. 1-94, § 2-04, 10-24-1994) 
                  Sec. 2-58. - Subsidiary motions. 
                  During the course of debate, councilmembers may introduce motions that propose that the city council take a particular action on a main motion. These motions are called subsidiary motions, and they allow the city council to reach a conclusion on the main motion. Subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. Three subsidiary motions, amend, limit debate, and vote immediately, also can apply to other subsidiary motions. 
                  (1)  Postpone indefinitely. If a councilmember believes that the main motion should not be considered by the council, that councilmember may move to postpone the consideration of the main motion indefinitely. If the motion is successful, consideration of the main motion stops and the main motion is tabled. A motion to postpone indefinitely can be debated but it cannot be amended. The concurrence of at least three councilmembers shall be required for the motion to pass. 
                  (2)  Amend. 
                  a.  If a councilmember believes that a main motion that is on the table should be changed in order to make it more acceptable, he can move to amend the motion. Amendments must be closely related to the original motion and must not change the nature of the motion they amend. Motions to refer, amend, postpone to a time certain, and the motion to recess can also be amended. A motion cannot be amended more than two times. 
                  b.  Debate is allowed on a motion to amend only if the original motion is debatable. If the amendment is adopted, the council shall consider the amended version of the motion. 
                  (3)  Refer to a committee (commit). If a councilmember believes that further information is needed before the council can act on a main motion, he may propose that the motion be referred to a specific committee or department for further study. If an appropriate committee does not already exist, a committee may be formed as a part of the motion. A motion to refer should specify the date the committee or department will report back to the council. This motion is debatable and amendable. 
                  (4)  Postpone to a time certain (postpone definitely). A motion to postpone to a certain time may be proposed if a councilmember believes that the main motion should not be considered until a future time. This motion shall set a particular time for the main motion to be considered again. It is debatable and can be amended. If this motion is passed, the mayor will bring the original motion back to the council for consideration at the specified time. 
                  (5)  Limit or extend limits of debate. A motion to limit debate places a time constraint on the length of debate. The details of such a motion are to be decided by the councilmember who makes the motion. This motion can also be used to extend the limits of debate if a limit on debate already exists. Debate is not allowed on this motion. 
                  (6)  Vote immediately (previous question). If a councilmember believes that the motion that is being considered should be voted on, the councilmember can move to vote immediately. The motion is undebatable. 
                  (7)  Lay on the table (postpone temporarily). A motion to lay on the table proposes that the consideration of a main motion be postponed until a later time in the meeting. The motion can be brought up for consideration only if a motion to resume consideration is accepted by the council during the same meeting. The motion will die if it is not taken up during the meeting. Debate is not allowed on this motion, and the motion is not amendable. 
                  (Ord. No. 1-94, § 2-05, 10-24-1994) 
                  Sec. 2-59. - Privileged motions. 
                  Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting. They do not address or relate to a main motion and can be introduced whether or not there is a main motion under consideration. Privileged motions take precedence over all subsidiary motions. Debate is not allowed on these motions. 
                  (1)  Question of privilege. A formal question addressed to the mayor concerning the rights of a councilmember or of the council as a whole is referred to as a question of privilege. It does not require a second and cannot be debated or amended. The mayor is required to make a ruling on the question. 
                  (2)  Recess. A motion to recess proposes that the meeting be suspended for a particular amount of time. The motion must specify the length of the recess. The motion must also be seconded. Debate is not allowed on this motion, but the motion can be amended. 
                  (3)  Adjourn. In order for a meeting to come to a close, a councilmember must make a motion to adjourn. The motion to adjourn has the highest rank of any motion, and as a result it can be introduced at any time. The motion requires a second, but is not debatable or amendable. 
                  (Ord. No. 1-94, § 2-06, 10-24-1994) 
                  Sec. 2-60. - Incidental motions. 
                  Incidental motions allow councilmembers to exert their rights as a member of the city council. Incidental motions can be introduced at any time during a meeting. 
                  (1)  Appeal. If a councilmember disagrees with a decision that is made by the mayor, that councilmember may appeal the decision. If the appeal is seconded, the appeal will be considered by the council. The mayor has the opportunity to explain the ruling that has been challenged. The council may then debate the appeal. The council shall decide if the mayor's decision is to be upheld or overturned. An appeal is high in precedence and can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or by a motion to lay on the table. 
                  (2)  Parliamentary inquiry. If a councilmember has a question about the rules of order, he may ask the mayor to give an opinion on that question. This question should take the form of a parliamentary inquiry and should relate to the current business of the council. This motion takes precedence over all motions except privileged motions. This motion does not require a second and is not debatable or amendable. 
                  (3)  Point of order (question of order). If a councilmember believes that a violation of the rules of parliamentary procedure has occurred, he can raise a point of order. A second is not required. The mayor can make a ruling on the question. However, if the council so chooses, it can debate the issue and overrule the holding of the mayor. A point of order can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or a motion to lay on the table. 
                  (4)  Point of information (request for information). If a councilmember has a question about the facts of a particular issue that is being considered, he may ask a point of information. This motion is addressed first to the mayor and then to the appropriate person. A second is not required, and the motion is not debatable or amendable. 
                  (Ord. No. 1-94, § 2-07, 10-24-1994) 
                  Sec. 2-61. - Supplementary main motions. 
                  Three motions allow the city council to act on a main motion that has either been passed or tabled by the council. These motions are considered to be main motions but differ from usual main motions in the ways specified. 
                  (1)  Reconsider. The motion to reconsider allows the council to debate whether or not to overturn a decision made at the meeting that is in progress. It allows the council to consider new information that may affect the decision that has already been made. Any councilmember can make a motion to reconsider, and any councilmember may second the motion. The motion is debatable, but it cannot be amended. If a motion to reconsider is passed, the original decision will be voided; and the council will return to debate and revote the original motion. 
                  (2)  Rescind. A motion to rescind proposes that the council overturn a motion passed at a previous meeting. A motion to rescind can be made by any councilmember. It is in order as long as the original motion has not been implemented. An announcement of the intention to rescind a motion may be made at the meeting where the decision was made, or the councilmember seeking to rescind may place the matter on the agenda for the next meeting. The motion to rescind will then be placed on the agenda for the next meeting. At the next meeting, the motion to rescind will formally be made. If it is seconded, the mayor and councilmember shall debate and vote on rescission. If a motion to rescind is passed, the original decision will be voided. 
                  (3)  Resume consideration. The motion to resume consideration allows the council to consider a motion that has been temporarily postponed. This motion requires a second and is not debatable or amendable. It is a main motion but ranks higher than any debatable motion.

                  (2)  Engage in or accept private employment or render services for private interests when such employment or service is incompatible with the proper discharge of his official duties or would tend to impair his independence of his judgment or action in the performance of his official duties.

Upon receipt of a complaint the city manager or city attorney shall randomly draw the names of three members from the board of ethics pool. The three members along with the city attorney as legal counsel, shall constitute an investigating committee to determine whether the complaint sets forth significant facts and circumstances so as to warrant a hearing before the board of ethics. The investigating committee shall have the right to request supporting documentation from the complaining party if the committee deems it reasonable to avoid the pursuit of frivolous complaints. If the complaint does not set forth sufficient facts to constitute an alleged violation and is found unjustified, frivolous or patently unfounded, it shall be dismissed and the complainant notified immediately.

                  The city attorney shall maintain a listing of these 18 qualified registered voters of the city. Should the investigating committee determine a complaint warrants a hearing before the board of ethics, the mayor and council, at the first public meeting after such determination, shall draw names randomly from the listing of qualified citizens until the specified seven members of the board of ethics have been appointed. Such board will elect one of its members to serve as chairman. 
                  The governing authority of the city shall provide a meeting space for the board of ethics. Subject to budgetary procedures and requirements of the city, the city shall provide the board of ethics with such supplies and equipment as may be reasonably necessary for it to perform its duties and responsibilities.

                  (3)  Prescribe forms, approved by the city attorney, for the disclosure required in this section and to make available to the public information disclosed as provided in this section.

                  (a)  In the event the investigating committee determines a complaint warrants a hearing, the board of ethics, as appointed in this division, shall cause the complaint to be served on the member of the governing authority charged as soon as practicable. Service may be by personal service or by certified mail, return receipt requested. A hearing shall be held within 60 days after filing of the complaint.

                  (b)  An action for judicial review may be commenced by filing an application for a writ of certiorari in the superior court of the county within 30 days after the decision of the mayor and council. The filing of such application shall act as supersedes.

                  (5)  Agricultural operations as defined in O.C.G.A. § 1-3-3, "definitions," to include raising, harvesting or storing of products of the field or orchard; feeding, breeding or managing livestock or poultry; producing or storing feed for use in the production of livestock, including but not limited to cattle, calves, swine, hogs, goats, sheep, and rabbits or for use in the production of poultry, including but not limited to chickens, hens and turkeys; producing plants, trees, fowl, or animals; the production of aqua culture, horticultural, dairy, livestock, poultry, eggs and apiarian products; farm buildings and farm ponds; 
                  (6)  Forestry land management practices, including harvesting; provided, however, that when such exempt forestry practices cause or result in land-disturbing or other activities otherwise prohibited in a buffer, as established in paragraphs (15) and (16) of subsection 34-44(c) of this article, no other land-disturbing activities, except for normal forest management practices, shall be allowed on the entire property upon which the forestry practices were conducted for a period of three years after completion of such forestry practices; 
                  (7)  Any project carried out under the technical supervision of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) of the United States Department of Agriculture; 
                  (8)  Any project involving less than one acre of disturbed area; provided, however, that this exemption shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity within a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre or within 200 feet of the bank of any state waters, and for purposes of this paragraph, "State Waters" excludes channels and drainage ways which have water in them only during and immediately after rainfall events and intermittent streams which do not have water in them year-round; provided, however, that any person responsible for a project which involves less than one acre, which involves land-disturbing activity, and which is within 200 feet of any such excluded channel or drainage way, must prevent sediment from moving beyond the boundaries of the property on which such project is located and provided, further, that nothing contained herein shall prevent the local issuing authority from regulating any such project which is not specifically exempted by paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (9) or (10) of this section; 
                  (9)  Construction or maintenance projects, or both, undertaken or financed in whole or in part, or both, by the department of transportation, the Georgia Highway Authority, or the state road and tollway authority; or any road construction or maintenance project, or both, undertaken by any county or municipality; provided, however, that construction or maintenance projects of the department of transportation or the state road and tollway authority which disturb one or more contiguous acres of land shall be subject to provisions of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7.1; except where the department of transportation, the Georgia Highway Authority, or the state road and tollway authority is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state general permit, in which case a copy of a notice of intent under the state general permit shall be submitted to the local issuing authority, the local issuing authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders; 
                  (10)  Any land-disturbing activities conducted by any electric membership corporation or municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the public service commission, any utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as defined in O.C.G.A. § 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United States engaged in the generation, transmission, or distribution of power; except where an electric membership corporation or municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the public service commission, any utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as defined in O.C.G.A. § 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United States engaged in the generation, transmission, or distribution of power is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state general permit, in which case the local issuing authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders; and

                  (Ord. No. 2011-14, § III, 4-28-2011) 
                  Sec. 34-34. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in [subsections] (c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  [Conservation and engineering practices.] The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regarding and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)  [Additional requirements.] Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  [Injury to property.] The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 2011-14, § IV, 4-28-2011) 
                  Sec. 34-35. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Fort Oglethorpe without first obtaining a permit from the building inspections department to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the building inspections department and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 34-34(b)and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land-disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 34-34(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6) [of this section], have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 34-34(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsections 34-34(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(6) [of this section] are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
                  (Ord. No. 2011-14, § V, 4-28-2011) 
                  Sec. 34-36. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The building official or his designee will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within twelve (12) months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)  The building inspections department shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  Sec. 34-37. - Penalties and incentives. 
                  (a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  (b)  Stop-work orders. 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and 
                  (3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  (4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop-work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop-work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of subsection 34-35(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any City Charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article under county ordinances approved under this article shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

                  ARTICLE IV. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREAS 

                  Sec. 34-101. - Purpose 
                  The purpose within the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that the city and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water. 
                  Groundwater resources are contained within underground reservoirs known as aquifers. These aquifers are zones of rock beneath the earth's surface capable of containing or producing water from a well. They occupy vast regions of the subsurface and are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge area. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized.

                  Drastic means the standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in U. S. Environmental Protection Agency Document EPA-600-2-87;035. (Note: the DRASTIC methodology is the most widely used technique for evaluating pollution susceptibility). 
                  Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of an aquifer of being polluted from spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge areas. 
                  Pollution susceptibility map means the relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the Department of Natural Resources, using the DRASTIC methodology. (Georgia Department of Natural Resources Hydrologic Atlas 20: Groundwater Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia). 
                  Recharge area means any portion of the earth's surface, where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer. 
                  Significant recharge areas means those areas mapped by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition).

                  ARTICLE V. - WETLANDS 

                  Sec. 34-151. - Purpose. 
                  The wetlands in the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provided habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well being of many communities within the state. 
                  Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
                  The purpose of this article is to promote wetlands protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process.

                  [The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:] 
                  Wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation. 
                  Generalized wetlands map means the current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands inventory maps for the city. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland means an area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland determination means a delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C./1344, as amended. 
                  Regulated activity means any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. excepting those activities exempted in section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act.

                  Sec. 34-201. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
                  (1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
                  (2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
                  (3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
                  (4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
                  (5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the county's greenspace protection plan; 
                  (6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and, 
                  (7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up.

                  (c)  Locations of fire hydrants. Approved fire hydrants shall be located every 300 feet. Fire hydrants may be located every 500 feet in those areas determined by the fire official to be predominately residential, one and two family dwellings only. Maximum distance from the nearest hydrant to the most remote exterior point of any building shall be 300 foot. The maximum distance may be increased to 500 feet for those one and two family dwellings determined by the fire official to be located in a predominately residential area. The distance shall be measured on a roadway surface meeting the fire department access requirements outlined in the SFPC, with distance being added for turns and obstacles that may increase the way hose may be laid. 
                  (d)  Maintenance. In addition to those requirements in the IFC, all hydrants found to be defective shall be repaired to proper working order within 36 hours of notification. If the hydrant is not repaired within the time specified the City of Fort Oglethorpe will repair the hydrant and all costs will be charged to the owner of said hydrant. The owner of said hydrant will be responsible for the maintenance and repair of hydrants, and will be charged for the repairs if done by the City of Fort Oglethorpe when a defective fire hydrant is found, when a fire hydrant is found to be out of service, and when a hydrant is fixed. Any fire hydrant not located within a public right-of-way or within an easement which has been deeded to the city shall be deemed private and will be the responsibility of the owner of the property where the fire hydrant is located. 
                  (e)  Obstruction. It shall be unlawful for any person to obstruct or hinder the approach of the Fire Department to any fire hydrants. In order to assure access to fire hydrants, the following requirements must be met:

                  Sec. 38-82. - Purposes, intent and scope. 
                  (a)  Purposes and intent. It is the primary purpose of this article to provide for the reasonable protection of life and property from the hazards created by fire, smoke, explosion or panic created from a fear of fire or smoke. It is the intent of this article to accomplish its purpose: 
                  (1)  Through educational efforts and programs designed to change high-risk attitudes and behaviors that are the root causes of most fire-related problems; 
                  (2)  Through consultations and informational programs, develop in people an awareness of the provisions of this article and other applicable laws, and aid them to determine the options available to correct hazards or problems noted; and 
                  (3)  By providing through this article reasonable, realistic and practical safeguards against fire and its related hazards. This article is declared to be remedial and shall be construed to secure beneficial interests and purposes, which are public safety, health and general welfare, through safety to life and property from fire, explosion and other hazards incident to the use and occupance of buildings, structures or premises. 
                  (b)  Scope. 
                  (1)  Applicability. The provisions of this article shall apply to all new and existing buildings, structures, premises, facilities and applicable conditions within the city; however, existing situations or conditions not in strict compliance with this article may be permitted to continue unless they are deemed by the fire marshal to constitute a distinct hazard to life or to property from fire, smoke or explosion. The provisions of this article shall not apply to the interior of one- or two-family dwellings or to the premises upon which such dwellings are located or to the interior of any apartment dwelling unit, provided such dwellings or apartments are used strictly for residential purposes. This article shall apply to such dwelling units whenever an activity coming under this article is conducted in such units and which creates a hazard from fire, smoke or explosion to life or to property. 
                  (2)  Federal and state authority. The provisions of this article shall not be held to deprive any federal or state agency or any applicable governing body having jurisdiction of any power or authority which it had on the effective date of the adoption of this article or of any remedy then existing for the enforcement of its orders, nor shall it deprive any individual or corporation of its legal rights as provided by law. 
                  (3)  Appendices. The appendices included in the codes adopted in section 38-81 are not intended for enforcement unless specifically referenced in the text of such codes. 
                  (4)  Referenced standards. Standards referenced in the codes adopted in section 38-81 shall be considered an integral part of such codes without separate adoption. If specific portions of a standard are denoted by code text, only those portions of the standard shall be enforced. Permissive and advisory provisions in a standard shall not be construed as mandatory. 
                  (5)  Existing buildings and special historic buildings. The provisions of this article shall apply to existing buildings or structures in the city; however, the provisions of such codes shall be coordinated by the fire marshal. The provisions of this article shall apply to special buildings or structures identified by the state or by the city as historic buildings; however, the provisions of this article shall be coordinated by the fire marshal with the applicable provisions of applicable state laws or regulations.

The purpose of such inspections is to ascertain if any condition exists which could be reasonably construed to cause a fire or explosion or that could contribute to the spread of a fire or its by-products, or to ascertain any significant nonconformance with the purposes, intent and other provisions of this article or of any other applicable law, rule or regulation affecting safety to life and/or property from fire, explosion or related hazards. The fire marshal is authorized to apply other applicable laws, and to cause to be corrected any condition which could be reasonably construed to cause a fire or explosion, or that could contribute to the spread of a fire, or any significant nonconformance with the purposes, intent or provisions of this article affecting safety to life and/or property from fire, explosion or related hazards.

                  Sec. 38-88. - Right of entry to conduct inspections.

Before entering any building, structure, facility or premises not normally open to the public, except when a fire or other emergency condition exists or has occurred, the fire marshal or his representative shall obtain the consent of the occupant, owner or person in charge at the time. Where consent to enter is refused, the fire marshal may seek an order or an administrative search warrant from the municipal court, or if deemed appropriate, from the superior court of Catoosa County authorizing his entry or that of his representatives for the purpose of conducting the inspection or investigation. The term "emergency condition," for purposes of this section, shall mean any condition or circumstance which the fire marshal or fire chief judges to constitute an immediate threat or danger to the occupants of the building, structure, facility or premises or to persons or property exposed to a fire, the hazards associated with fire, explosion, the threat of fire or explosion, or exposed to risks from some other hazardous condition or circumstance.

                  Sec. 38-89. - Implied consent. 
                  Any application for or the acceptance of any approval, permit, license or certificate requested, or required pursuant to this article or other applicable law or ordinance of this city or state, constitutes agreement and consent by the person making the application, or accepting the approval, permit, license or certificate to allow the fire marshal or his representatives to enter the building, structure, facility or premises at any reasonable time to conduct inspections as may be deemed appropriate by the fire marshal or as otherwise provided by this article or other applicable ordinances, rules, regulations or state law.

                  (a)  Whenever the fire marshal or his designated representative finds any violation of this article or any fire hazard, he is authorized to issue or serve a written notice of the findings of an inspection as set forth in this chapter and to notify the building official. 
                  (b)  Whenever the fire marshal or his designated representative finds any violation of this article or any fire hazard which is deemed to create a serious or significant potential threat to life in event of fire or explosion, he is authorized to issue a written order to correct or abate the violation or hazard. Such order when issued shall set forth a reasonable and realistic time frame or date limit for correction, abatement or compliance. The time frame for correction, abatement or compliance established by or as directed by the fire marshal, or his designated representative, may be reasonably correlated by him to the seriousness or relative degree of hazard, and/or to the complexity of the means of correction or abatement. 
                  (c)  Where deemed necessary, due to the potential of risk of life or property, the fire marshal may issue a verbal order for the immediate correction or abatement of a violation or fire hazard. This may be followed by a written order or notice of action.

                  (a)  Interference with fire officials. It shall be unlawful for any person to interfere with, abuse or obstruct in any way the fire chief, fire marshal or their representatives in carrying out any actions in accordance with their official duties as set forth by this article, or by any other applicable local ordinance, or by any law or regulation of the state. 
                  (b)  Unlawful use of credentials; unlawful impersonation of fire official. It shall be unlawful for any unauthorized person to use an official or unofficial badge or credential so as to impersonate an authorized fire official or to otherwise impersonate a fire official. 
                  (c)  Authority to investigate fires, explosions, false alarms or related incidents. The fire marshal or his authorized representatives are authorized to investigate the cause, origin and circumstances of any fire or explosion, or to investigate any incident resulting from the sending or sounding of a false alarm of fire or a bomb threat. When in the judgment of the fire marshal reasonable cause exists that a fire or explosion may have been of criminal origin, the fire marshal or his authorized representative is authorized to locate and take custody of any or all physical evidence relating to the cause of the fire or explosion and to continue the investigation to the extent deemed appropriate within the limits of fire prevention bureau resources and within the limits of applicable state laws. The fire marshal shall inform the police department of each fire of criminal or suspected criminal origin, false alarms or bomb threats. Also, he shall assist the police department in its investigations of reported incidents if so requested by that department. The police department shall be responsible for the investigation of fires and/or explosions of criminal or suspected criminal origin, false alarms or bomb threats so as to identify, apprehend and assist in the prosecution of the person responsible for such criminal act. 
                  (d)  Evacuation of buildings, structures, facilities or premises.

All persons under order to evacuate shall promptly leave the evacuation area and shall not reenter until authorized to do so by the official who issued the evacuation order. This section shall not pertain to bomb threats where no bomb or explosive device is known to exist. In such bomb threat situations, the decision to evacuate or not to evacuate is the responsibility of the person in charge of the building, structure, facility or premises at that time. 
                  (e)  Permits and approvals. No person shall maintain, store or handle materials, or conduct processes which produce conditions hazardous to life or property, or install equipment used in connection with such activities without first obtaining approval, or as appropriate based on the provisions of this article, a permit from the fire marshal. Where conditions or activities are also regulated by a state or federal agency and a permit, license or certificate is required by the regulating agency, no local permit is required; however, the approval of the fire marshal is required and he shall have the authority to apply the provisions of this article where a hazardous condition is discovered. 
                  (f)  Tests. All equipment required by this article or other applicable codes adopted by the city or by the state shall be maintained in a safe, sound and operational condition. The fire marshal may require tests or test reports as proof of compliance. Required tests are to be made at the expense of the owner or his agent by an approved testing laboratory or other approval agency or firm acceptable to the fire marshal. 
                  (g)  Authority to expose or stop work. Whenever any construction or installation coming under this article is subject to inspection prior to use and is covered or concealed without having first been inspected, the fire marshal may require by verbal and/or written order that such work be exposed for inspection. The fire marshal shall be notified when the installation is ready for inspection within a reasonable period of time. When any construction or installation work is being performed in violation of the plans, specifications or understandings as approved by the fire marshal, a written order may be issued to the responsible party to stop work on that portion of the work which is in violation. The order shall state the nature of the violation. No work shall be continued on that portion until the violation has been corrected. 
                  (h)  Administrative liability. Any officer or employee of the city empowered or authorized to administer or act under the provisions of this article or other applicable codes in force in the city or adopted or required by the state, and acting for the city or state in the discharge of his duties, shall not be held liable personally; and he is relieved from all personal liability from any damages that may accrue to any person or property as a result of any act required, implied or permitted, in the discharge of his duties, or as required, implied or permitted by this article or other applicable codes in force in the city or adopted or required by the state. 
                  (i)  Municipal liability. The city shall not be liable for any damage to persons or property resulting from any act or any failure to act in connection with any provision of this article or other applicable codes in force in the city or adopted or required by the state. 
                  (j)  Permitting and inspection. The inspection or permitting of any building or plan by any employee of the division of fire prevention of the fire department under the requirements of this article shall not be construed in any court as a warranty of the physical condition of such building or the adequacy of such plan. Neither the city or any employee of the city shall be liable in tort for damages for any defect or hazardous or illegal condition or inadequacy in such building or plan, nor for any failure or any component of such building, which may occur subsequent to such inspection or permitting.

                  (a)  Permit required. No person shall maintain, store or handle materials or conduct processes which produce conditions hazardous to life or property, or install equipment used in connection with such activities without first obtaining approval, or as appropriate, a fire regulatory permit from the fire marshal as provided; however, the approval of the fire marshal is required, and he shall have the authority to apply the provisions of this article where a hazardous condition is discovered.

Any person desiring to conduct or engage in any new process or activity requiring a fire regulatory permit under this article shall apply for a permit as set forth in this section and shall be issued the permit prior to engaging in the conducting of the process or activity, or before occupying a building or structure requiring a permit. 
                  (c)  Existing activities. Persons known to be conducting processes or activities required to be permitted under this article on or before the date of adoption of this article, shall be advised that a permit is required.

A permit shall not be a substitute for any license or certificate required by law. A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with work and shall not be construed as authority to violate, cancel, alter or set aside any of the provisions of this article.

                  (e)  Transfer of permit prohibited. A fire regulatory permit shall not be transferable, and any change in use or occupancy of a building or premises shall require a new permit.

                  (a)  Application for permit. An application for a permit shall be made to the fire marshal on a form available at the division of fire prevention. The form shall be fully completed. The application shall be accompanied by such data as may be required by the fire marshal and by the required fee, as set forth in subsection (c) of this section. 
                  (b)  Agreement to comply; responsibility. The filing of an application for a permit or a request for an approval from the fire marshal under this article constitutes an agreement on the part of the person the applicant represents to comply with the provisions of this article and of the technical codes and standards adopted by reference under this article or otherwise adopted by the city council. Such filing shall also constitute an understanding on the part of the permittee that the permittee, not the city, the fire marshal or the fire chief, shall bear the full responsibility for any damages to persons and/or property in connection with any fire, explosion or other accident or event involving any process, material, installation or activity covered by a permit or approval issued in connection with any of the provisions of this article. 
                  (c)  Processing fee. There shall be a processing fee as stated in the schedule of fees and charges for the issuance of a fire regulatory permit. The fee shall accompany the permit application when it is filed. If an inspection conducted to determine compliance with this article reveals that a condition exists which would preclude the issuance of a permit, the processing fee shall not be refunded. Further, where a permit is denied due to violations and hazards noted, the activity for which the permit is required shall not be deemed in compliance. The fire marshal may require the filing of a new application and fee if he deems the original application and fee to have been filed prematurely or filed with false or incomplete information. Such fee shall not be required of government, charitable or religious organizations. 
                  (d)  Review of applications; issuance. The fire marshal or his authorized representative shall review applications submitted and issue approvals or permits as required provided the data on the application and plans and specifications submitted with the application indicate to a reasonable degree compliance with the provisions of this article and the technical codes and standards adopted by reference under this article or otherwise adopted by the city council. Permits for activities requiring evidence of financial responsibility on the part of the permittee as required by this article shall not be issued unless proof of required financial responsibility is furnished.

                  (f)  Display of permits. A copy of the fire regulatory permit shall be posted or shall otherwise be readily accessible at each place a permitted activity is performed. As required by the fire marshal, a permit holder may be required to carry the permit. 
                  (g)  Records. A record of fire regulatory permits issued and any exceptions granted shall be maintained in the fire prevention bureau. Such record shall be available for public inspection during normal business hours upon request to the fire marshal. 
                  (h)  Duration of permits; limitations on issuance. A fire regulatory permit issued under this article shall continue until revoked or for the period of time designated in the permit at the time of issuance of the permit. The permit shall be issued to one person only and for the location or purpose described in the permit. Any change which affects any of the conditions of the permit shall require a new permit. The fire marshal may grant an extension of the permit period where an expiration date has been established upon presentation by the permittee of a satisfactory reason for failure to start or complete the work or activity authorized by the permit by the designated expiration date. A permit issued shall become invalid unless the use authorized by such is commenced within six months after issuance, or if the use authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of six months after the time the use of the permit is commenced. One or more extensions of time, for periods not to exceed 90 days each, may be allowed for the permit provided the extension is requested in writing and justifiable cause is demonstrated. Extensions granted by the fire marshal shall be in writing. 
                  (i)  Temporary permit. When a potentially hazardous situation or activity of a temporary nature is encountered, and is not specifically regulated by this article, a permit may be required by and issued by the fire marshal to cover the duration of the situation or activity. He shall require the filing of an application and fee as set forth for a regular fire regulatory permit. 
                  (j)  Consolidated permit. Only one permit shall be required for each location of a firm which may be required to obtain more than one permit under the permit requirements of this article. Such consolidated permit shall list all of the materials or activities covered by the permit. Revocation of any of the permitted materials or activities covered by the consolidated permit shall require the revocation of the permit and issuance of a new permit. In such situation, a new and revised permit may be issued by the fire marshal for the materials or activities not covered by the revocation. No new application is required and no fee is required for the revised consolidated permit. 
                  (k)  Revocation of permits. The fire marshal may revoke his approval of a permit issued under the provisions of this article when it is determined there has been any false statements or misrepresentation as to the material facts in the application or in the plans on which the approval or permit was based. Further, the fire marshal may revoke his approval or a permit upon determination by him that the occupancy, operation or activity for which the approval or permit or was issued is in violation of or is not in conformity with the provisions of this article or with other applicable codes adopted by the city or with applicable laws, rules or regulations of the state jurisdiction; and the fire marshal may notify the responsible agency of any noted violation, nonconformance or condition deemed to be hazardous.

                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 42-1. - Authorization. 
                  Article IX, section II of the state constitution and O.C.G.A., section 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city does ordain as follows. 
                  (Ord. No. 2008-02, art. 1, § A, 2-25-2008) 
                  Sec. 42-2. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood and relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. No. 2008-02, art. 1, § B, 2-25-2008) 
                  Sec. 42-3. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  (Ord. No. 2008-02, art. 1, § C, 2-25-2008) 
                  Sec. 42-4. - Objectives. 
                  The objectives of this chapter are: 
                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  Existing construction is any structure for which the "start of construction" commenced before April 27, 1988 (i.e. the effective date of the first floodplain management code or ordinance adopted by the community as a basis for that community's participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)). 
                  Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before April 27, 1988 (i.e. the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community). 
                  Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads. 
                  Flood or flooding means a general temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
                  (1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or

                  Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, issued by the federal insurance administration, delineating the areas of special flood hazard and/or risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
                  Flood insurance study the official report by the federal insurance administration evaluating flood hazards and containing flood profiles and water surface elevations of the base flood. 
                  Floodplain means any land area susceptible to flooding. 
                  Floodproofing means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is: 
                  (1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

                  b.  Directly by the secretary of the interior in states without approved programs. 
                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this code. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of this chapter, the term is synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD). 
                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means any structure for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after April 27, 1988 and includes any subsequent improvements to the structure (i.e., the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the community as a basis for community participation in the (NFIP)). 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after April 27, 1988 (i.e., the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community). 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) as corrected in 1988 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain.

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwellings units or part of the main structure (note: accessory structures are not exempt from any chapter requirements). For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. 
                  The market value of the structure should be: 
                  (1)  The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or 
                  (2)  In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. 
                  The term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage" regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include: 
                  (1)  Those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specification which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project; or 
                  (2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the street, utilities and pads equals or exceed 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  ARTICLE III. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 42-61. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure. 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
                  (3)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this chapter, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, us of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters. 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this chapter, shall be undertaken only if the non-conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  Sec. 42-62. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization standards of section 42-61(4), "Elevated buildings." 
                  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Non-residential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevations, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 42-43(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: 
                  1.  Individual lots or parcels; 
                  2.  In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions; 
                  3.  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or 
                  4.  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, 
                  Must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement (ref. section 42-61(6) above). 
                  d.  All recreation vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is license, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and as no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections (a)—(c), above. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 42-7, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; 
                  b.  Only if subsection (4)a above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of article III.

                  Sec. 42-63. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 42-7, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A zones), or where base flood date have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 42-7, then the city building official shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source in order to administer the provisions of article III. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2) and (3) shall apply. 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site (Note: require the lowest floor to be elevated on foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 42-61(4), elevated buildings. 
                  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  The city building official shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.

                  Areas of special flood hazard established in section 42-7 may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and non residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 42-61(4), "Elevated buildings." 
                  The city building official shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file; 
                  (2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in section 42-42(1)c and 42-42(2); 
                  (3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.

                  Sec. 42-81. - Appeals and variances. 
                  (a)  The city appeals board as established by the city shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the city building official in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city appeals board may appeal such decision to the county superior court, as provided in O.C.G.A., section 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such request, the city appeals board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variances the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between he base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The city building official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the city appeals board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

                  (1)  Application for designation of historic districts or property. Designations may be proposed by the city council, the commission, or: 
                  a.  For historic districts, an historical society, neighborhood association or group of property owners may apply to the commission for designation; 
                  b.  For historic properties, an historical society, neighborhood association or property owner may apply to the commission for designation.

                  c.  Require that a certificate of appropriateness be obtained from the commission prior to any material change in appearance of the designated property; and 
                  d.  Require that the property or district be shown on the city's official zoning map, or other designated map in the absence of such a map and kept as a public record, to provide notice of such designation. 
                  (3)  Required public hearings. The commission and the city council shall hold a public hearing on any proposed ordinance for the designation of any historic district or property. Notice of the hearing shall be published in at least three consecutive issues in the principal newspaper of local circulation, and written notice of the hearing shall be mailed by the commission to all owners and occupants of such properties. All such notices shall be published or mailed not less than ten nor more than 20 days prior to the date set for the public hearing. A notice sent via the United States mail to the last known owner of the property shown on the city tax roll and a notice sent via United States mail to the address of the property to the attention of the occupant shall constitute legal notification to the owner and occupant under this chapter. 
                  (4)  Recommendations on proposed designations. A recommendation to affirm, modify or withdraw the proposed ordinance for designation shall be made by the commission within 15 days following the public hearing and shall be in the form of a resolution to the city council. 
                  (5)  City council's action on commission recommendations. Following receipt of the commission's recommendation, the city council may adopt the ordinance as proposed, may adopt the ordinance with any amendments it deems necessary, or reject the ordinance. The city council shall take action on the commission's recommendations within 60 days. 
                  (6)  Notification of historic preservation section. No less than 30 days prior to making a recommendation on any ordinance designating a property or district as historic, the commission must submit the report required in subsection (a)(3) to the historic preservation section of the department of natural resources. 
                  (7)  Notification of adoption of ordinance for designation. Within 30 days following the adoption of the ordinance for designation by the city council, the owners and occupants of each designated historic property, and the owners and occupants of each structure, site or work of art located within a designated historic district, shall be given written notification of such designation by the city council, which notice shall apprise the owners and occupants of the necessity of obtaining a certificate of appropriateness prior to undertaking any material change in appearance of the historic property designated or within the historic district designated. A notice sent via the United States mail to the last known owner of the property shown on the city tax roll and a notice sent via United States mail to the address of the property to the attention of the occupant shall constitute legal notification to the owner and occupant under this chapter. 
                  (8)  Notification of other agencies regarding designation. The commission shall notify the city planning commission of the ordinance for designation, including the local historical organization. 
                  (9)  Moratorium on applications for alteration or demolition while ordinance for designation is pending. If an ordinance for designation is being considered, the commission shall have the power to freeze the status of the involved property.

                  (Code 1986, § 8-8-4) 
                  Sec. 50-5. - Application to historic preservation commission for certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (a)  Approval of alterations or new construction in historic districts or involving historic properties. After the designation by chapter of an historic property or of an historic district, no material change in the appearance of such historic property or of a structure, site, object or work of art within such historic district, shall be made or be permitted to be made by the owner or occupant unless the application for a certificate of appropriateness has been submitted to and approved by the historic preservation commission. 
                  (b)  Approval of new construction within designated districts. The commission shall issue certificates of appropriateness to new structures constructed within designated historic districts if these structures conform in design, scale, building materials, setback and landscaping to the character of the district specified in the design criteria developed by the commission. All new construction must also comply with other applicable city chapters, including building and zoning codes. 
                  (c)  Guidelines and criteria for certificates of appropriateness. When considering applications for certificates of appropriateness to existing buildings, the secretary of the interior's Standards for Historic Preservation Projects, including the secretary's Standards for Rehabilitation, shall be used as a guideline along with any other criteria adopted by the commission. 
                  (d)  Submission of plans to commission. An application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be accompanied by such drawings, photographs, plans or other documentation as may be required by the commission. Applications involving demolition or relocation shall be accompanied by post-demolition or relocation plans for the site. 
                  (e)  Acceptable commission reaction to applications for certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (1)  The commission shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material changes in the appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the aesthetic, historic or architectural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district. In making this determination, the commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the historical and architectural value and significance, architectural style, general design arrangement, texture and material of the architectural features involved, and their relationship to the exterior architectural style, and pertinent features of the other structures in the immediate neighborhood. 
                  (2)  The commission shall deny a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material changes in appearance would have substantial adverse effects on the aesthetic, historic or architectural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district. 
                  (f)  Public hearings on applications for certificates of appropriateness, notices and right to be heard. At least seven days prior to review of a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall take such action as may reasonably be required to inform the owners of any property likely to be affected by reasons of the application, and shall give the applicant and such owners an opportunity to be heard. In cases where the commission deems it necessary, it may hold a public hearing concerning the application. 
                  (g)  Interior alterations. In its review of applications for certificates of appropriateness, the commission shall not consider interior arrangement or use having no effect on exterior architectural features. 
                  (h)  Technical advice. The commission shall have the power to seek technical advice from outside its members on any application. 
                  (i)  Deadline for approval or rejection of application for certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (1)  The commission shall approve or reject an application for a certificate of appropriateness within 30 days after its filing by the owner or occupant of an historic property, or of a structure, site, object or work of art located within an historic district. Evidence of approval shall be by a certificate of appropriateness issued by the commission. Notice of the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness shall be sent by United States mail to the applicant and all other persons who have requested such notice in writing filed with the commission. 
                  (2)  Should the commission fail to act within 30 days, the applicant may file an appeal with the city council. The city council shall approve or reject the application within 30 days of the filing. 
                  (j)  Necessary actions to be taken by commission upon rejection of application for certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (1)  If the commission rejects an application, it shall state its reasons for doing so and shall transmit a record of such actions and reasons, in writing, to the applicant. The commission may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves of the application submitted. The applicant, if he so desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so. 
                  (2)  In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of the application for a certificate of appropriateness by the commission shall be binding upon the building inspector or other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits; and, in such a case, no building permit shall be issued. 
                  (k)  Undue hardship. Where by reason of unusual circumstances the strict application of any provision of this chapter would result in the exceptional practical difficulty or undue hardship upon any owner of a specific property, the commission shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to such provisions. Concerning variances, the commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgment, best fulfill the purpose of this chapter. A written record stating the reason for each variance shall be maintained by the commission with final approval from the city council. 
                  (l)  Requirement of conformance with certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (1)  All work performed pursuant to an issued certificate of appropriateness shall conform to the requirements of such certificate. If work is performed not in accordance with such certificate, the commission shall recommend that the city council issue a cease and desist order; and all work shall cease. 
                  (2)  The city council shall be authorized to institute any appropriate action or proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent any material change in appearance of a designated historic property or historic district, except those changes made in compliance with the provision of this chapter or to prevent any illegal act or conduct with respect to such historic property or historic district. 
                  (m)  Certificate of appropriateness void if construction not commenced. A certificate of appropriateness shall become void unless construction is commenced within six months of date of issuance. Certificates of appropriateness shall be issued for a period of 18 months and may be renewable. 
                  (n)  Recording of applications for certificate of appropriateness. The commission shall keep a public record of all applications for certificates of appropriateness, and of all the commission's proceedings in connection with the application. 
                  (o)  Acquisition of property. The commission may, where such action is authorized by the city council and is reasonably necessary or appropriate for the preservation of a unique historic property, enter into negotiations with the owner for the acquisition by gift, purchase, exchange or otherwise, to the property or any interest in the property. All such property shall be deeded to the city. 
                  (p)  Appeals. 
                  (1)  Any person adversely affected by any determination made by the commission relative to the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness may appeal such determination to the board of appeals. Any such appeal must be filed with the board of appeals within 15 days after the issuance of the determination or, in the case of a failure of the commission to act, within ten days of the expiration of the 30-day period allowed for commission action. 
                  (2)  The board of appeals, upon hearing the appeal, may approve, modify or reject any determination made by the commission. Appeals from decisions of the board of appeals may be taken to the city council; and, upon hearing the appeal, the council may approve, modify or reject any determination made by the board of appeals.

                  Sec. 50-6. - Demolition or relocation of an historic property within an historic district. 
                  (a)  Applications for certificates of appropriateness for demolition or relocation. The historic preservation commission shall have the authority to deny certificates of appropriateness for demolition or relocation.

                  (d)  Demolition/relocation criteria. Upon receipt of an application for a certificate of appropriateness for demolition or relocation, the commission shall use the criteria described in section 50-5 to determine whether to deny the application or issue a certificate of appropriateness for demolition or relocation. 
                  (Code 1986, § 8-8-6) 
                  Sec. 50-7. - Maintenance of historic properties and building and zoning code. 
                  (a)  Ordinary maintenance or repair. Ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural or environmental feature in or on an historic property to correct deterioration, decay or damage, or to sustain the existing form, and that does not involve a material change in design, material or outer appearance, does not require a certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (b)  Failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair. Property owners of historic properties or properties within historic districts shall not allow their buildings to deteriorate by failing to provide ordinary maintenance or repair. The historic preservation commission shall be charged with the following responsibilities regarding deterioration by neglect: 
                  (1)  The commission shall monitor the condition of historic properties and existing buildings in historic districts to determine if they are being allowed to deteriorate by neglect. Such conditions as broken windows, doors and openings which allow the elements and vermin to enter, the deterioration of exterior architectural features, or the deterioration of a building's structural system shall constitute failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair. 
                  (2)  If the commission determines a failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair, the commission will notify the owner of the property and set forth the steps which need to be taken to remedy the situation. The owner of such property will have 30 days in which to respond to the commission. 
                  (3)  If the condition is not remedied in 90 days after the initial 30 days as provided in this section, the owner shall be penalized as provided in section 50-9; and, at the direction of the city council, the commission may perform such maintenance or repair as is necessary to prevent deterioration by neglect. The owner of the property shall be liable for the cost of such maintenance and repair performed by the commission. 
                  (c)  Affirmation of existing building and zoning codes. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as to exempt property owners from complying with existing city or county building and zoning codes, nor to prevent any property owner from making any use of his property not prohibited by other statutes, ordinances or regulations. 
                  (Code 1986, § 8-8-7)

                  (a)  The properties listed in this section are designated collectively as an historic district of the city. Such designation requires that such properties be shown on the city's official zoning map, or other designated map in the absence of such a map and kept as public record, to provide notice of such designation. It further requires that a certificate of appropriateness be obtained from the historic preservation commission prior to any material change in appearance of the designated property.

The preliminary plat shall be prepared by a registered state land surveyor. After approval of such preliminary plat, the subdivider may proceed with construction and the preparation of the final plat and other documents required in connection therewith as specified in division 2 of this article and section 78-43. 
                  (c)  No plat of a subdivision of land within the area of planning jurisdiction of the city shall be filed or recorded by the clerk of court without the prior approval of the planning commission as specified in this section.

                  (a)  If the code enforcement officer finds that any provision of these regulations has been or is being violated, the code enforcement officer shall notify in writing the person responsible for such violation, indicating the nature of the violation and ordering the action necessary to correct it. The failure to give such notice shall not prevent the code enforcement officer from enforcing this chapter as provided in this article. 
                  (b)  The code enforcement officer shall have the right to enter upon any premises at any reasonable time for the purpose of making inspections on the premises necessary to carry out his duties in the enforcement of this chapter.

                  (b)  Submission of plans. Plans for all such developments shall be submitted to be approved by the planning commission whether or not such plat is to be recorded. No building permits shall be issued until such approval has been given.

                  Sec. 78-41. - General procedures. 
                  The procedure for review and approval of the subdivision plat consists of two separate steps.

This final plat becomes the instrument to be recorded in the office of the clerk of the county superior court, when duly signed by the chairman of the planning commission. All final plats approved by the planning commission must be stamped and in recordable form under the laws of the state. A planning commission staff member shall be authorized to approve or disapprove a final plat with the concurrence of the chairman of the planning commission for plats which are developed solely from an existing road. And which contains ten lots or less, and in which all of the requirements of this section are met.

                  Sec. 78-66. - Conformity to comprehensive plan. 
                  (a)  All proposed subdivisions shall conform to the city comprehensive plan, or regional plans and local zoning regulations. 
                  (b)  The population densities established by the comprehensive plan shall be observed by the subdivider and developer. 
                  (c)  All thoroughfares in the thoroughfare plan shown crossing or bordering a proposed subdivision are required to be provided for in the location and at the right-of-way width designated on the thoroughfare plan. 
                  (d)  To ensure development of the community in substantial conformity with the general principles set forth in the official plans and map of the city, the planning commission may require that the subdivider reserve open spaces for parks, schools, fire stations, playgrounds and any other use essential to the welfare of the city. Where there is no area officially designated in the official plans and maps, the location of the open space shall be mutually agreed upon by the planning commission and the subdivider. However, no more than ten percent of the total subdivision may be required by donation. If additional area over ten percent of a proposed subdivision is necessary to fulfill the requirements of the city, the additional area shall be offered for sale to the city at its fair market value. Such offer shall extend for a period of 90 days from the date of receipt by the city of such written offer. 
                  (e)  Clearly noted on the preliminary plat should be all the improvements the owner proposes to make pursuant to the development of the subdivision. These improvements shall relate to drainage, utilities and other improvements clearly noted on the preliminary plat and should be all the improvements the owner proposes to request the city or utility companies to make, relative to off-premises improvements necessary to the development of the subdivision. 
                  (f)  These improvements shall relate to drainage improvements necessary to carry runoff to a major drainage channel, and also all extensions of water mains, sewers and other utility extensions.

                  Sec. 78-67. - Street plan. 
                  (a)  Generally. The arrangement, character, extent, location and grade of all streets shall be laid out according to good land planning principles and shall be integrated with all existing and planned streets. New streets shall consider topographical conditions, orientation to vistas, public convenience and safety, and the proposed uses of land to be served by them. The proposed street system shall also be coordinated with the street system of the surrounding area. However, the number of streets converging upon any one point which would tend to promote congestion shall be held to a minimum. Creation of street intersections of three or more streets shall not be permitted. The street pattern shall be in conformity with a plan for the most advantageous development of the entire neighboring area. Sufficient proposed streets shall be provided to create normal circulation of traffic within the vicinity. Land abutting a proposed subdivision shall not be left landlocked by such proposed subdivision. Street design shall provide connections to abutting properties at intervals not to exceed the maximum block length of 1,800 feet. In addition, if in the opinion of the planning commission it is desirable to provide street access to an adjoining property, such street shall extend by dedication to the boundary of such property. A temporary turnaround, as defined in design standards for a street cul-de-sac, shall be provided for these streets. Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic in the subdivision will be discouraged. Subdivisions which abut or have included within the proposed area to be subdivided any freeway or major street, as shown on the city thoroughfare plan, shall be platted in the general location and of the width called for by such plan. In addition, it shall also provide the following: 
                  (1)  A marginal access street; 
                  (2)  Reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear property lines; 
                  (3)  Deep lots with rear service drives; or 
                  (4)  Other treatment which may be necessary to provide for the adequate protection of properties, and to afford separation of through and local traffic. 
                  Intersections of minor subdivision streets with major streets shall be held to a minimum. 
                  (b)  Half streets. Where there exists a dedicated or platted half street adjacent to the tract to be subdivided, the other half shall be platted. New half streets or half alleys shall be prohibited. 
                  (c)  Culs-de-sac. Streets designed to have one end permanently closed shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having a minimum right-of-way diameter of 100 feet, and a minimum roadway diameter of 80 feet. Where the cul-de-sac is expected to be continued in the future into unsubdivided land, the turnaround may be a temporary one. 
                  (d)  Street intersections. Street intersections with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall not be permitted. 
                  (e)  Minimum street right-of-way widths. In developed or vacant areas, the planning commission shall have the discretion of identifying or classifying streets. The widths or rights-of-way for the various streets (major streets, collector streets, minor streets and alleys) are indicated below. Widths shall be not less than as follows: 

                   
                  In cases where topography or other physical conditions make a street of the required minimum width impracticable, the planning commission may modify the above requirements. Through proposed neighborhood or local business areas, the road widths shall be increased ten feet of each side to provide for movement of vehicles into and out of necessary off-street parking areas without interferences to traffic. 
                  Additional width on existing roads: Subdivisions that adjoin existing roads shall dedicate additional right-of-way to meet the above minimum road width requirements: 
                  (1)  The entire right-of-way shall be provided where any part of the subdivision is on both sides of the existing road. 
                  (2)  When the subdivision is located on only one side of an existing road, one-half of the required right-of-way, measured from the centerline of the existing roadway, shall be provided. 
                  (f)  Minimum roadway widths. The minimum pavement widths for the various classifications of streets shall be as follows: 
                  (1)  Major street: Pavement width (measured from pavement edge to pavement edge without curb and gutter) as required by the state department of transportation or code enforcement officer. Pavement width (measured from pavement edge to pavement edge with curb and gutter) as required by the state department of transportation or code enforcement officer. 
                  (2)  Collector street: Without curb and gutter: 28 feet; with curb and gutter: 26 feet. 
                  (3)  Minor street and cul-de-sac: Without curb and gutter: 27 feet; with curb and gutter: 25 feet. 
                  (4)  Alleys: Without curb and gutter: 20 feet; with curb and gutter: 18 feet. 
                  (g)  Street grades. Street grades shall not exceed the following unless otherwise recommended and approved by the commissioner: 
                  (1)  Major street: Grade as required by the state department of transportation or the code enforcement officer. 
                  (2)  Collector street: Grade not to exceed 18 percent greater than 300 feet and ten percent for the remainder. 
                  (3)  Minor street and cul-de-sac: Grade not to exceed 18 percent greater than 300 feet and ten percent for the remainder. 
                  Grades approaching intersections shall not exceed five percent for a distance of not less than 100 feet from the centerline of such intersection. Minimum grades of all roadways shall not be less than five percent. Surface cross drainage shall not be permitted on any street. Vertical curves shall be constructed so as to afford a minimum sight distance being measured from the driver's eyes (4½ feet above the pavement surface) to an object four inches high on the pavement surface. 
                  (h)  Alignment and visibility. 
                  (1)  Horizontal curvature. The minimum radii of centerline curvature shall be as follows: 
                  a.  Major streets, as required by the state department of transportation or the city building code enforcement officer. 
                  b.  Collector streets, 150 feet. 
                  c.  Minor streets and dead-end streets and alleys, 75 feet. 
                  (2)  Tangents. 
                  a.  Major streets, as required by the state department of transportation or the city building code enforcement officer. 
                  b.  Collector streets, 50 feet. 
                  (3)  Vertical alignment. 
                  a.  Major streets shall have a sight distance of at least 300 feet at six feet above the ground level. 
                  b.  Collector streets shall have a sight distance of at least 150 feet at six feet above the ground level. 
                  (4)  Intersections. Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as possible. No street intersections shall be an angle of less than 60 degrees. Submission of a grading plan showing existing conditions and a detailed design for intersections which are unusual or located on difficult terrain may be required by the planning commission. 
                  (5)  Sight lines. Minor and collector streets shall have a clear sight triangle of 75 feet; 150 feet for major streets from the point of intersection; this shall be indicated on all plans. No buildings or other obstructions between three feet and 15 feet in height shall be permitted in this area. 
                  (6)  Curbline radius. The curbline radius at street intersections shall be at least 15 feet. Where the angle of street intersection is less than 90 degrees, a longer radius may be required. 
                  (i)  Alleys. Alleys may be required in commercial and industrial districts, except that the planning commission may waive this requirement where other definite and ensured provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading, unloading and parking facilities consistent with zoning requirements. Alleys are not permitted in residential districts, except when the planning commission determines special conditions warrant a secondary means of access. 
                  (j)  Names. No street name shall be used which will duplicate by spelling or sound or otherwise be confused with the name of existing streets. Street names are subject to the approval of the planning commission. Subdivision names and apartment project names shall not duplicate or be confused with existing names and are subject to approval by the planning commission. 
                  (k)  DOT approval. State department of transportation certificates of approval must be included for the proposed project if the project abuts any state, federal or city property.

                  Sec. 78-68. - Blocks. 
                  The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to: 
                  (1)  Provisions of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated; 
                  (2)  Needs for convenient access, circulation control and safety of street traffic; and 
                  (3)  Limitations and opportunities of topography. 
                  Where the proposed subdivision is adjacent to or contains a major street, the long dimensions of the blocks shall be parallel, or approximately parallel, to the major streets. Block lengths shall not be less than 400 nor more than 1,800 feet and shall normally be wide enough to allow two tiers of lots of appropriate depth. Pedestrian crosswalks not less than ten feet wide may be required where deemed essential in blocks over 800 feet long by the planning commission to provide circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, bus stops and other community facilities.

                  Sec. 78-69. - Lots. 
                  All lots which shall hereafter be established in connection with the development of a subdivision shall comply with the following design standards: 
                  (1)  Building lines. Residential building setback lines shall be at least 35 feet from the front property line. Residential lots shall not be platted to front directly on the right-of-way of a state or federal highway unless such right-of-way contains a marginal access street. 
                  (2)  Sidelines. Residential building setback lines shall be at least 15 feet from the side property line, and rear setback lines shall be at least 15 feet from the rear property line. 
                  (3)  City limits and lot lines. Lots shall not be divided by corporate boundary lines. 
                  (4)  Corner lots. Corner lots shall be sufficiently large to permit the location of buildings so as to conform with the building lines on both streets. 
                  (5)  Double frontage. Double frontage lots (i.e., lots having street frontage both in front and rear) shall not be permitted. 
                  (6)  Lot lines. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines and radial to curved street lines. 
                  (7)  Minimum lot dimensions and area. The minimum lot width at the front building line and minimum lot area shall be as shown in the following schedule: 

                   
                  * Note: Slight variations in these requirements, where public water and sewerage are provided, shall be considered by the planning commission in unusual circumstances. 
                  (8)  Flag lots must meet the R1 zoning minimum standards. Every lot must have a minimum of a 25-foot easement to a public road for ingress and egress. In no case shall there be more than three flags on one easement. 
                  (Ord. No. 95-21, § 8.00, 11-13-1995; Ord. No. 2004-13, 9-13-2004)

                  Sec. 78-73. - Drainage and inundation. 
                  (a)  A drainage plan shall be made for each subdivision by the owner's engineer or certified surveyor, which plan shall take into consideration the ultimate or saturated development of the tributary area in which the proposed subdivision is located. Adequate provisions shall be made to provide drainage easements needed within the subdivision, taking into consideration the saturated development of the tributary area. 
                  (b)  The storm and sanitary sewer plans shall be worked out prior to the development of the other utility plans. Engineering considerations shall give preferential treatment to these gravity flow improvements, as opposed to other utilities and improvements. Off-premises drainage easements and improvements may be required to handle the runoff of subdivisions into a natural drainage channel. But under no condition shall storm drainage be emptied into the sanitary sewer system, or vice versa. 
                  (c)  Low areas subject to periodic inundation shall not be developed or subdivided unless and until the planning commission establishes that: 
                  (1)  The nature of the land use (i.e., recreational areas) would not lend itself to damage by water inundation to an appreciable extent; 
                  (2)  The area may be filled or improved in such a manner to prevent such periodic inundation; or 
                  (3)  Minimum floor elevations are required to prevent damage to buildings and structures. 
                  (d)  The planning commission may require whatever additional engineering information it deems necessary to make a decision on subdivisions and other development which contains an area of questionable drainage. Lakes, ponds and similar areas will be accepted for maintenance only if sufficient land is dedicated as a public recreation area, or if such area constitutes a necessary part of the drainage control system. Such park land will be subject to approval by the governing body.

                  The governing body shall participate in the cost of oversize improvements within a subdivision, if in its judgment such oversized improvements are necessary to serve large areas of land not in the subdivision, and if the cost of such oversize improvements is an unreasonable burden on the subdivider.

                  Sec. 78-106. - Surety for completion of improvements. 
                  (a)  Provision of surety. The subdivider shall be responsible for the provision of all required improvements to the subdivision. This may be accomplished by either the full installation of all required improvements by the subdivider at the time that the final plat is to be submitted to the planning commission, or by the provision of surety for the completion of such improvements as shown on the final plat submitted for final approval. 
                  (b)  Requirements of surety. To ensure the construction and installation of required improvements, the subdivider shall deliver to the manager of the city, a certified check, surety bond or irrevocable letter of credit, or other acceptable security in such aggregate amount as is estimated by the code enforcement officer to be the total cost of the construction and installation of all public improvements which are the responsibility of the subdivider. 
                  (1)  Conditions. Bonds or an irrevocable letter of credit or other surety posted shall run to the city and provide that the subdivider, his heirs or successors and assigns, and their agents and servants, will comply with all applicable terms, conditions, provisions and requirements of this chapter and any other applicable requirements; will faithfully perform and complete the work of constructing and installing such facilities or improvements in accordance with this chapter and any other applicable requirements; and that the subdivider shall be responsible to the city for any unnecessary expense incurred through the failure of the subdivider, his heirs, successors and assigns, or their agents or servants, to complete the work of such construction in an acceptable manner, and from any damages growing out of negligence in performing or failing to perform such construction and installation. Before acceptance, any surety shall be approved by the city. If a bond is offered, it shall be executed by a surety or guaranty company qualified to transact business in the state. 
                  (2)  Duration and release. Bonds and/or other surety or cancellation of any bond shall be posted pursuant to this chapter. Acceptances shall be in writing accurately identifying the improvements covered. Facilities shall not be accepted unless they conform to the applicable city specifications and requirements. 
                  (3)  Default. If the construction or installation of any improvements or facilities for which a bond or other surety is posted is not completed within 90 days after substantial completion of any buildings or structures which such improvements or facilities are designed to serve, or within one year after the date of recording of the final plat, whichever is sooner, or if such construction or installation is not in accordance with applicable standards, the city may proceed to construct, install or modify such improvements or facilities in accordance with the applicable specifications and requirements, using the proceeds from such surety deposits to pay for such work. Such work may be done under contract or by city personnel. To the extent that any portion of a cash deposit is not required or used, such excess cash shall be repaid to the person making the deposit. 
                  (4)  Certification of receipt of surety for required improvements. The following form shall be printed directly on the final plat as follows, where a preliminary plat is not used: 
                  "I hereby certify that a security bond or letter of irrevocable credit or certified check in the amount of _____ has been received to ensure completion of all required improvements in the subdivision plat attached hereto in the event of default by the developer."

                  (1)  Such street improvements shall have been completed and in place for a period of one year and shall, upon inspection, following such period of time, be found to be free from defective workmanship or material and free from sinkholes or other settling. 
                  (2)  The subdivider deposits surety for the completion of such street improvements as shown on the final plat submitted for final approval, as provided in section 78-106, surety for completion of improvements, and surety is duly accepted by the city code enforcement officer.

                  Sec. 82-31. - Administration. 
                  (a)  Except as otherwise provided in this article, the city clerk shall be charged with the duty to administer the imposition, collection and enforcement of all taxes and special assessments levied or imposed by the city in accordance with the administrative procedures set forth in this article. To the extent this article fails to provide a designated procedure, the clerk shall act in the manner established, if any, for county tax collectors under applicable state law. 
                  (b)  In determining the fair market value of property within its taxing jurisdiction, the city shall use the fair market value as finally determined for the property for county ad valorem tax purposes. 
                  (c)  Following adoption of its current fiscal year budget, the city council shall, by resolution, adopt a millage rate upon which property subject to ad valorem tax will be billed. Prior to adoption of the millage rate, the city council shall publish the notice of proposed ad valorem tax rate as required by O.C.G.A. § 48-5-32. Millage rates shall be calculated using 40 percent of the assessed fair market value of the property upon which the tax is levied. 
                  (d)  The city clerk shall cause a bill to be sent to all taxpayers at the address last shown on the county tax digest by regular U.S. mail, with adequate postage; however, failure by the taxpayer to receive a bill shall not constitute grounds for nonpayment or late payment of the tax. The bill shall state the location or description of the property taxed, the fair market value of the property (100 percent) and its taxable value (40 percent of the fair market value), and the amount of tax due. The bill shall also state the due date after which taxes shall be in default. The bill may also contain such additional information as allowed by law or authorized by the city council.

                  Sec. 82-32. - Due date; payment; interest on past-due taxes. 
                  (a)  All ad valorem taxes shall be due and payable in full within 60 days after notice unless the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, in which case it shall be postponed until the first day following which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. Supplemental ad valorem taxes and special assessments shall be due and payable on the date set forth in the ordinance imposing the tax or assessment. 
                  (b)  All taxes and assessments imposed by the city shall be paid in full in legal tender of the United States; except where specially authorized by law or ordinance of the city council, no partial payments shall be accepted. 
                  (c)  Taxes and special assessments shall bear interest at the rate of one percent per month from the date the tax or assessment is due until the date the tax or assessment is paid. For purposes of this section, any period of less than one month shall be considered to be one full month. The city clerk may waive the collection of any interest, in whole or in part, due the city on unpaid taxes or assessments whenever or to the extent that he reasonably determines that the delay in payment was attributable to the action or inaction of his department.

                  Sec. 82-33. - Penalties. 
                  (a)  All penalties imposed by this article are part of the tax or assessment and are to be collected as such. The proceedings to collect the original tax, the tax constituted from penalties imposed, and the interest shall all be conducted in the same manner. Any provision of law for criminal prosecution shall not operate to relieve any taxpayer of any tax, penalty or interest imposed by this article. 
                  (b)  In any instance in which any taxpayer fails to pay a tax or assessment within 90 days of the due date, he shall pay a penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax due, together with interest as specified in this article. 
                  (c)  The city council may waive, in whole or in part, the collection of any amount due as a penalty under this article to the extent it finds and determines the default giving rise to the penalty was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect or disregard of this article.

                  Sec. 82-34. - Executions on delinquent taxes and assessments. 
                  (a)  As soon as the last day for the payment of taxes and assessments has arrived, the city clerk shall notify in writing the taxpayer of the fact that the taxes have not been paid and that, unless paid within 30 days, an execution shall be issued. 
                  (b)  The city clerk shall issue executions for the nonpayment of taxes and assessments at any time after 30 days have elapsed since giving notice as provided in subsection (a) of this section. The execution shall identify the defendant in fi. fa. (taxpayer), the year for which delinquent taxes are being executed, and the amount. Executions shall be directed to "all and singular sheriffs and constables of the state." 
                  (c)  The city clerk shall cause all executions issued to be recorded on the general execution docket of the county where the property is located, in the case of real property, and, in the case of personal property, in the county of the taxpayer's residence if a resident of the state, otherwise in the county where any real or personal property of the taxpayer may be found. If the taxpayer is not a resident of the state and has no known real or personal property within the state, the execution shall be recorded in the county in which the act or activity giving rise to tax liability took place. 
                  (d)  All executions issued shall continue to bear interest and penalties at the rates established in this article for past-due taxes and assessments. 
                  (e)  The city clerk shall cause all executions issued to be placed in the hands of the city marshal for collection or levy and sale of property. The marshal shall exercise his best efforts to collect the full amount of taxes and assessments due, together with all interest, penalties, and any costs due, from the defendant in fi. fa. If he is unable to do so, the marshal shall levy the execution on a sufficient amount of the defendant in fi. fa.'s property, whether real or personal, to satisfy the obligations due at a sale to be held and conducted in accordance with this article. 
                  (Ord. No. 96-4, § IV, 6-3-1996) 
                  Sec. 82-35. - Levy of executions; sale of property. 
                  (a)  The chief of police is designated as the marshal of the city and delegated the duties set forth in this article. The marshal shall be subject to being ruled for money in his hands arising from the public sale of any property pursuant to process issued by the city. After first paying the city clerk the amount due on the process under which the sale was made, the marshal shall pay any surplus to any lawful claimant holding an interest subordinate to the lien for taxes, else to the defendant in fi. fa. 
                  (b)  In all cases of levying on real property, within five days written notice of the levy must be given personally, or delivered by certified mail, to the defendant in fi. fa. and to any tenants in possession. If the land is unoccupied, a copy of the notice of levy shall also be conspicuously posted on the land. In the case of personal property, the marshal shall enter the levy on the execution and plainly describe the property levied on and the amount of the interest of the defendant in fi. fa. 
                  (c)  Whenever any real property is levied upon for taxes or assessments, it shall be the marshal's duty before proceeding to advertise the property for sale to give 20 days' written notice of the levy to the record owner of the property and the holder of each security deed of record. The 20-day period shall begin to run from the time the notice is personally delivered or, when delivered by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested, from the date of mailing. The notice shall contain a description of the land levied upon, the name of the owner of the land, the year or years for which the taxes were assessed, and a statement of the amount of the taxes due, together with accrued costs. The marshal shall keep a copy of the notice on which he shall enter the date the notice was delivered or mailed and how, where and to whom the notice was delivered. The marshal shall file the copy with the city clerk. 
                  (d)  When a levy is made upon real or personal property, the property shall be advertised and sold by the marshal in the same manner as provided for executions and judicial sales; however, in addition to such other notice as may be required by law, the defendant in fi. fa. shall be given at least ten days' written notice of such sale by registered or certified mail. The notice shall be addressed to the taxpayer at the last known address listed in the records of the county tax commissioner. In addition, if the United States has a claim or lien on the property subject to being sold and such lien was filed or recorded more than 30 days before the proposed sale, the marshal shall cause written notice of the sale to be given to the secretary of the treasury or his delegate not less than 25 days before the sale. Notice may be given either by personal service or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. 
                  (e)  The marshal shall publish weekly for four weeks in the official legal organ of the county in which the sale will be conducted an advertisement of the date, place and hours during which the sale will be conducted, together with a full and complete description of the property to be sold, making known the names of the owner of record and any person who may be in possession of the property. The notice shall state that the property is being sold for collection of taxes due to the city and the year for which taxes have been executed. 
                  (f)  Sales of property under execution shall be made by the marshal before the city hall on the first Tuesday in each month between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Saving Time, whichever is applicable, and at public outcry to the highest bidder for cash; however, should the first Tuesday of the month fall on New Year's Day or Independence Day, such sales shall take place on the immediately following Wednesday. The purchaser shall look for himself as to the title and soundness of all property sold under tax executions; and neither the marshal conducting the sale nor the city shall make any representations or warranty of title, condition or fitness for a particular purpose, expressed or implied. 
                  (g)  The marshal shall sell the property to the highest bidder for cash and, upon collection of the sales price, make a deed or bill of sale to the purchaser. Any person who becomes the purchaser of any property sold at the sale, who fails or refuses to comply with the terms of sale when requested by the marshal to do so, shall be liable for the amount of the purchase money. It shall be the option of the marshal either to proceed against the purchaser for the full amount of the purchase money or to resell the property and then proceed against the first purchaser for any deficiency. A tax deed for real property, or bill of sale for personal property, made and delivered as evidence of a sale for taxes conducted pursuant to this article shall convey the title as effectually as if the sale were made by the person against whom the process was issued. Sales of personal property shall be final; real property sold by virtue of an execution issued for the collection of taxes or for any special assessments is subject to redemption rights of the defendant in fi. fa. or any person having any right, title or interest in or lien upon such property at the time of levy and sale. Recitals in a deed or bill of sale under power of sale for taxes shall be prima facie evidence of the facts recited in the instrument. The marshal shall put the purchaser in possession of the property so sold; however, the purchaser of real property is not entitled to be placed in possession until after the time for redemption has expired. 
                  (h)  Whenever no bids are forthcoming on property sold for taxes after the property has been offered for a reasonable time, the marshal may either readvertise and sell the property at a later date or abandon the property. The marshal shall make a proper notation on the execution whenever property levied upon and exposed for sale has been abandoned due to lack of bids. 
                  (Ord. No. 96-4, § V, 6-3-1996) 
                  Sec. 82-36. - Bidding by city at tax sales; disposition of property acquired. 
                  (a)  If during any sale of property for taxes and after the property has been offered a reasonable time, no one present at the sale bids an amount for the property being sold which is as much as the total of the taxes due (including any priority liens for taxes due the state, county, and school and other special tax districts of the state) plus the marshal's cost due on the sale, the city manager may purchase the property for the city. If the city purchases property at a sale, the marshal shall make to the city a deed to the property sold and shall deliver the deed to the city manager. The marshal shall put the city in possession of the property so sold. 
                  (b)  Property acquired by the city pursuant to a sale for taxes or assessments may be delivered or alienated by the city only by public sale of the property to the highest bidder; however, when the city has not parted with title to the property, the city may quitclaim the property to the owner at the time of the tax sale, or the owner's administrators, executors, heirs or assigns, upon full payment of the redemption price provided in section 82-34. 
                  (c)  The right of redemption in real property purchased by the city at a tax sale shall be foreclosed in the manner set forth in section 82-34. 
                  (Ord. No. 96-4, § VI, 6-3-1996) 
                  Sec. 82-37. - Accounting by marshal; final return or settlement. 
                  (a)  The marshal shall make a prompt accounting to the city clerk for all executions placed in his hands for collection or levy and sale. He shall pay over to the clerk all amounts due the city for taxes and assessments, interest, penalties and costs, and shall file a final written return or settlement showing the amounts so paid, together with disposition of any excess proceeds derived from the sale. If there is any excess after paying taxes, costs and all expenses of a sale, it shall be immediately paid to the person authorized to receive the excess. 
                  (b)  In any event, if within 90 days from the date executions are placed in his hands the marshal finds an execution to be either uncollectible or not collectible in full, he shall so notify the city clerk in writing. It shall be the duty of the clerk to cause cancellation of executions on the general execution docket of the county upon their final payment or collection. 
                  (Ord. No. 96-4, § VII, 6-3-1996) 
                  Sec. 82-38. - Garnishments by city; reduction of executions to judgment. 
                  (a)  Whenever the marshal can find no property belonging to a defendant in fi. fa. on which to levy any tax execution in his hands, he shall make an entry to that effect on the execution. The city clerk, in the name of the city, may then petition any court of competent jurisdiction to issue a summons of garnishment against any person whom he believes to be indebted to the defendant in fi. fa. or who has property, money or effects in his hands belonging to the defendant in fi. fa. The clerk shall enter upon the execution the names of the persons garnished and the court and file number of the action where the garnishment is filed. All subsequent proceedings shall be the same as provided by law in other cases where judgments have been obtained or execution issued. 
                  (b)  When an execution for taxes remains unsatisfied and an entry of nulla bona has been entered by the marshal on the execution within the immediately preceding 30-day period and the city clerk has reason to believe the defendant in fi. fa. may have or may come into ownership of assets outside the state, the clerk, in the name of the city, may petition the superior court of the county in the state in which the defendant in fi. fa. maintains a known residence, place of business, or agent to receive service, to reduce the execution to judgment. If the defendant in fi. fa. does not maintain a known residence in this state, the action may be brought in the county where the tax obligation arose. This and all subsequent proceedings shall be brought in accordance with O.C.G.A. Title 48, Chapter 3. 
                  (Ord. No. 96-4, § VIII, 6-3-1996) 
                  Sec. 82-39. - Redemption rights of defendant in fi. fa.; vesting of title in grantee. 
                  (a)  Whenever real property is sold for taxes or any special assessment, the defendant in fi. fa. or any person having any right, title or interest in or lien upon such property may redeem the property from the sale by the payment of the redemption price or the amount required for redemption as fixed by O.C.G.A. § 48-5-42, at any time within 12 months from the date of sale, and at any time after the sale until the right to redeem is foreclosed by the giving of the notice provided for in O.C.G.A. § 48-5-45, which sections by reference are incorporated in this section as part of this article. 
                  (b)  Where notice of foreclosure of the right to redeem real property sold at a tax sale has not been given as required in subsection (a) of this section, title shall ripen by prescription after a period of four years from the date of recording of the deed in the county where the property is situated, provided the defendant in fi. fa. was not laboring under any legal disability at the time of sale. Unless the tax deed indicates a lesser interest was levied upon and sold, a fee simple title to the property shall vest absolutely in the grantee in the deed or in the grantee's heirs or assigns. If the defendant in fi. fa. is laboring under any legal disability, the prescriptive term shall begin from the time the disabilities are removed or abated.

                  Sec. 82-40. - Costs. 
                  (a)  For issuing executions, the city shall receive only an amount equal to any filing fees charged by the clerk of the superior court for recording and cancellation of the tax fi. fa. 
                  (b)  Once a levy is made or posted on the property of a defendant in fi. fa., in addition to all taxes, interest, penalties and costs accrued, the marshal shall collect a levy administration fee of five percent of the taxes due or $250.00, whichever is the lesser; however, no levy administration fee shall be less than $50.00. 
                  (c)  In addition to the levy administration fee, after levy but prior to the sale, the marshal shall collect his actual cost for advertising the sale, postage and service fees actually incurred, and any attorney's fees incurred in examination of title to property, plus a commission for conducting the sale, not to exceed eight percent on sums of $50.00 or less, six percent on sums above $50.00 up to $550.00, and three percent on all sums exceeding $550.00. 
                  (d)  The costs provided in this section shall be cumulative and in addition to any statutory premiums allowed as a part of the redemption price.

                  Sec. 86-69. - Applicability. 
                  (a)  District height limitations. The requirements set forth in this article shall govern the location of towers that exceed, and antennas that are installed at a height in excess of, the height limitations specified for each zoning district in chapter 6 of the planning and development ordinance. The height limitations applicable to buildings and structures in the zoning ordinance as set forth in appendix A shall not apply to towers and antennas. 
                  (b)  Public property. Antennas or towers located on property owned, leased or otherwise controlled by the city council shall be exempt from the requirements of this article, provided a license or lease authorizing such antenna or tower has been approved by the city council. 
                  (c)  Amateur radio: receiver-only antennas. This article shall not govern any tower, or the installation of any antenna, that is under 70 feet in height and is owned and operated by a federally licensed amateur radio station operator or is used exclusively for receiver-only antennas. 
                  (d)  Preexisting towers and antennas. Any tower or antenna for which a permit has been properly issued prior to the effective date of this article shall not be required to meet the requirements of this article, other than the requirements of sections 86-71(c) through (f) of this section.

                  Sec. 86-70. - Preferred and disfavored location sites. 
                  (a)  Preferred location sites. 
                  (1)  Collocation sites. Any existing telecommunications towers currently being used for transmitting or receiving analog, digital, microwave, cellular, telephone, personal wireless service or similar forms of electronic communication shall be a preferred location site regardless of the underlying zoning designation of a site; however locations which meet this criterion shall be subject to design and siting components of this article, and collocation sites shall not become an "antenna farm" or otherwise be deemed by the zoning administrator or the city council to be visually obtrusive. 
                  (2)  Publically used structures. Publically used structures are preferred locations throughout the city because they appear in virtually all neighborhoods, are dispersed throughout the city, and due to their institutional or infrastructure uses are generally similar in appearance to or readily adaptable for telecommunications facilities. Therefore, telecommunications facilities should be less noticeable when placed on publically used structures, placed on commercial or residential structures. Publically used structures include but are not limited to facilities such as police or fire stations, libraries, community centers, civic centers, courthouses, utility structures, water towers, elevated roadways, bridges, flagpoles, schools, hospitals, clock or bell towers, lightpoles and churches. 
                  (3)  Industrial and commercial structures. Wholly industrial and commercial structures such as warehouses, factories, retail outlets, supermarkets, banks, garages or service stations shall be preferred locations, particularly where existing visual obstructions or clutter on the roof or along the roofline can and will be removed as part of the installation of the telecommunications facility. 
                  (4)  Mixed-use buildings in high-density districts. Mixed-use buildings (housing above commercial or other nonresidential space) are also preferred location sites. 
                  (b)  Disfavored location sites. Any single-family residential structure or site or multifamily duplex shall be a disfavored site for a location of telecommunications facilities. 
                  (Ord. No. 98-07, § 8-9-6, 4-13-1998) 
                  Sec. 86-71. - General guidelines and requirements. 
                  (a)  Principal or accessory use. Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use or an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with district development regulations, including but not limited to setback requirements, lot-coverage requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots. Towers that are constructed and antennas that are installed in accordance with the provisions of this article shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure. 
                  (b)  Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for an antenna or tower shall provide to the planning commission an inventory of its existing towers that are either within the jurisdiction of the city council or within one-quarter mile of the border, including specific information about the location, height coverage area, and design of each tower. The planning commission may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals or special use permits under this article or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the city council; however, the planning commission is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. 
                  (c)  Aesthetics; lighting. The guidelines set forth in this section shall govern the location of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this article; however, the city council may waive these requirements if it determines that the goals of this article are better served by such waiver. 
                  (1)  Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  (2)  At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
                  (3)  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to or closely compatible with the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
                  (4)  Towers shall not be artificially lighted unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the city council may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. 
                  (d)  Federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this article shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the city council shall be in the manner provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8—41-2-17. 
                  (e)  Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended. If upon inspection the governing authority concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within 30 days, the city council may remove such tower at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the city council shall be in the manner provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8—41-2-17. 
                  (f)  Licenses and authority. Owners and/or operators of towers and antennas shall certify that all franchises required by law for the construction and/or operation of a wireless communication system in the city have been obtained and shall file a copy of all required franchises and/or licenses with the city.

                  (b)  Information required. Each applicant requesting a special use permit under this section shall submit a scaled site plan and a scaled elevation view and other supporting drawings, calculations and other documentation, signed and sealed by appropriate licensed professionals, showing the location and dimensions of all improvements, including information concerning topography, radio frequency coverage, tower height requirements, setbacks, drives, parking, fencing, landscaping, adjacent uses, and other information deemed by the city council to be necessary to assess compliance with this article. 
                  (c)  Factors considered in granting special use permits. The council shall consider the following factors in determining whether to issue a special use permit, although the council may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one or more of these criteria if the council concludes that the goals of this article are better served by the waiver or reduction: 
                  (1)  Height of the proposed tower; 
                  (2)  Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential district boundaries; 
                  (3)  Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties; 
                  (4)  Surrounding topography; 
                  (5)  Surrounding tree coverage and foliage; 
                  (6)  Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness; 
                  (7)  Proposed ingress and egress; and 
                  (8)  Availability of suitable existing towers and other structures as discussed in section 86-69. 
                  (d)  Availability of suitable existing towers or other structures. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may consist of any of the following: 
                  (1)  No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet the applicant's engineering requirements. 
                  (2)  Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements. 
                  (3)  Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment. 
                  (4)  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
                  (5)  The fees, costs or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable. 
                  (6)  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
                  (e)  Setbacks and separation. The following setbacks and separation requirements shall apply to all towers and antennas for which a special use permit is required; however, the city council may reduce the standard setbacks and separation requirements if the goals of this article would be better served. 
                  (1)  Towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower from any on- or off-site residential structure. 
                  (2)  Towers and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements. 
                  (3)  In zoning districts other than I-1, I-2 or C-2 zoning districts, towers over 90 feet in height shall not be located within one-quarter mile from any existing tower that is over 90 feet in height. 
                  (f)  Security fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall also be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device; however, the council may waive such requirements, as it deems appropriate. 
                  (g)  Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the landscaping surrounding towers for which a special use permit is required; however, the council may waive such requirements if the goals of this article would be better served: 
                  (1)  Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from adjacent residential property. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least four feet wide outside the perimeter of the compound. 
                  (2)  In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived altogether. 
                  (3)  Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter may be sufficient buffer.

                  Sec. 86-76. - Provisions applicable to all telecommunications facilities. 
                  (a)  Public notice. For purposes of this article, any special use request, variance request or appeal of an administratively approved use or special use shall require public notice to all abutting property owners and all property owners of properties that are located within the corresponding separation distance listed in this section. 
                  (b)  Signs. No signs shall be allowed on an antenna or tower. 
                  (c)  Buildings and support equipment. Buildings and support equipment associated with antennas or towers shall comply with the requirements of this section. 
                  (d)  Multiple antenna tower plan. The city encourages the users of towers and antennas to submit a single application for approval of multiple towers and/or antenna sites. Applications for approval of multiple sites shall be given priority in the review process. 
                  (e)  Use of guy or guide wires prohibited. No telecommunications facility shall use guy or guide wires or the like, and no approval shall issue for a telecommunication facility design incorporating guy or guide wires or the like.

                  Sec. 86-77. - Removal of abandoned antennas and towers. 
                  All towers regulated by this article shall be covered by a removal bond sufficient to cover costs and expenses of removal. This removal bond shall be and remain in effect for the life of the tower. Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 120 days shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove the tower within 90 days of receipt of notice from the city council notifying the owner of such abandonment. If such antenna or tower is not removed within 90 days, the council may, in the manner provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8—41-2-17, remove such antenna or tower at the owner's expense. If there are two or more users of a single tower, this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the tower. The removed tower will be sold for scrap, with the proceeds first applied to the costs of removal and disposal by city; any surplus amounts of sale will be returned to tower owner if the owner is known to the city.

                  Sec. 86-78. - Penalty for violation of article. 
                  (a)  Any person who attempts to erect or erects a telecommunications facility covered by this article without having first obtained the necessary building permit, special use permit or variance in the manner provided in this article shall be deemed in violation of this article. Any responsible party or other persons convicted by a court of competent jurisdiction of violating any provision of this article shall be guilty of violating a duly adopted ordinance of the city and shall be punished as provided in Charter section 4.13. The courts have the power and authority to place any person guilty of a violation of this article on probation and to suspend or modify any fine or sentence. As a condition of such suspension, the court may require payment of restitution or impose other punishment allowed by law. 
                  (b)  If any structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted or maintained in violation of this article or without retaining the required permits, or if any building, structure or land is used in violation of this article, the city attorney, in addition to any other remedies, may institute proceedings to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion, maintenance or use or to correct or obey such violations. Each day such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion, maintenance or use is continued may be deemed a separate offense.

                  Sec. 86-79. - Coordination with federal law. 
                  Whenever the city council finds that the application of this article would unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services or prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, a conditional use permit waiving any or all of the provisions of this article may be granted.

Customer will be allowed 30 days from the original cutoff date to either pay the bill in full or make arrangements for someone else to provide the care. If payment is not made within said 30 days, a certified notice will be mailed on the final day of the 30-day extension, giving notice that service will be discontinued on the third day following the date of certified notice. (If date of notice is the first day of the month, proposed cutoff would be on the fourth day of the month at 1:00 p.m.) In this case, service may not be discontinued without the city council's prior approval, and it may send a representative to verify the type of equipment if it so chooses.

Should the tenant wish to secure service in his own name, such arrangements must be made with the city prior to three days from said notice date. Such service will be provided to the tenant without his having to clear any prior delinquencies on behalf of his landlord/lessor.

                  The providing of sanitary sewer service is an expensive undertaking and requires extensive capital outlay, the cost of which must be recouped in order to build other sewage systems to ensure the public safety, health and welfare. In order to recover the capital outlay, it is necessary to require full utilization of the sewage system and the City of Fort Oglethorpe has determined that it is necessary to charge the minimum for sanitary sewer service when a gravity flow sanitary sewer service is available to a resident or property owner and the resident or property owner refuses or elects not to connect to the sanitary sewer system.

                  Sec. 3.3. - Rules for determining boundaries. 
                  Where uncertainty exists as to boundaries of any district shown on the official zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 
                  a)  Where such district boundaries are indicated as approximately following street lines, alley lines or lot lines, such lines shall be construed to be such boundaries. 
                  b)  In unsubdivided property or where a district boundary divides a lot, the location of such boundary, unless the same is indicated by dimensions, shall be determined by the use of the scale appearing on the original map. Where a district boundary divides a lot, the zone classification of the greater portion shall prevail throughout the lot. 
                  c)  In case any further uncertainty exists, the governing body shall interpret the intent of the map as to the location of such boundaries. 
                  d)  Where any street or alley is officially vacated or abandoned, the regulations applicable to each parcel of abutting property shall apply to that portion of such street or alley added thereto by virtue of such vacation or abandonment. 
                  Sec. 3.4. - Adopted by reference. 
                  The zoning map on file in the office of the city clerk of Fort Oglethorpe, the City of Fort Oglethorpe comprehensive plan, adult entertainment ordinance, telecommunications tower and antenna ordinance, the City of Fort Oglethorpe sign ordinance, historic preservation ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance and soil erosion and sedimentation control ordinance (adoption dates as amended) are hereby adopted by reference as fully and to the same effect as though set out at length herein.

                  a)  Land. 
                  1.  The lawful use of land existing at the time of the enactment of the ordinance from which this section is derived, although such use does not conform to the provisions of this ordinance, may be continued; provided, [however,] that no such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor shall any nonconforming use be extended to occupy a greater area of land that than occupied by such use at the time of such enactment. 
                  2.  If such nonconforming use shall be discontinued for a continuous period of 90 days, any future use of such land shall be in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance. 
                  b)  Buildings. 
                  1.  The lawful use of a building or structure existing at the time of the enactment of this ordinance may be continued, although such does not conform to the provisions of this ordinance. 
                  2.  Such use may be extended throughout the building, provided no structural alterations, except those required by law or ordinances, or ordered by an authorized officer to ensure the safety of the building, are made therein. 
                  3.  No such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building. 
                  4.  If such nonconforming building is removed or the nonconforming use of such building is discontinued for a continuous period of 90 days, every future use of such premises shall be in conformity with the provision[s] of this ordinance.

                  a)  When a district shall be changed, any then existing nonconforming use in such changed district may be continued or changed to a use of similar or higher classification, provided all other regulations governing the new use are complied with. 
                  b)  Whenever a nonconforming use has been discontinued or changed to a higher classification or to conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a nonconforming use or a lower classification. 
                  ARTICLE IV. - REGULATIONS GENERALLY 

                  Sec. 4.1. - Conformity with district regulations. 
                  No building shall be moved, erected, reconstructed or structurally altered, nor shall any building or land be used which does not comply with all the district regulations specified by this ordinance for the district in which the building or land is located. 
                  Sec. 4.2. - Lot regulations. 
                  a)  Substandard lots. Any residentially zoned lot which was of record at the time of the adoption of this ordinance that does not meet the requirements of this ordinance for yards or other area or open space, may be utilized for single-residence purposes, provided: 
                  1.  The area for such yard or court in width, depth, or open space is not less than 75 percent of that required by the terms of this ordinance, excepting that vacant lots having in the aggregate a continuous frontage of 120 feet or more shall not be subject to this exception; 
                  2.  In the absence of an approved community water supply and/or wastewater treatment system, said lot can meet the requirements of the county health department for the installation of wells and/or septic tanks. The purpose is to permit utilization of recorded lots which lack adequate width of depth as long as reasonable health and living standards can be provided. 
                  When a subdivision of land or portion thereof contains lots or parcels of land that do not conform to the lot area or lot frontage provisions of this ordinance, and such tract of land is under one ownership and has remained unimproved or undeveloped for a period of five years from the effective date of this ordinance, it shall be incumbent upon the owner of such tract to replat the tract to conform to the minimum area and frontage provisions of this ordinance for the district in which the lands are located. 
                  b)  Lot may not be reduced in size below minimum requirements. No parcel of land, even though it may consist of one or more adjacent lots of record, shall be reduced in size so that lot width or depth, front, side, or rear yard, inner or outer courts, lot area per unit, or other requirements of this ordinance are not maintained. This section shall not apply when a portion of a lot is acquired for public use. 
                  c)  Lot size. All lots shall conform to the area requirements set forth in the zoning districts in which they are located. Residential corner lots shall have adequate width to permit appropriate building setbacks from and orientation to both abutting streets. 
                  d)  Building lines. A building line, meeting the front, rear and side yard setback requirements of the zoning district in which the parcel of land is located, shall be established on all lots. 
                  e)  Double frontage lots. Double frontage lots should be avoided, except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. When allowed, a strip of land at least ten feet in width, and across which there shall be no right of access, shall be provided along the lot or line of lots abutting such traffic artery. 
                  f)  Lots must abut public street. No building or structure shall be erected on a lot or portion of a lot which does not have a minimum of a 25-foot easement to a public road for ingress and egress. Shopping center developments with interior lots shall be allowed, but will be required to submit a thoroughfare plan showing ingress and egress from the property to the adjoining street system. 
                  g)  Access to public streets. Access to public streets shall be maintained in accordance with a minimum of a 25-foot easement to a public road for ingress and egress.

                  b)  Tractor trailer combinations, tractors or trailers shall not be placed or stored in residentially zoned districts, that would limit access or safety on public streets (see section 6.10). 
                  c)  Kennels [shall be prohibited], except in the RA zoning district (see section 14.3(j)). 
                  Sec. 4.4. - Accessory and temporary buildings. 
                  a)  Accessory buildings. Location and uses of accessory buildings in all zoning districts shall be governed by the following conditions:

                  2.  Detached from main dwelling. A detached accessory building shall not be closer than three feet to a lot line. 
                  3.  Height and lot coverage requirements for detached accessory building. A detached accessory building shall not exceed 12 feet in height and shall not be located in a front yard nor cover more than 35 percent of the side or rear yard. 
                  b)  Temporary buildings. Temporary buildings may be used only in conjunction with construction work in any zoning district and shall be removed immediately upon the completion of construction. A certificate of zoning compliance must be obtained for use of a temporary building. 
                  c)  Satellite dish antennae. Satellite dishes shall be treated as accessory structures. 
                  Sec. 4.5. - Buildings to be located on lots. 
                  Every building hereafter erected or structurally altered shall be located on a lot, and in no case shall there be more than one principal building and the customary accessory buildings on one lot or parcel of land. 
                  Sec. 4.6. - Locations of structures on residential lots. 
                  a)  No detached accessory building shall be located on the front yard of a lot. 
                  b)  When an accessory building is attached to a principal structure by a breezeway, roofed passage or otherwise, it shall comply with the dimensional requirements of the principal building.

                  e)  In any residential district, no fence or structure shall be maintained within 25 feet of any corner street intersection, nor beyond the front building line. 
                  f)  No dwelling shall be erected on a lot or portion of a lot which does not abut a minimum of a 25-foot easement to a public road for ingress and egress. 
                  (Ord. No. 2004-12, 9-13-2004) 
                  Sec. 4.7. - Site distance at intersections. 
                  In all zoning districts, no fence, wall, hedge, or shrub planting which obstructs the site lines at elevations between two and 12 feet above the roadways shall be placed on any corner lot within the triangular area formed by the street property lines and a line connecting them at points 25 feet from the intersection of the street lines, or in the case of a rounded property corner, from the intersection of the street property lines. 
                  Sec. 4.8. - Building height restrictions. 
                  a)  General application. No building or structure shall hereafter be erected, constructed, or altered so as to exceed the height limits specified in this ordinance and set out for the district in which it is located. 
                  b)  Permitted exceptions to height regulations. The building height restrictions imposed on buildings and structures by this ordinance for each zoning district shall not apply to the following buildings or structures: 
                  1.  Churches, schools, hospitals, sanitariums, and other public buildings and public utility structures. There shall be no restriction on the height of such buildings or structures, provided on the front, side, and rear yards required in the district in which such building is to be located shall be increased an additional one foot for each ten feet that the building exceeds the maximum height permitted in the district; 
                  2.  Barns, silos, grain elevators, other farm structures, belfries, cupolas, domes, monuments, water towers, transmission towers, windmills, chimneys, smokestacks, flagpoles, radio towers, masts, and aerials; and

                  None of these exceptions to height limits shall apply to temporary or business signs which shall be subject to all height limitations of the district in which they are located and other applicable requirements as listed in the Fort Oglethorpe sign ordinance. 
                  Sec. 4.9. - Yards. 
                  a)  Every part of a required yard shall be open from its lowest point to the sky, unobstructed, except for the ordinary projections of sills, belt courses, cornices, buttresses, ornamental features, chimneys and eaves, but none of these projections shall project into a minimum side yard more than 24 inches. 
                  b)  On double frontage lots, the required front yard shall be provided on each street. 
                  c)  Open or enclosed fire escapes, fireproof outside stairways and balconies may project into a minimum yard or court not more than 3.5 feet. Ordinary projections of chimneys and flues shall be permitted.

                  Sec. 4.10. - Buffer areas and screening. 
                  The use of buffer areas and screening reduces potential incompatibility between or among different uses of land in proximity to each other. Where the commission determines what a proposed use(s) of land or the granting of a variance from the requirements of this ordinance would have an unfavorable impact on adjoining use(s) or the granting of a permit for such use or variance, a permanent buffer area or screening [shall be established]. 
                  a)  Buffer areas. Buffer areas, when required, shall be established and permanently maintained under the following provisions: 
                  1.  Be maintained as a planted area (or landscaped berm), using existing vegetation, or, when required, additional plantings as provided below;

                  5.  The natural topography of the land shall be preserved, and natural growth shall not be disturbed beyond that which is necessary to prevent a nuisance, or to thin this natural growth where too dense for normal growth, or to remove diseased or dangerous and decayed timbers. However, with planning commission approval, a slope easement may be cleared and graded, where required to prevent soil erosion. This easement may cover no more than 20 percent of the required buffer area, and shall be immediately replanted upon completion of easement improvement; [and] 
                  6.  Where, by reason of the topography of the land or by reason of the prior removal or lack of timber and foliage, the owner of the buffer area may be required to erect a permanent wall or fence of not less than six feet in height or screen of evergreen plantings, so designed and developed to provide visual screening. These plantings shall consist of evergreen shrubs which will, with normal growth, attain a height of six feet within three years.

                  a)  All automobile service stations shall conform to the following requirements: 
                  1.  All pumps shall be set back at least 15 feet from the right-of-way line, or where a future widening setback line has been established, this setback shall be measured from such line. Pumps shall be set back at least 15 feet from any property line. 
                  2.  The number of curb breaks shall not exceed two for each 100 feet of street frontage, each having a width of not more than 30 feet or less than 25 feet and located not closer than 15 feet to a street intersection. Two or more curb breaks on the same street shall be separated by an area of not less than ten feet. 
                  3.  When the station abuts a residential district, it shall be separated therefrom by a solid wall or equivalent planting screen at least six feet high.

                  a)  Satellite receiving dish antenna shall be allowed in all zoning districts. 
                  b)  However, in all residential zones, the following requirements will apply: 
                  1.  Antenna will be erected only in a rear or side yard and the setback requirements from the property line will be the same as those required of an accessory building. 
                  2.  Location of the antenna must be approved by the building inspection department before installation can begin. 
                  c)  In all other zoning districts, antenna will be so placed as not to create a hazard to traffic or public utilities. 
                  d)  A property owner who has in place a nonconforming antenna at the effective date of this ordinance may continue to maintain the antenna. 
                  Sec. 4.14. - Compatibility standards for homes. 
                  Manufactured homes, site built, modular and other housing qualifying as a dwelling, single-family, shall meet the following compatibility standards to protect and preserve the overall existing character of established neighborhoods and the property values of the residential area. Compatibility standards are as follows: 
                  a)  Manufactured homes qualifying as dwelling, single-family, shall be compared to site built and other housing in the immediate general area within the same zoning or residential district or area.

                  Sec. 4.15. - Special exception requirements. 
                  Zoning districts permit certain uses only upon the recommendation of the planning commission. These are called special exceptions. Consideration is given to whether or not the objectives of this ordinance will be hindered in an individual situation. Special exception standards are outlined in section 7.4 of this ordinance and are designed to help the commission in the decision making process.

Existing and future land use maps of the city and county must be thoroughly considered by the planning commission and city council when determining in which zoning district an area of land is to be classified. This will ensure that rational comprehensive planning principles are the basis upon which the decision is made.

                  d)  Consideration of the proposed zoning change shall be carried out as prescribed in the zoning policies and procedures of section 7.5. If the rezoning amendment is defeated, then the same property may not again be considered for rezoning until the expiration of at least six months immediately following the defeat of the rezoning. 
                  e)  Consideration of a request for a special exception shall be carried out according to the following criteria: 
                  Will be consistent with the comprehensive plan for the physical development of the district, including any master plan or portion thereof adopted by the commission.

The Fort Oglethorpe city council and the Fort Oglethorpe planning commission will each hold at least one public hearing on any new zoning ordinance development or any proposed amendment to the current zoning ordinance. 
                  b)  Public hearing. Upon the completion of a preliminary zoning document(s) by the planning commission and after this draft document has been presented to and reviewed by the city council, public hearings will be scheduled by both the Fort Oglethorpe planning commission and the city council, respectively.

                  d)  Review of amendments. All amendments to any existing zoning plan must be reviewed by both the Fort Oglethorpe planning commission and the city council. However, when the boundary lines of an established zoning district are proposed for changes (rezoning), the city council shall have the planning commission prepare an evaluation of each such proposed rezoning considering each of the following factors adopted in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 36-66-5(b). 
                  1.  The existing land uses and zoning classification of nearby property;

                  4  The extent to which the destruction of property values of the subject property promotes the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public; 
                  5.  The relative gain to the public as compared to the hardship imposed upon the individual property owner; 
                  6.  Whether the subject property has a reasonable economic use as currently zoned; 
                  7.  The length of time the property has been vacant as zoned considered in the context of land development in the area in the vicinity of the property; 
                  8.  Whether the proposed zoning will be a use that is suitable in view of the use and development of adjacent and nearby property; 
                  9.  Whether the proposed zoning will adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property; 
                  10.  Whether the zoning proposal is in conformity with the policies and intent of the land use plan; 
                  11.  Whether the zoning proposal will result in a use which will or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities or schools; [or] 
                  12.  Whether there are other existing or changing conditions affecting the use and development of the property which give supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the zoning proposal. 
                  e)  Place of hearing. The public hearings will be convened at the advertised time and place and will be presided over by the appropriate officials. 
                  f)  Conduct of hearing. The presider of each respective public hearing will review for those present, the following operating procedures for the public hearing.

                  2.  The person speaking will be allowed a reasonable amount of time to express opinions and make comments on each separate element of the proposed revisions which they wish to address; provided, however, that the proponents and opponents of each zoning decision or application shall have an equal minimum time period of not less than ten minutes per side for presentation of data, evidence and opinion.

The chairman, or his delegate on the planning commission, shall enter into the record after the presentation of the applicant or his/her representative, any written comment, petition or similar written statement, photographs or any other evidence received by the planning commission and submitted to the planning commission, during the public hearing and such documents and/or exhibits shall be considered by the planning commission with comments and proceedings of the public hearing in making its recommendation to the mayor and council as to any zoning decision concerning the proposed zoning amendment or special exception according to the standards outlined in section[s] 7.6(d) and 7.4(e). 
                  g)  Recommendation of planning commission.

                  h)  Consideration by city council.

Such appeals shall be made within 30 days of the zoning administrator's decision by filing with the zoning administrator and with the planning commission a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The zoning administrator shall forthwith transmit to the board of appeals all of the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. 
                  (a)  An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action, appealed from, unless the zoning administrator certifies to the planning commission, after the notice of appeal has been filed with him/her that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his/her opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the proceedings shall not be stayed, otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by a court of record. 
                  (b)  Any persons, jointly or severally, aggrieved by any decision of the mayor and council, the planning commission, board of appeals; any taxpayer; any officer or department of the city may present to a court of record petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of the legality.

                  Sec. 8.2. - Powers of the board of appeals and mayor and council concerning appeals and variances. 
                  (a)  Purpose. 
                  (1)  The board of appeals shall initially hear and make recommendations to the mayor and council where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of this article. 
                  (2)  The board of appeals shall make recommendations to the mayor and council upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of the article as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the article will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship so that the spirit of this article shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Such variance may be granted by the mayor and council, regardless of the recommendation made by the board of appeals in such individual case of unnecessary hardship upon finding by the mayor and council that: 
                  a.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography; 
                  b.  The application of this article to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship; 
                  c.  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved, and not of the making of the applicant; 
                  d.  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of this article, provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a sue of land or building or structure that is prohibited by this article; and 
                  e.  In no case may a variance be granted for a use of land or building (a "use variance") that is prohibited within the zoning district. 
                  In exercising the above powers, the mayor and council may, in conformity with the provisions of this article, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirements, decision, or determination, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken in relation to this article and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit. x 
                  (b)  Authorization. In hearing and deciding appeals, the mayor and council shall have the authority to grant such variances therefrom as may be in harmony with their general purpose and intent, so that the function of this article be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done, including the following: 
                  (1)  Interpret the provisions of the article in such a way as to carry out the intent and purpose of the plan, as shown upon the zoning map fixing the use districts, accompanying and made part of this article, where street layout actually on the ground varies from the street layout as shown on the map aforesaid. In case of any question as to the location of the boundary line between zoning districts the board of appeals shall interpret the zoning map. 
                  (2)  Permit the erection and use of a building or use of premises for public utility purposes. 
                  (3)  Permit the modification of the off-street automobile parking space or loading space requirements where, in the particular instance, such modifications will not be inconsistent with the purpose and intent of such requirements. 
                  (4)  Permit such modification of the height and area regulations as may be necessary to secure an appropriate improvement of a lot which is of such shape or so located with relation to surrounding development or physical characteristics that it cannot otherwise be appropriately improved without such modification. 
                  (5)  Permit temporary buildings and uses for periods not to exceed six months. 
                  (6)  Establish performance bonds to insure compliance of any requirement which may be deemed necessary for approving any variance. 
                  In making its recommendations to the mayor and council, the board of appeals shall also consider the above criteria. 
                  (c)  Application. 
                  (1)  A majority vote of a quorum of the mayor and council shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirements, decision or determination of the zoning administrator or issue a variance in favor of the applicant in any matter upon which it is authorized by this article to render a decision. 
                  (2)  A majority vote of a quorum of the members of the board of appeals shall be necessary to recommend the reversal of any order, requirements, decision or determination of the zoning administrator, or to recommend issuance of a variance in favor of the applicant in any matter upon which it is authorized by this article to recommend a decision. 
                  (d)  Standards. In consideration of all appeals and all proposed variations to this article, the mayor and council shall, before making any variations from the article in a specific case, first determine that the proposed variation complies with the conditions set forth in this section (a)(2); and in addition, meets the following general standards. 
                  (1)  The proposed use will be of such location, size and character that it will be in harmony with the appropriate and orderly development of the surrounding neighborhood. 
                  (2)  The proposed use will be of a nature that will make vehicular and pedestrian traffic no more hazardous than is normal for the district involved, taking into consideration vehicular turning movements in relation to routes of traffic flow, proximity and relationship to intersections, adequacy of sigh distances, location and access of off-street parking and provisions for pedestrian traffic, with particular attention to minimizing child-vehicle contacts in residential districts. 
                  (3)  The location, size, intensity, site layout and periods of operation of any such proposed use will be designed to eliminate any possible nuisance emanating therefrom which might be noxious to the occupants of any other nearby permitted uses, whether by reason of dust, noise, fumes, vibration, smoke or lights. 
                  (4)  The location and height of buildings or structures and the location, nature and height of walls and fences will be such that the proposed use will not interfere with or discourage the appropriate development and use of adjacent land and buildings or unreasonably affect their value. 
                  The board of appeals, in making its recommendations, shall also consider the above general standards. 
                  (e)  Conditions. The mayor and council, acting on any appeal in connection with a request for waiver, may attach any conditions to its approval which it finds necessary to accomplish the reasonable application of the foregoing standards. 
                  In exercising the above powers, the mayor and council may reverse or affirm wholly or partly, or modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from, and may make such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the zoning administrator from whom the appeal is taken in relation to this article.

                  ARTICLE XXIII. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT-MIXED USE [PM] 

                  Sec. 23.1. - Purpose. 
                  a)  PM zoning districts are intended to: 
                  1.  Encourage the development of large tracts of land as planned neighborhoods or communities. 
                  2.  Encourage flexible and creative concepts in site planning. 
                  3.  Preserve the natural amenities of the land by encouraging scenic and functional open areas within residential areas. 
                  4.  Create a more desirable environment than would be possible through the strict application of minimum requirements of other sections of this ordinance. 
                  5.  Provide for efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets as well as lower development and housing costs. 
                  6.  Provide an environment of stable character which is compatible with surrounding residential areas. 
                  b)  Within the planned area [PM district], a variety of land uses may be permitted in an orderly relation to one another and to existing land uses. This may be accomplished through the application of sound comprehensive planning principles 
                  Sec. 23.2. - Determining if an area is suitable for inclusion within a PM district. 
                  The factors contained in section 23.1 of this ordinance, as well as data submitted with the development plan of the applicant for a planned development, must be thoroughly considered by the planning commission as well as the mayor and city council when determining in which zoning district an area of land is to be placed. This will ensure that rational comprehensive planning principles encourage the development and preservation of land use patterns that provide healthful and safe living conditions for the residents of Fort Oglethorpe. 
                  Sec. 23.3. - Permitted uses. 
                  [Permitted uses in the PM district shall be] as shown in the approved development plan. 
                  Sec. 23.4. - Plan review and approval procedures. 
                  a)  Preapplication conference. Prior to filing a formal application for a PM [district], the applicant is encouraged to confer with the zoning administrator and the planning commission in order to review the general character of the plan (on the basis of tentative land use sketch, if available), and to obtain information on development standards and ordinances affecting the proposed project. 
                  b)  Submission of application for PM [district] approval. 
                  1.  The applicant must file a petition with the zoning administrator for approval of the proposed PM. This application must be supported by a development plan and a written summary of intent. The relationship between the proposed development and the surrounding area, both existing and proposed, must be shown. The following information must be presented with the application: 
                  A.  A general location map. 
                  B.  Existing topographic conditions, including contour intervals of no more than five feet based on field surveys or photogrammetric methods. 
                  C.  The existing and proposed land uses and the approximate location of all buildings and structures. 
                  D.  The approximate location of existing and proposed streets. 
                  E.  The approximate location of all existing and proposed utilities, including a preliminary utility and drainage plan. 
                  F.  The present zoning pattern in the area. 
                  G.  A legal description of the subject property. 
                  H.  The location and use of existing and proposed public, semipublic, and community facilities such as schools, parks, and open areas on the site. This includes areas proposed to be dedicated or reserved for community or public use. 
                  I.  Perspective drawings of representative building types; however, this is not required for single-family detached dwellings. 
                  2.  If a proposed development creates special problems or involves unusual circumstances, additional information may be required in order to properly evaluate the proposal as follows: 
                  A.  An off-street parking and loading plan. 
                  B.  An economic feasibility report or market analysis. 
                  C.  A traffic study of the area, and a circulation plan within the proposed development as well as to and from existing streets adjacent to the site. 
                  3.  The written summary of intent submitted with the development plan must include the following information: 
                  A.  A statement of the present ownership of all land within the proposed development. 
                  B.  An explanation of the character of the proposed development; this includes a summary of acres, number and types of dwelling units, and gross density by type of land use. 
                  C.  A general statement of the proposed development schedule. 
                  D.  Agreements, provisions, and covenants which govern the use, maintenance and protection of the development and any common or open areas. 
                  c)  Review and approval of PM [district] application. 
                  1.  An application for approval of a PM [district] is treated administratively as an application for an amendment to this ordinance (rezoning). This is because PM districts are created only upon request of a developer, whose application materials demonstrate a firm commitment to construction of a well-designed PM [district]. Upon approval of the PM [district], existing zoning must be changed to a PM zone, which is an amendment to the ordinance. The amendment procedures contained in article VII must be followed in granting the amendment to permit the PM [district]. 
                  2.  The zoning administrative officer will turn over the application materials to the planning commission for its recommendation. The planning commission will thoroughly study the materials and make written recommendations to the mayor and city council stating the reasons for its recommendations (according to procedures contained in article VII). 
                  3.  The power to approve an amendment creating a PM district rests with the mayor and city council. After conducting the public hearing and considering recommendations from the planning commission (section 7.6(d)), the mayor and city council will then make an official decision on the proposed PM [district]. The mayor and city council may approve, disapprove, or conditionally approve the development plan. 
                  4.  If the development plan is approved as submitted, the official map will be changed to indicate [the] PM district. If the plan is approved with modifications, the applicant must file with the zoning administrator the following: 
                  A.  Written notice of consent to the modifications. 
                  B.  A properly revised site plan. 
                  5.  The official map will then be changed. The site plan and supporting information of any approved plan will be properly identified and permanently filed with the planning commission. 
                  6.  No building permits will be issued by the building inspector until the development plan has been approved by the mayor and city council. 
                  d)  Issuance of building permits. The building inspector will issue building permits for building and structure in the area covered by the approved development plan if the proposed buildings and structures are in conformity with the approved development plan, the development schedule, and all other applicable regulations. 
                  e)  Revision of development plan after approval of plan. 
                  1.  Minor extensions, alterations, or modifications of existing buildings or structure may be permitted after review and approval by the zoning administrator; such changes must be consistent with the purpose and intent of the development plan. A request for a revision of the development plan must be supported by a written statement indicating the nature of the revision and the reasons it is considered necessary or desirable to revise the development. 
                  2.  Any major or substantial change in the approved development plan which affects the intent and character of the development, the density of land use patterns, the location or dimensions of streets, or singular substantial changes must be reviewed and approved by the mayor and city council after receipt of recommendations from the planning commission. A request for a revision of the development plan must be supported by a written statement indicating the nature of the revision and the reasons it is considered necessary or desirable to revise the development. 
                  f)  Approval of PM [district] revoked if construction not begun. Construction of the planned development must begin within one year of the approval of the PM [district]. If no construction has begun by then, or if the applicant fails to maintain the approved development schedule, approval of the development plan will lapse. At its discretion and for good cause, the mayor and city council may extend the period for beginning construction of any phase of the project for one additional year. If approval of the development plan lapses under this provision, the subject PM district will be removed from the official map, and the zoning districts and regulations which were in effect prior to the approval of the development plan will be reinstated. 
                  Sec. 23.5. - Development standards for PM districts. 
                  In addition to the development standards contained in article IV of this ordinance, the following standards are required within PM districts: 
                  a)  Development plan. [The] approved development plan must be carried out. 
                  b)  [Denisity requirements.] Density requirements or dwelling units (du) per acre shall be determined by the planning commission and recommended to the city council for approval. The intent of density requirements for mixed use development is to allow higher densities along heavy traffic areas and roadways adjacent to more intense uses such as commercial or industrial development. The lesser density development requirements would be more compatible adjacent to single-family or other residential development. 
                  Dwelling units per acre allowed: 
                  Five dwelling units per acre 
                  Seven and one-half dwelling units per acre 
                  Ten dwelling units per acre 
                  Twelve dwelling units per acre 
                  c)  Deviation from required densities. 
                  1.  The mayor and city council may allow higher net or gross residential densities, as well as a higher density of a particular residential use, as long as the applicant can show that such a higher density will not be detrimental to the surrounding neighborhood. 
                  2.  The mayor and city council will consider a deviation from the specified maximum density only upon a favorable recommendation from the planning commission. 
                  d)  Dimensional and bulk regulations. The location of all proposed buildings and structures must be shown on the approved development plan; minimum lot sizes, setback lines, lot coverages, and floor areas shown on the development plan must be adhered to. The proposed location and arrangement of structures must not be detrimental to existing or proposed adjacent dwellings or to the development of [a] neighborhood. 
                  e)  Perimeter requirements. The mayor and city council, upon recommendation of the planning commission, may impose the following requirements to protect the privacy of existing adjoining uses: 
                  1.  Structures or buildings located at the perimeter of the PM [district] must be set back a distance of 30 to 50 feet from the boundary of the PM [district]. 
                  2.  Mixed use development shall have a minimum 30 percent of gross acreage set aside as open space and shall provide recreational areas within said open space. 
                  f)  Control of area after completion. After completion of a planned development, the use of land and the construction, modification, or alteration of any buildings or structures within the PM [district] must conform to the approved development plan. If community needs are found to be changing in the future and a revision of the approved development plan is thought to be needed, procedures outlined in the revision of the development plan after approval of plan must be followed. See section 23.4(e). 
                  g)  Sight distance. In order to ensure maintenance of adequate sight distances at intersections, no fence, wall, shrubbery, or other obstruction to vision between the heights of three feet and 15 feet above the ground is permitted within 20 feet of the intersection of the right-of-way of streets or of streets and railroads. 
                  h)  Applicability to land, buildings, and open space. No building, structure, land, or open space may be used or occupied and no building or structure or part of a building or structure may be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered unless in conformity with all of the regulations specified for the district in which it is located. 
                  i)  Every use must be on a lot. No building or structure may be erected or use established unless upon a lot as defined by this ordinance. 
                  j)  Open space not to be encroached upon. No open space may be encroached upon or reduced in any manner except in conformity with the yard, setback, off-street parking spaces, and other such required development standards contained in the ordinance. Shrubbery, driveways, retaining walls, fences, curbs, and buffers (see definition in article 2) are not considered to be encroachments of yards. Open space areas as required by this ordinance must be permanently maintained as open space in accordance with the requirements of this ordinance. 
                  k)  Reduction of yards or lot area. Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, a lot existing at the time of passage of this ordinance may not be reduced, divided, or changed so as to produce a tract of land which does not comply with the minimum dimension or area requirements of this ordinance for the district in which it is located unless that reduction or division is necessary to provide land which is needed and accepted for public use. 
                  l)  Lots with multiple frontage. In case of a corner lot or double frontage lot, front yard setback requirements apply to all lot lines abutting a street. 
                  m)  Landlocked lots. Landlocked lots are not eligible for placement within a PM zoning district. 
                  n)  Yards and other spaces. No part of a yard, other open space, off-street parking, or loading space required for one building may be included as a part of the yard, off-street parking, or loading space required for another building, except as specifically provided for in this ordinance. 
                  o)  Substandard lots. Substandard lots are not eligible for placement within a PM zoning district. 
                  p)  Encroachment on public rights-of-way. No building, structure, service area, required off-street parking, or loading/unloading facility is permitted to encroach on public rights-of-way. 
                  q)  Physical design standards. Minimum design standards loading areas, and other such physical site improvements in applicable development regulations of this ordinance. Consult the zoning administrator for specific requirements. 
                  r)  Off-street parking and service requirements. Minimum standards for off-street parking and service requirements are contained in this ordinance. Consult the zoning administrator for specific requirements. 
                  s)  Other applicable development regulations. Information concerning any other applicable development regulations may be obtained from the zoning administrator. 
                  t)  Signs. Minimum design and location standards for signs are contained in the Fort Oglethorpe sign ordinance. Consult that document for specific requirements. 
                  u)  Development standards shown in approved development plan. Other development standards shown in an approved development plan apply only to the development shown on the specific development plan. Such development standards must be maintained. 
                  v)  Design standards for all PM [district] developments. 
                  1.  General. Condition of soil, groundwater level, drainage, and ground slope must not create hazards to the property, or to the health or safety of residents. The site must not be exposed to objectionable smoke, noise, odors, or other adverse conditions; and no part subject to flooding or erosion can be used for any purpose that would expose people or property to danger. 
                  2.  Soil and ground cover. Exposed ground surfaces throughout the development must be protected with a vegetative growth that prevents soil erosion, standing puddles, and dust. If this is not possible, such areas may be covered with a solid material such as stone, or may be paved. 
                  3.  Site drainage. The ground surfaces throughout the development must be equipped to drain all surface water in a safe, efficient manner, either through grading or installation of drains. 
                  4.  Required buffer. A buffer (see section 4.10) is required along all lot lines of the development. This is in addition to common open space.

                  ARTICLE XXVI. - STREETSCAPE REGULATION 

                  Sec. 26.1. - Preamble. 
                  (a)  Natural, scenic and historic landscapes are closely tied to the quality of life, community identity, and civic values of the city. These landscapes also play a significant role in the critical first impressions of potential new employers, homeowners, tourists and other visitors, thus affecting the economy of our city. 
                  (b)  A respect and appreciation for natural green spaces from our stream courses and wooded ridges to neighborhood parks and street trees is evident among our residential and business communities alike. It is increasingly important to improve the quality and character of commercial, retail, office, and industrial areas to ensure economic vitality in the future. 
                  (c)  Landscaping provides important environmental benefits such as reducing air pollution and stormwater run-off, improving water quality, and creating wildlife habitat. Citizens feel strongly about protecting the things they value and personal mobility is among those values. Pedestrian-friendly streets require such things as sidewalks, appropriately sized, placed and spaced trees, adequate lighting and other amenities such as benches, shelters and trash receptacles. Streetscaping and landscaping requirements serve as a tool for improving the convenience and aesthetics of personal mobility and protecting and enhancing the natural, scenic and historic character of our community. 
                  (d)  In the interest of these broader community concerns, the purpose and intent of this article is as follows: 
                  (1)  To promote the natural, scenic and historic character of the community; 
                  (2)  To improve the appearance of prominent thoroughfares, parking areas and property abutting public rights-of-way; 
                  (3)  To protect property values; 
                  (4)  To reduce stormwater runoff and improve water quality; 
                  (5)  To provide for suitable transition between incompatible land uses; and 
                  (6)  To provide relief from traffic, noise, heat, glare, dust, and debris.

                  (Ord. No. 2000-18, § 2, 8-28-00) 
                  Sec. 26.6. - Screening requirements. 
                  (a)  Intent. To provide transition between incompatible land uses and to protect the integrity of less-intensive uses from more intensive uses, screening and buffering will be required. The purpose of the screen is to provide a year-round visual obstruction. The buffer provides transition between the incompatible uses by requiring a landscape yard of a minimum specified depth along the shared property line. 
                  (b)  Procedure. Refer to the matrix attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference to determine any screening requirements for the proposed development. First, identify the type of zoning for the proposed development (in the left hand column of the matrix) and each adjoining property (along the top of the matrix). Find where the zoning of the proposed development and each adjoining property intersect on the matrix. If a screen is required, a capital letter will indicate the type of screen to be applied. A description of each screen type is provided herein. 
                  When classifying a zoning district for the screen matrix, it the proposed use within a zone is also listed as a permitted use within a less-intensive zone, the corresponding class for the less-intensive zone may be applied. For example, a proposed commercial use within a manufacturing zone may be classified as a commercial zone for the purpose of using the screening matrix. 
                  (c)  Screen matrix.

                  Sec. 26.10. - Scenic heritage large-specimen tree protection. 
                  (a)  Intent. The presence in and around the city, both within the historic district and elsewhere, of historic, large-specimen canopy trees represents a valuable resource to the city and its citizens. Appropriate levels of protection will preserve this resource for future generations. The protection of such trees located on city-owned property and rights-of-way can be addressed more simply than can be readily applied to those on private property or public property that is not city-owned. The intent of this section is to provide for a mechanism to monitor, maintain, preserve and protect large specimen trees located on both privately owned, city-owned and other public agency-owned property located within and adjacent to the boundaries of the city. 
                  (b)  Designation criteria for scenic heritage trees. 
                  (1)  To be classified as a city-protected tree, an individual tree must be registered as a "scenic heritage large-specimen tree" by the city council. 
                  a.  City-owned and protected trees shall be registered by number, located on a city-maintained map and database, designated "protected-city", assigned an "active" status and regularly monitored, maintained, preserved and protected by the city. 
                  b.  Publicly owned and city-protected trees shall be so designated by mutual agreement of both the city and the affected public agency owner of the property on which the subject tree is located. Such trees shall be registered by number, located on a city-maintained map and database, designated "protected-public", assigned an "active" status and regularly monitored, maintained, preserved and protected by the city. 
                  c.  Privately owned and city-protected trees shall be so designated by mutual agreement of both the city and the affected private property owner. Such trees shall be registered by number, located on a city-maintained map and database, designated "protected-private", assigned an "active" status and regularly monitored, maintained, preserved and protected by the city. 
                  d.  Jointly-owned and city-protected trees shall be so designated by mutual agreement of both the city and all affected property owners. Such trees shall be registered by number, located on a city-maintained map and database, designated "protected-joint", assigned an "active" status and regularly monitored, maintained, preserved and protected by the city. 
                  e.  Registration of an individual tree as either a city owned and protected, publicly owned and city-protected or privately owned and city-protected tree is intended to result in the perpetual maintenance, preservation and protection of that tree by the city until it is removed by the city, if ever. 
                  f.  Removal of a city-protected tree may only be done by city-authorization. Such authorization must be accompanied by a certified justification for such removal. Among the certifiable justifications for the removal of a protected tree are such things as protection of life, limb and property, necessary displacement for city services, irreversibly poor and declining health of the subject tree and etc. 
                  g.  Any unauthorized defacing, damaging, destruction or removal of a city-protected tree (including, but not limited to excavation, filling, paving or otherwise disturbing the affected root area of the subject tree) shall be considered as damage to city property and may result in fines and other punishments accorded such activity. 
                  h.  Although a city-protected tree may be removed, the registration number and location of the previously protected tree shall be maintained on the city map and database with its status re-assigned as "removed". 
                  i.  Whenever a city-protected tree has been removed, no continuing restrictions or responsibilities under this article will accompany the site where the protected tree once stood. 
                  (2)  City-owned scenic heritage large-specimen tree: 
                  a.  Any large-specimen tree on city property or right-of-way is classified as a city-owned and protected tree. 
                  b.  Any large-specimen tree on private or other property whose trunk is determined to be at least partially on city property or right-of-way is classified as a city owned and protected tree. 
                  (3)  Publicly-owned scenic heritage large-specimen trees: 
                  a.  Any large-specimen tree whose-trunk is located entirely on property owned by a public agency (other than the city) within the city limits and is highly visible from any adjacent city property or right-of-way is eligible to be listed locally as a publicly owned and city-protected tree. 
                  b.  Any large-specimen tree whose trunk is located entirely on property outside the city limits owned by a public agency (other than the city) but is highly visible from adjacent city property or right-of-way is eligible to be listed locally as a privately owned and city-protected tree by means of a city conservation easement. 
                  (4)  Privately-owned scenic heritage large-specimen trees: 
                  a.  Any large-specimen tree whose trunk is located entirely on private property within the city limits and is highly visible from any adjacent city property or right-of-way is eligible to be listed locally as a privately owned and city-protected tree. 
                  b.  Any large-specimen tree whose trunk is located entirely on private property outside the city limits and is highly visible from any adjacent city property or right-of-way is eligible to be listed locally as a privately owned and city-protected tree by means of a city conservation easement. 
                  (5)  Jointly owned scenic heritage large-specimen trees: 
                  Any large-specimen tree whose trunk is located on more than one piece of public or private property and not also partially located on either city property or city right-of-way shall require the mutual consent of all affected property owners to be registered as a city-protected tree. 
                  (c)  Special provisions. 
                  (1)  Presence of a city-protected tree on any property affected by either the streetscaping or landscaping section of this article shall be exempted from provisions of those sections as follows: 
                  a.  Streetscaping - Fifty linear feet of frontage will be subtracted from streetscaping enhancement assessment calculations for each city-protected tree. 
                  b.  Landscaping - An area equivalent to 2,000 square feet will be subtracted from the street yard or landscape yard requirements of a property for each city protected tree. 
                  (2)  Presence of a city-protected tree on any property affected by a stormwater fee (whenever one is required) shall be eligible to receive a stormwater credit toward the amount normally assessed against the subject property. This credit is in addition to the landscaping, screening and buffer credit addressed elsewhere in this article. The actual credit amount is subject to the review and approval of the building inspector. A maximum stormwater fee reduction of 25 percent is available subject to the review and approval of the building inspector. 
                  (d)  Exceptions. 
                  (1)  Any registered city-protected tree can have its protected status suspended by mutual agreement of both the city and the affected property owner(s) of the tree (if other than the city). 
                  (2)  Although a registered city-protected tree may have its protected status released, the registration number and location of the previously protected tree shall be maintained on the city map and database and its status shall be re-assigned as "released". 
                  (3)  When the protected status of a registered city-protected tree has been released, no continuing restrictions or responsibilities under this article will accompany the previously protected tree. 
                  (Ord. No. 2000-18, § 2, 8-28-00) 
                  Sec. 26.11. - Certificate of occupancy/bonding. 
                  (a)  If the landscaping has not been installed and inspected for proper installation prior to receiving a certificate of occupancy, a certificate of occupancy may be granted provided the following conditions are met. 
                  (1)  Property owner posts a performance bond or irrevocable letter of credit with the city treasurer; 
                  (2)  The amount of the bond or letter of credit shall be based on material and installation costs of the uninstalled landscape material, including a 20 percent contingency cost, as shown on the submitted landscape plan; and 
                  (3)  The costs of the landscaping shall be certified by a licensed contractor or determined using a general formula established by the landscape site plan reviewer (option of applicant). 
                  (b)  After receiving the certificate of occupancy, the remaining landscape material shall be installed within six months. The bond or letter of credit shall be called if the required landscaping has not been installed by the end of the six month period and the funds applied to complete the landscaping work.
