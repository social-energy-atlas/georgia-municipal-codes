PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of Heard County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were ordinances adopted by the Board of Commissioners through September 11, 2007. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments

The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any Code section, whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition to the penalty above, the County may pursue other remedies including, but not limited to, abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief and revocation of licenses or permits. 
                  Section 5. Additions or amendments to the Code when passed in such form as to indicate the intention of the County to make the same a part of the Code shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments.

Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code Book and are considered "Omitted." 
                  In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

               Editor's note— Part I contains selected state laws of local application as requested by the county.

For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. The title, enactment, severability, repealer, transitional, ratification, publication and effective date provisions have been omitted, and where a section has been amended or repealed by a later provision, only the current language has been printed. Unless otherwise noted, article headings, titles and section catchlines have been supplied by the editor. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. Formal citations should be to the original act and not to this compilation.

Any resolution passed by the board regarding the date, time, and place of its monthly meeting shall be published in the official county organ once a week for two weeks during a period of 30 days immediately following the passage of the resolution. The board of commissioners may hold such additional meetings as shall be necessary when called by the county chairman or any three district commissioners, provided all members of the commission shall have been notified at least three days in advance of such special meeting which also shall be open to the public. Any four district commissioners or the county chairman and any three district commissioners shall constitute a quorum. No official action shall be taken except upon the affirmative vote of at least three district commissioners and except upon compliance with Chapter 14 of Title 50 of the O.C.G.A. (O.C.G.A. title 50, ch. 14), relating to open meetings. All regular and called meetings shall be conducted according to Robert's Rules of Order.

If the authority shall deem it expedient to construct any project on any other lands the title to which shall then be in the State of Georgia, the Governor is authorized to convey, for and in behalf of the state, title to such lands to the authority upon payment of the reasonable value of such lands to the appropriate state officer or department for the credit of the general fund of the state. Such value shall be determined by three appraisers to be agreed upon by the Governor and the chairman of the authority;

               (5)	To make contracts and leases and to execute all instruments necessary or convenient, including contracts for construction or projects and leases of projects or contracts with respect to the use of projects which it causes to be erected or acquired. Any and all persons, firms, and corporations and any and all political subdivisions, departments, institutions, or agencies of the state are authorized to enter into contracts, leases, or agreements with the authority upon such terms and for such purposes as they deem advisable. Without limiting the generality of the above, authority is specifically granted to municipal corporations, counties, and to the authority to enter into contracts, lease agreements, or other undertakings relative to the furnishing of water and related services and facilities by the authority to such municipal corporations and counties or for the purchase of water by the authority therefrom for a term not exceeding 50 years; 
               (6)	To construct, erect, acquire, own, repair, remodel, maintain, add to, extend, improve, equip, operate, and manage projects, as defined in this Act, the cost of any such project to be paid in whole or in part from the proceeds of revenue bonds of the authority or from such proceeds and any grant or grants from the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof;

               (10)	To do all things necessary or convenient to carry out the powers expressly given in this Act. 
               Section 5. - Revenue bonds—Generally. 
               The authority, or any authority or body which has or which may in the future succeed to the powers, duties, and liabilities vested in the authority created in this Act, shall have the power and is authorized at one time, or from time to time, to provide by resolution for the issuance of negotiable revenue bonds of the authority for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost as herein defined of any one or more projects. The principal and interest of such revenue bonds shall be payable solely from the special fund provided for such payment. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates as permitted by resolution of the authority, and shall mature at such time or times not exceeding 40 years from their date or dates or at such times exceeding 40 years as may hereafter be authorized by the bonding laws of the State of Georgia. The bonds shall be payable in such medium of payment as to both principal and interest as may be determined by the authority and may be redeemable before maturity, at the option of the authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority in the resolution for the issuance of bonds. 
               (1986 Ga. Laws (Act No. 1357), § 2, p. 5367) 
               Section 6. - Same—Form; denominations; registration; place of payment.

The bonds may be issued in coupon or registered form, or both, as the authority may determine. Provisions may be made for the registration of any coupon bond as to principal alone and also as to both the principal and interest. 
               Section 7. - Same—Signatures; seal. 
               In case any officer whose signature shall appear on any bonds, or whose facsimile signature shall appear on any coupon, shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. All such bonds shall be signed by the chairman of the authority and the official seal of the authority shall be affixed thereto and attached by the secretary of the authority and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the signature or facsimile signature of the chairman of the authority. Any coupon may bear the facsimile signature of such persons and any bond may be signed, sealed, and attested on behalf of the authority by such persons as at the actual time of the execution of such bonds shall be duly authorized or hold the proper office, although at the date of such bonds such persons may not have been so authorized or shall not have held such office. 
               Section 8. - Same—Negotiability; exemption from taxation. 
               All revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall have and are declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the negotiable instrument laws of this state.

               Section 9. - Same—Sale; price. 
               The authority may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interests of the authority.

               Section 10. - Same—Proceeds of bonds. 
               The proceeds of such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project or projects, and unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds, or in the trust indenture, additional bonds may in like manner be issued, to provide the amount of any deficit, which, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds, or in the trust indenture, shall be deemed to be of the same, and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund, without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purpose. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such bonds are issued, the surplus shall be paid into the fund, as provided in this Act, for the payment of principal and interest of such bonds. 
               Section 11. - Same—Interim receipts and certificates of temporary bonds. 
               Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts, interim certificates, or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter. 
               Section 12. - Same—Replacement of lost or mutilated bonds.

               Such revenue bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any conditions or things other than those proceedings, conditions, and things which are specified or required by this Act. In the discretion of the authority, revenue bonds of a single issue may be issued for the purpose of any particular project. Any resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this Act shall become effective immediately upon its passage and shall be published in the official newspaper for Heard County one time within a week of its being adopted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special meeting of the authority by a majority of its members. 
               Section 14. - Same—Credit not pledged. 
               Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of Heard County or the City of Franklin or a pledge of the faith and credit of said county or city, but such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund as provided in this Act, and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate said county or city to levy or to pledge any form of taxation therefor, or to make any appropriation for the payment, and all such bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this section. 
               Section 15. - Same—Trust indenture as security. 
               In the discretion of the authority, any issuance of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues, and earnings to be received by the authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property; the construction of the project; the maintenance, operation, repair, and insurance of the project; and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the project affected by such indenture. 
               Section 16. - Same—To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid. 
               The authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who, or any agency, bank or trust company which, shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as this Act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide. 
               Section 17. - Same—Sinking funds. 
               The revenues, fees, tolls, and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such have been issued, unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the authority to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds of the authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust instrument may provide, and such funds not pledged, from whatever source received, which said pledge may include funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture, into a sinking fund, which said sinking fund shall be pledged to and charged with the payments of: 
               (1)	The interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due;
               (2)	The principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due;
               (3)	The necessary charges of paying agents for paying principal and interest; and
               (4)	Any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as hereinabove provided.
               The use and disposition of such sinking funds shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be a fund for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, surplus moneys in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be canceled and shall not again be issued. 
               Section 18. - Same—Remedies of bondholders. 
               Any holder of revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by bringing an action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Georgia, or granted hereunder, or under such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this Act or by such resolution or trust indenture to be performed by the authority, or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished. 
               Section 19. - Same—Refunding bonds. 
               The authority is authorized to provide by resolution for the issue of revenue refunding bonds of the authority for the purpose of refunding any revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act and then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon. The issuance of such revenue refunding bonds, the maturities and all other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof, and the duties of the authority in respect to the same shall be governed by the foregoing provisions of this Act insofar as the same may be applicable. 
               Section 20. - Same—Venue and jurisdiction. 
               Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this Act or any action against such authority shall be brought in the Superior Court of Heard County, Georgia, and any action pertaining to validation of any bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall likewise be brought in said court which shall have exclusive, original jurisdiction of such actions. 
               Section 21. - Same—Validation. 
               Bonds of the authority shall be confirmed and validated in accordance with the procedures of Article 3 of Chapter 82 of Title 36 of the O.C.G.A. (O.C.G.A. § 36-82-60 et seq.), known as the Revenue Bond Law, as amended. The petition for validation shall also make party defendant to such action any municipality, county, authority, subdivision, or instrumentality of the State of Georgia which has contracted with the authority for services and facilities of the water system for which bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated, and such municipality, county, authority, subdivision, or instrumentality shall be required to show cause, if any, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the court and the validity of the terms thereof be determined and the contract or contracts adjudicated as security for the payment of any such bonds of the authority. The bonds, when validated, and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds, against the authority issuing the same, and any municipality, county, authority, subdivision, or instrumentality contracting with the said Franklin-Heard County Water Authority. 
               Section 22. - Same—Interest of bondholders protected. 
               While any of the bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties of existence of said authority, or of its officers, employees, or agents, shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of such bonds; and no other entity, department, agency, or authority will be created which will compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the rights and interests of the holders of such bonds nor will the state itself so compete with the authority. The provisions of this Act shall be for the benefit of the authority and the holders of any such bonds, and upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions hereof, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds. 
               Section 23. - Moneys received considered trust funds. 
               All moneys received pursuant to the authority of this Act, whether all proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds, as grants or other contributions, or as revenues, fees, and earnings, shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided in this Act. 
               Section 24. - Purpose of the authority. 
               (a)	Without limiting the generality of any provisions of this Act, the general purpose of the authority is declared to be that of acquiring an adequate source or sources of water supply, treatment of such water, and, thereafter, the distribution of same to the various townships and citizens in Heard County and environs, including adjoining counties and municipalities located therein, but such general purpose shall not restrict the authority from selling and delivering water direct to consumers in those areas where there does not exist water distribution systems to such consumers and areas where neither any county nor municipality deems it desirable or feasible to furnish water in such locality. 
               (b)	The authority shall also have authority, where it deems it feasible, to sell its products and services to consumers, governmental agencies, or governmental instrumentalities of adjoining states, provided the laws of the adjoining states do not prohibit or tax said activity. 
               (c)	The authority shall not have the authority to construct water lines for the distribution of water directly to consumers within any water district or municipality without first obtaining the express written consent of the appropriate governing bodies of such water districts or municipalities.

               Section 26. - Rules and regulations for operation of projects. 
               It shall be the duty of the authority to prescribe rules and regulations for the operation of the project or projects constructed under the provisions of this Act, including the basis on which water service and facilities shall be furnished.

               The foregoing sections of this Act shall be deemed to provide an additional and alternative method for the doing of the things authorized in this Act and shall be regarded as supplemental and additional to powers conferred by other laws and shall not be regarded as in derogation of any powers now existing. 
               Section 28. - Liberal construction of Act. 
               This Act being for the welfare of various political subdivisions of the state and its inhabitants shall be liberally construed to effect the purposes thereof. 
               Section 29. - Severability. 
               In the event any section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase of this Act shall be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional, such adjudication shall in no manner affect the other sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, or phrases of this Act, which shall remain of full force and effect as if the section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase so declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional were not originally a part hereof. The General Assembly declares that it would have passed the remaining parts of this Act if it had known that such part or parts hereof would be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional. 
               Section 30. - Effect on other governments. 
               This Act does not in any way take from Heard County or the City of Franklin the authority to own, operate, and maintain water systems or issue revenue certificates as is provided by Article 3 of Chapter 82 of Title 36 of the O.C.G.A. (O.C.G.A. § 36-82-60 et seq.), known as the Revenue Bond Law.

                  (c)	Plans. When the building official issues a permit, he shall endorse, in writing or by stamp, both sets of plans "reviewed for code compliance." One set of drawings so reviewed shall be retained by the building official and the other set shall be returned to the applicant. The permitted drawings shall be kept at the site of work and shall be open to inspection by the building official or his authorized representative. 
                  Sec. 8-67. - Fees. 
                  (a)	Payment. A permit shall not be issued until the fees prescribed hereby have been paid, nor shall an amendment to a permit be released until the additional fee, if any, due to an increase in the estimated cost of the building, structure, electrical, plumbing, mechanical or gas systems, has been paid. 
                  (b)	Penalty fee for work started before permit issuance. Any person who commences any work on a building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system before obtaining the necessary permits, shall be subject to a penalty of 100 percent of the usual permit fee in addition to the required permit fees. 
                  (c)	Accounting. The building official shall keep a permanent and accurate accounting of all permit fees and other monies collected, the names of all persons upon whose account the same was paid, along with the date and amount thereof.

                  (f)	Building permit valuations. If, in the opinion of the building official, the valuation of building, alteration, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing systems appears to be underestimated on the application, the permit shall be denied, unless the applicant can show detailed estimates to meet the approval of the building official. Permit valuations shall include the total cost, such as electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing equipment and other systems, including the materials and labor. 
                  Sec. 8-68. - Temporary mobile dwelling living quarters. 
                  (a)	A temporary mobile living quarter, including, but not limited to, a recreational vehicle (RV), camper, vehicle converted to a camper and other similar camping accommodation, may be permitted to be used as a temporary residence where the occupant has obtained a building permit for the construction of his or her personal residence.

                  (1)	Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(2) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued the Georgia Water Quality Control Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f)). As used in this subsection, the terms, "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed to control soil erosion and sedimentation for all rainfall events up to and including a 25-year, 24-hour rainfall event. 
                  (2)	A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or by the division or of any general permit for construction activities issued by the division pursuant to the Georgia Water Quality Control Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f)), for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. 
                  (3)	Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or by the division or any general permit for construction activities issued by the division pursuant to the Georgia Water Quality Control Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f)), for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)	The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from which land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (c)	The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this chapter for the purpose of governing land disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the state soil and water conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)	Stripping of vegetation, regarding and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)	Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
                  (3)	Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
                  (4)	Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
                  (5)	The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)	Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
                  (7)	Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)	Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)	To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)	Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills;

The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.	No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed; 
                  b.	Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; 
                  provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; and 
                  (16)	There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to the Georgia Water Quality Control Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 et seq.), except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.	No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. 
                  b.	Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed. 
                  (d)	Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent an issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in section 14-22(b) and (c). 
                  (e)	The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this chapter or the terms of the permit.

The suspension, revocation, modification or grant with condition of a permit by the issuing authority, upon finding that the holder is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sediment control plan, or that the holder is in violation of any chapter, shall entitle the person submitting the plan or holding the permit to a hearing before the county board of commissioners within 15 days after receipt by the issuing authority of written notice of appeal. 
                  (b)	Judicial review. Any person, aggrieved by a decision or order of the issuing authority, after exhausting his administrative remedies, shall have the right to appeal de novo to the superior court of the county. 
                  (c)	Liability. Compliance to the provisions of this chapter do not negate liability as follows: 
                  (1)	Neither the approval of a plan under the provisions of this chapter, nor the compliance with provisions of this article shall relieve any person from the responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by law nor impose any liability upon the issuing authority or district for damage to any person or property. 
                  (2)	The fact that a land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this chapter or the terms of the permit. 
                  (3)	No provision of this chapter shall permit any persons to violate the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq., the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq., or the rules and regulations promulgated and approved thereunder or pollute any waters of the state as defined thereby.

                  Sec. 18-3. - Statutory authorization. 
                  The legislature of the state has, in O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a), delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. 
                  (Ord. No. 50-400, art. 1, § A, 12-12-1995) 
                  Sec. 18-4. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)	The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditure for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)	These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. No. 50-400, art. 1, § B, 12-12-1995) 
                  Sec. 18-5. - Purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)	Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)	Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
                  (4)	Control fillings, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; and 
                  (5)	Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

                  Sec. 18-69. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data have been provided, as set forth in section 18-8, 18-47(2) or 18-70, the following provisions are required. 
                  (1)	Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection (4) of this section. 
                  (2)	Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or nonresidential structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Structures located in AE or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation, plus one foot, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, are designed to be watertight, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability or resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions in this subsection, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth in this subsection and in section 18-47(5). 
                  (3)	Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways. Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 18-8, where streams exist but no base flood data have provided (A-zones from FIRM maps), or where base flood data have been provided without floodway, the following provisions apply: 
                  a.	When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 18-8, then the county zoning administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this article. If data are not available from these sources, then subsections (3)b and c of this section shall apply. 
                  b.	No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  c.	In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. The county zoning administrator shall record the lowest flood elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (4)	New construction or substantial improvements. Elevated buildings new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the base flood elevation formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
                  a.	Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.	Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.	The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and
                  3.	Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction. 
                  b.	So as not to violate the lowest floor criteria of this chapter, the unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure shall only be use for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.	The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)	Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. 
                  a.	All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on individual lots or parcels, in new or substantially improved manufactured home park or subdivisions, in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or on a site in an existing manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one feet above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.	Manufactured placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.	The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.	The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.	All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to the adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement, in accordance with section 18-68(5). 
                  d.	All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
                  1.	Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect-type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  2.	The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (5)a and c of this section. 
                  (6)	Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 18-8, are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.	Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer shall provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.	Only if subsection (6)a of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvements shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article.

                  ARTICLE IV. - VARIANCE PROCEDURES 

                  Sec. 18-99. - Variances; appeal. 
                  (a)	The planning commission, as established by the county zoning chapter, shall hear and decide appeals or requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (b)	The planning commission shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the county zoning administrator in the, enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
                  (c)	Any person aggrieved by the decision of the planning commission may appeal such decision to the county superior court, as provided in state statute. 
                  (d)	Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)	Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)	Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)	In reviewing such requests, the board of zoning appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
                  (h)	Conditions for variances.
                  (1)	A variance shall be issued only when there is:
                  a.	A finding of good and sufficient cause;
                  b.	A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.	A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)	The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)	The county zoning administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)	Upon consideration of the factors listed in subsection (h) of this section and the purpose of this article, the planning commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  (c)	The following minimum standards shall be met unless directed otherwise by the county public works department or the county code enforcement officer, or their designated agent:

                  (2)	Said bond(s) or letter(s) of credit shall be valid only for the calendar year in which it is issued, but may be transferred from one timber harvesting operation, once completed, to another. 
                  (3)	Timber harvester shall submit the fully completed notice of timber harvesting activity form along with all requested additional information and surety bond(s) or bank letter of credit(s) to the building and zoning department, which then shall review the documentation submitted and notify the timber harvester of approval or denial to proceed with the timber harvesting process. 
                  (f)	Once approval is granted, the timber harvester shall post a copy of the approval to proceed in clear view from the road at the previously inspected and approved ingress/egress point and maintain display until the timber harvesting activity is completed. 
                  (g)	Surety bond(s) or letter of credit(s) shall not be released or transferred to another location until a final inspection has been conducted by the road department and a copy of said release is provided to the building and zoning department.

                  All procedures shall be followed in order to have temporary right-of-way access. Failure to do so could result in Heard County revoking temporary access and/or inhibit release of bond(s) until all requirements are met.

All bonds and bond anticipation notes issued by an authority shall be revenue obligations of such authority and may be made payable out of any revenues or other receipts, funds, or moneys of the authority, subject only to any agreements with the holders of other bonds or bond anticipation notes or to particular security agreements pledging any particular revenues, receipts, funds, or moneys. 
                  (e)	Prior pledges of security agreements. Issuance by an authority of one or more series of bonds or bond anticipation notes for one or more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds or notes in connection with the same project or with any other projects, but the proceeding wherein any subsequent bonds or bond anticipation notes shall be issued shall recognize and protect any prior pledge or mortgage made in any prior security agreement or made for any prior issue of bonds or bond anticipation notes, unless in the resolution authorizing such prior issue the right is expressly reserved to the authority to issue subsequent bonds or bond anticipation notes on a parity with such prior issue.

The authority may issue notes only to provide funds which would otherwise be provided by the issuance of the bonds as validated. The notes may be authorized, sold, executed, and delivered in the same manner as bonds. As with its bonds, the authority may sell such notes at public or private sale. Any resolution authorizing notes of the authority or any issue thereof may contain any provisions which the authority is authorized to include in any such resolution; and the authority may include in any notes any terms, covenants, or conditions which it is authorized to include in any bonds. Validation of such bonds shall be a condition precedent to the issuance of the notes, but it shall not be required that such notes be judicially validated. Bond anticipation notes shall not be issued in an amount exceeding the par value of the bonds in anticipation of which they are to be issued. 
                  (g)	Fixed rates for bonds. The interest rate on or rates to be borne by any bonds, notes, or other obligations issued by the authority shall be fixed by the board of directors of the authority. Any limitations with respect to interest rates found in O.C.G.A. title 36, ch. 82, art. 3 or in the usury laws of this state shall not apply to obligations issued under this part. 
                  (h)	Exceptions. All revenue bonds issued by an authority under this part will be issued and validated under and in accordance with O.C.G.A. title 36, ch. 82, art. 3, except as provided in subsection (f) of this section and except as specifically set forth as follows: 
                  (1)	Revenue bonds issued by an authority may be in such form, either coupon or fully registered, or both coupon and fully registered, and may be subject to such exchangeability and transferability provisions as the bond resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or any indenture or trust agreement may provide; 
                  (2)	Revenue bonds shall bear a certificate of validation. The signature of the clerk of the superior court of the judicial circuit in which the issuing authority is located may be made on the certificate of validation of such bonds by facsimile or by manual execution, stating the date on which such bonds were validated; and such entry shall be original evidence of the fact of judgment and shall be received as original evidence in any court in this state; and 
                  (3)	In lieu of specifying the rate of interest which revenue bonds to be issued by an authority are to bear, the note to the district attorney or the attorney general and the notice to the public of the time, place, and date of the validation hearing may state that the bonds, when issued, will bear interest at a rate not exceeding a maximum per annum rate of interest specified in such notices or, in the event the bonds are to bear different rates of interest for different maturity dates, that none of such rates will exceed the maximum rate specified in the notices; provided, however, that nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed as prohibiting or restricting the right of the authority to sell such bonds at a discount, even if in so doing the effective interest cost resulting therefrom would exceed the maximum per annum interest rate specified in such notices.

                  (a)	Purpose. The purpose of the preliminary plat is to safeguard the subdivider from unnecessary loss of time and expense in preparation of a subdivision plat which does not conform with the specifications of the subdivision regulations. The preliminary plat requires only approximate accuracy of scale and dimension. Public agencies (health department, county engineer or person designated by the commission chairperson, county commission, etc.) having jurisdiction will review preliminary plats regarding matters within their jurisdiction. During the review process, the subdivider or his agent may be called upon for consultation. 
                  (b)	Subdivisions requiring no new street, water, or sewer facilities. All subdivisions which do not involve the platting, construction, or opening of new streets, water or sewer facilities may be accepted by the planning commission in the form of a final plat, provided that essential data required by the reviewing agencies to insure compliance with the intent of these regulation is submitted. This essential data includes a proper soils inventory, a contour map and necessary percolation tests. 
                  (c)	Filing. Any person desiring to subdivide land shall file with the planning commission (through the county building and zoning office) five copies of the preliminary plat accompanied by a letter of application. The letter of application shall contain the name and address of the developer and his agent, the zoning of the property to be subdivided, whether or not the subdivision will be developed in phases, any plans for potential annexation and plans for serving the proposed subdivision with sewer and water facilities, or individual septic and water. The plat shall be prepared in accordance with these regulations and with applicable county specifications by a registered land surveyor, who is licensed under the laws of the state. The preliminary plat shall be deemed filed with the planning commission when it is filed with the building and zoning department. At the time of filing, a certificate of filing shall be provided to the subdivider and shall include the time and date of filing. The building and zoning department shall have the authority to reject the preliminary plat if he finds that it does not comply with these regulations. If the building and zoning department rejects the preliminary plat, he shall provide the subdivider with a written statement specifying all the aspects in which the plat fails to comply. The subdivider may appeal to the planning commission from such rejection. Filing of the preliminary plat shall be accomplished at least 14 days prior to the regular planning commission meeting at which it is to be considered. The preliminary plat shall include: 
                  (1)	Title block and north arrow. The plat will show the name of the proposed subdivision, its location, the name, address and registration number of the surveyor preparing the plat and the date of the plat. A north arrow shall be included with a notation referencing the bearings to magnetic north. 
                  (2)	General layout. The plat shall show information as to the proposed street layout and widths, layout of lots with a notation as to the minimum size and width of lots and any proposed open space. Any lands to be dedicated will be identified. Plat scale, total acreage of the site and total number of lots created shall also be indicated. Lot and block identification and building setback lines shall also be indicated. 
                  (3)	Topography. The plat shall show existing contour lines dashed and any proposed contour lines solid, both sets of lines to be at two-foot intervals, mean sea level (MSL). Prominent drainage features, such as, lakes, depressions, streams, etc., which could affect the design of the subdivision shall be shown. Engineering data showing the high-water elevation and how it was established shall be submitted. 
                  (4)	Existing features. The plat shall show the locations and names of existing and platted property lines, streets (and its right-of-way), railroads (and its right-of-way), public and private rights-of-way, sanitary sewer (and size), easements, storm drainage (and size), parks and other public open spaces, land lot and land district lines, city limits lines, if applicable and names of adjoining property owners or subdivisions. 
                  (5)	Location map. The plat shall include a small scale map of sufficient clarity so that the location of the proposed subdivision can be readily determined. 
                  (6)	Water and sewer. A statement from the subdivider shall be submitted with the preliminary plat which will describe the method by which sanitary sewer and water facilities will be provided. If a nonpublic sewer is proposed to serve a subdivision, then a soils inventory, soils percolation test results and contour map shall accompany the preliminary plat at the time of submission. The contour map shall show location and identification of each soil class and site of each percolation test. Percolation tests shall be made in accordance with county health department requirements. 
                  (7)	Future tract plan. In cases where a subdivision is to be developed in stages with additional plats being filed with the planning commission at a later date, the filing of the initial plat will be accompanied by a future tract plan, a reasonably accurate plat in sketch form of the entire tract which will show the future street system and topography for the entire tract. Once the required tract plan has been given approval by the planning commission, five copies of the approved future tract plan must be provided for distribution to the various reviewing agencies and the county building inspector. 
                  (d)	Completeness. If any of the facts in subsection (c) of this section are omitted or misrepresented on the plat, the chairperson may refuse to review the plat and shall return the plat to the subdivider to be completed or revised. 
                  (e)	Approval by individual agencies. No preliminary plat shall be approved by the planning commission unless it is approved by the county engineer or person designated by the commission chairperson, county commission or delegate and county health department. These agencies shall approve with or without modification or disapprove the preliminary plat to the extent that each has jurisdiction. If the plat is rejected, the reviewing, agency shall provide the planning commission with a written statement specifying all aspects where the plat fails to comply. 
                  (f)	Approval by planning commission. Approval or disapproval of the preliminary plat shall be accomplished within 30 days after the plat is filed with the planning commission. If after 30 days the planning commission has failed to act, the preliminary plat shall be deemed approved and heard by the county commission at their next regularly scheduled meeting. 
                  (g)	Approval of construction drawings. Upon approval of the preliminary plat and before preparation of the final construction drawings for the minimum improvements required by these regulations, the subdivider shall receive tentative approval of said engineering plans from the county engineer.

                  Sec. 46-132. - Intent. 
                  The purpose of this article is to recognize, help protect and plan for the county's historic areas. The county finds that its historic areas and their scenic surroundings are important cultural, recreational and economic assets, critical to the public's long-term interest. Zoning standards and regulations should protect these areas while advancing community development goals and furthering and protecting the public's health, safety and welfare. New construction in these areas should complement rather than interrupt, obscure, or otherwise damage or destroy the historic areas.

                  Sec. 46-133. - Description of district. 
                  Historic areas shall be those areas listed and described herein and further delineated on the official zoning map, which is incorporated and made a part of this article. 
                  (1)	Historic areas shall include:
                  a.	Flat Rock Campground Historic Area.
                  b.	Bethel Baptist Church/Wilson's Store Historic Area/Bethel Heard Baptist Church.
                  c.	Old Tennessee Road Historic Area.
                  d.	Bethel Primitive Baptist Church Historic Area.
                  e.	Annie Bell Homeplace/Salem Church and Cemetery Historic Area.
                  f.	David Ridley Farms.
                  (2)	Additional historic areas may be designated by amendment to the zoning chapter, after public hearing, in the manner described in this article.

                  Sec. 46-134. - Applicability. 
                  Historic areas shall function as overlay districts. They may include, be contiguous with, or later become, local historic districts (adopted in accordance with the Georgia Historic Preservation Act of 1980), designated national register properties or districts, or portions thereof. The regulations of such underlying districts and of the underlying zoning districts shall be maintained and not affected, except in the event of conflict or discrepancy between the historic area and the underlying district. In that case, the more stringent requirements shall be observed, unless noted otherwise in this article.

                  Because the county finds that its historic areas are of special interest deemed desirable and necessary to conserve for present and future owners, the county shall: 
                  (1)	Incorporate into the county comprehensive plan updates and short-term work plans, specific goals for the historic areas relative to land use, housing, community facilities, economic development and natural and historic resources; 
                  (2)	As part of such planning, have special regard for and give special attention to the design, construction and maintenance needs of public thoroughfares, pedestrian ways, open spaces, landscape elements (including trees), recreation areas and comparable amenities of the area, and prepare plans, designs, sketches and/or models proposing public improvement of these facilities and areas; 
                  (3)	Prepare special and detailed recommendations with respect to improved housing, education, employment, health, protection and other human resource requirements of the historic areas; 
                  (4)	Ensure appropriate communication among interested public agencies, and provide for the active participation by residents of the historic areas in the preparation of plan elements and program elements noted above; 
                  (5)	Designate a responsible local government official to coordinate these activities;
                  (6)	Recommend to the county board of commissioners, by a certain date, ways and means by which the county should improve its maintenance and operating programs within the designated historic areas, if applicable; and 
                  (7)	Ensure that no county program of any kind results in adverse impacts on the designated historic areas.

                  Sec. 46-136. - Visual compatibility standards. 
                  (a)	Buffer zones. Any land lot proposed to be subdivided or otherwise developed that is contiguous to a designated historic area shall include a vegetative buffer between the lot to be developed and adjacent historic area. The buffer shall be provided by the owner of the property proposed to be developed. 
                  (1)	If the lot proposed to be developed is located within the historic area itself, then the buffer shall be between the lot to be developed and other adjacent lots in the historic area. 
                  (2)	If the proposed development and adjacent historic area fall within different zoning districts, then the buffer shall be as specified in section 46-219(b)(3). 
                  (3)	If the two lots are both within the same zoning district, then the minimum buffer area of 50 feet shall apply. The county board of commissioners may waive this requirement, however, if it is found that: 
                  a.	The proposed new construction will be visually compatible with the historic area;
                  b.	The historic area already has sufficient buffer area to protect it from visual intrusions; and/or 
                  c.	This buffer would adversely affect the character of the historic area, by isolating it from its larger compatible surroundings, for example. 
                  (b)	Other standards. In addition to any other provisions of this article, zoning ordinance or other applicable law, anyone who lives in, or owns property within, an existing or proposed historic area may request additional visual compatibility standards for that historic area, relating to new construction within that historic area, landscaping, sign placement, demolition protocols, or other. Any such proposal must originate from a person living in or owning property in the affected historic area. Such requests shall be submitted to the county historic preservation commission, on forms available at the county planning and zoning office. The historic preservation commission will review each request and forward the request (with comments) to the county planning commission. The planning commission will then review the request, schedule a public hearing before the county board of commissioners, and provide a recommendation at that hearing, prior to decision by the board of commissioners.

                  (a)	Provisions of the overlay district shall be administered by the county and its departments.
                  (b)	Proposals to designate historic rural areas may be submitted by the county historic preservation commission, the county planning commission, the county board of commissioners, the county residents, or owners of property in the county. 
                  (c)	Proposals to establish special visual compatibility standards for proposed or designated historic areas may be submitted only by persons living in or owning property within those historic areas, other provisions of this zoning chapter and other applicable law notwithstanding. 
                  (d)	All proposals to designate historic rural areas and/or establish visual compatibility standards for those areas must be submitted to the historic preservation commission on forms available at the county planning and zoning office. 
                  (e)	Proposals to designate historic rural areas and/or establish visual compatibility standards shall be reviewed by the county historic preservation commission and the county planning commission, and approved or disapproved by the county board of commissioners after public hearing per requirements of article XIV of this chapter. Notice of the public hearing on the proposed designation of the historic area shall be mailed to all owners of property within the proposed area, as well as to the owners of property adjacent to the proposed area. The originator of proposal to designate historic rural areas shall be responsible for providing a list of all property owners to be notified. 
                  (f)	The county board of commissioners, after consultation with the county historic preservation commission and the county planning commission, may revoke the designation of any historic area that subsequently loses its historic character or visual integrity. 
                  (g)	Decisions by the county board of commissioners may be appealed in the manner described in this chapter.

                  (a)	The limits of the Chattahoochee River corridor protection (CRCP) district are hereby defined to be all areas within 100 feet horizontally of the river, measured from the river bank. This area shall remain in an undisturbed vegetative buffer. The 100-foot buffer is measured from the uppermost part of the river bank, usually marked by a break in slope. Although not within the buffer area, the area between the top of the river bank and the water's edge shall be included in the CRCP district. 
                  (b)	Because these protective measures allow some latitude with land uses and because the district is not intended to prescribe a specific land use but rather, to define a range of acceptable land uses, the Chattahoochee River corridor protection district is designed as an overlay district. Within the range of land uses which can be located within the district, this article establishes performance standards which apply to development within the district. The regulations of the underlying zoning district shall be maintained and not affected, except in the event of conflict or discrepancy between the CRCP district and the underlying district. In that case, the more stringent requirements shall be observed.

                  ARTICLE X. - MANUFACTURED HOMES AND MANUFACTURED HOME PARKS 

                  Sec. 46-290. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of the article is to provide standards and regulations to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizen of the county. The county recognizes that manufactured housing meets the needs of many county residents for affordable housing and is compatible with site-built housing if developed in accordance with comparable standards. These regulations shall govern the use and operation of all manufactured homes on single lots or within parks used for permanent residential occupancy, as well as recreational vehicle parks used for temporary occupancy, in the unincorporated county. It is the intent of these regulations to empower the county planning commission, the county health department, and the building inspections department to review the development of manufactured home sites, manufactured home parks, and recreational vehicle parks, within the unincorporated areas of the county for the purposes stated in this article. 
                  (Ord. No. 80-100, § 11.1, 1-12-1999) 
                  Sec. 46-291. - Manufactured homes. 
                  (a)	Nonconforming use. Nonconforming mobile/manufactured home parks lawfully existing at the time of adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived may be continued, but if such nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of 90 days, the manufactured home park shall be made to conform with the requirements of these regulations prior to its being occupied again. Any expansion or addition to an existing manufactured home park shall be in compliance with these regulations, as amended. 
                  (b)	Location disclosure and decal requirement. Every person holding title to, or possession of, a manufactured home which is placed or located within the limits of the county, shall report the location of, and obtain a location decal for, said manufactured home from the tax commissioner, of the county annually, no later than April 1 of each year. Such location decal shall be designed in such manner and affixed to the manufactured home in such manner as to cause it to be easily visible for inspection. 
                  (c)	Issuance of permit. Any owner of a manufactured home, whether locating or relocating said manufactured home, shall obtain a permit from the building inspector of the county indicating compliance with all applicable codes before any person are authorized to occupy any newly installed manufactured home. 
                  (d)	Permit application procedures. A manufactured home permit to move a manufactured home into or within the county shall not be issued by the county building inspector until the following conditions have been met in accordance with established administrative procedures: 
                  (1)	A valid location decal must be issued from the tax commissioners' office and attached to the manufactured home. 
                  (2)	All manufactured homes located in the county shall be a model year 1985 or later.
                  (3)	All manufactured homes must be located at an approved manufactured home space, or in an approved manufactured home park subject to the requirements of this article. 
                  (4)	For individual lots not approved under the manufactured home park regulations, a sanitary permit must be obtained from the county health department for on site sewage disposal, or in the event that sewer will be provided, a letter shall be provided by the local government providing the service verifying they will allow public sewer hookup. 
                  (5)	For purposes of this section, the tax commissioner shall issue the aforementioned location decal, the building inspector shall issue the aforementioned building permit, and the health department shall mention the aforementioned sanitary permit. Upon issuance of the required permits, a manufactured home may be moved into the county or within the county and installed for occupancy. 
                  (6)	All manufactured homes located on individual lots will adhere to the appearance standards set forth in article II of this chapter. The type of appearance standard required will depend on the zoning district where the manufactured home is located. 
                  (7)	All manufactured homes to be located in the county shall not be more than 20 years old, measured from the year they are issued a permit. 
                  No zoning district in the county will permit location of a mobile home built before June 1, 1976. There shall be no permits issued for mobile homes built prior to June 1, 1976. 
                  (e)	Exception to the issuance of a building permit. A building permit shall be required to locate a manufactured home in the county except under the following condition: 
                  (1)	Manufactured homes may be brought in the county and located on a sales lot of a state approved dealer as listed in the office of the state safety fire commissioner for sale without a building or sanitary permit. 
                  (2)	However, under no exceptions shall any manufactured home, which is located on a sales lot, be occupied unless all permit requirements in these regulations are met. Installation must comply with the rules and regulations for manufactured homes, chapter 120-3-7, appendix A, made and promulgated by the state safety fire commissioner, pursuant to authority set forth in Ga. Adm. Code § 120-3-7 (Comp. R. and Regs. § 120-3-7). 
                  (f)	Provision for temporary power after the issuance of a building permit. The building inspector; after inspection, is authorized to permit the applicable power company to provide temporary power not to exceed 120 volts for the express purpose of completing necessary construction and installation of the manufactured home. This provision specifically does not authorize permanent power hookup or occupancy of the manufactured home. It shall be unlawful for temporary power to be utilized on a permanent basis or for occupancy of said home. 
                  (g)	Minimum construction standards. Each newly installed manufactured home in the county shall conform to the minimum construction standards required by U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD), as required by the National Mobile Home and Safety Standards Act of 1974, 42 USC 5401 et seq., before that manufactured home is entitled to receive any utility service to said manufactured home.

Adm. Code § 120-3-7 (Comp. R. and Regs. § 120-3-7). All manufactured homes shall be installed to meet the manufacturer's regulations. At the time of inspection, the space beneath each manufactured home shall be enclosed, with the exception of ventilation and access openings, and according to the appearance provisions in section 46-99. The residential zone of each manufactured home will dictate which type it must meet (see permitted use table 46-101). At the time of request for building permit number of ventilation openings shall be set by codes enforcement. The standards are more specifically explained in the rules and regulations for manufactured homes. The enclosing materials shall extend from the lower edge of the exterior walls of the manufactured home to the ground surface level of the paid on which it is located. All ventilation and access openings shall be covered with wire-mesh screen or its equivalent. 
                  (i)	Inspection for manufactured homes. The following requirements shall pertain to the installation of manufactured homes on individual lots or in parks. 
                  (1)	Foundation.

                  (1)	The change, reestablishment, enlargement, rebuilding, alteration, repair or replacement would be no more detrimental to the surrounding area than the existing or previous use.

                  (3)	The structure would have to be removed to permit development of the property for conforming uses. 
                  (4)	The structure has such value that removal to permit development of the conforming uses would cause economic hardship to the owner. 
                  (5)	The proposed change, reestablishment, enlargement, rebuilding, alteration, replacement or repair would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of this chapter. 
                  (6)	The requirements of this chapter for rezoning would prevent the current zoning from being changed to a classification that would allow the proposed change, reestablishment, enlargement, rebuilding, alteration, repair or replacement.

                  Sec. 46-451. - Purpose. 
                  It is essential that the quality and supply of public drinking water be reasonably protected. This article provides for the establishment of buffer zones around streams, specifies allowable impervious surface densities within watersheds, and requires the use of best management practices for land use within the water supply districts. Natural protection such as buffer areas are best able to filter rainfall and stormwater runoff prior to that water flowing into perennial streams, which lead to water supply reservoirs. Minimizing the transport of pollutants and sediments to the water supply reservoirs guarantees a healthy yield from the water supply watersheds. This protection is necessary for the enhancement of public health, safety and welfare as well as to assure that surface sources of drinking water are of high quality and reasonably free from contaminating sources in order to be treated to meet all state and federal drinking water standards.
