PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Rincon, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1984 Code and ordinances subsequently adopted by the mayor and council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1984 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Ronald K. McLaughlin, Supervising Editor, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Stan Freeman, City Manager, Bill Godlove, City Attorney, and Wanda Goodwin, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  (a)	During council meetings, councilpersons shall neither by conversation or otherwise delay or interrupt the proceedings, nor refuse to obey the orders of the mayor or the rules of the council. Every councilperson desiring to speak shall address the chair and, upon recognition by the mayor, shall confine himself to the question under debate and shall avoid all personalities and indecorous language. Every councilperson desiring to question the administrative staff shall address his question to the mayor, who shall be entitled either to answer the inquiries himself or to designate some member of his staff for that purpose. A councilperson, once recognized, shall not be interrupted while speaking unless called to order by the mayor or unless a point of order is raised by another member, or unless the speaker chooses to yield to questions from another member. If a councilperson is called to order while he is speaking, he shall cease speaking immediately until the question of order is determined. If ruled to be in order, he shall be permitted to proceed. If ruled to be not in order, he shall remain silent or shall alter his remarks so as to comply with rules of the council. All members of the council shall accord the utmost courtesy to each other, to city employees and to members of the public appearing before the council, and shall refrain at all times from rude and derogatory remarks, reflections as to integrity, abusive comments and statements as to motives and personalities. Councilpersons shall confine their questions to the particular matters before the assembly and in debate shall confine their remarks to the issues before the council. Members shall be removed from the meeting for failure to comply with decisions of the mayor or for continued violations of the rules of the council. If the mayor fails to act, any member may move to require him to enforce the rules, and affirmative vote of a majority of the council shall require the mayor to act. 
                  (b)	Members of the administrative staff and employees of the city shall observe the same rules of procedure and decorum applicable to members of the council. Any nonmember of the council desiring to address the council shall be recognized by the chair, shall state his name for the record, and shall limit his remarks to the matter under discussion. All remarks and questions addressed to the council shall be addressed to the council as a whole and not to any individual member thereof. No staff member other than the staff member having the floor shall enter into any discussion either directly or indirectly without permission of the mayor. 
                  (c)	Members of the public attending council meetings also shall observe the same rules of propriety, decorum and good conduct applicable to members of the council. Any person making personal, impertinent and slanderous remarks or who becomes boisterous while addressing the council or while attending a council meeting shall be removed from the room at the direction of the mayor, and such person shall be barred from further audience before the council. Unauthorized remarks from the audience, stamping of feet, whistles, yells and similar demonstrations shall not be permitted by the mayor, who shall direct the removal of such offenders from the room. Aggravated cases shall be prosecuted on appropriate complaint signed by the mayor. In case the mayor shall fail to act, any member of the council may move to require him to act to enforce the rules, and the affirmative vote of the majority of the council shall require the mayor to act.

                  (1)	To clear a matter of fact; 
                  (2)	To explain himself in some material part of his speech; or 
                  (3)	With regard to the matter of words of the question, keeping himself to these only, and not going into the merits of it, and not falling into the matter itself. 
                  (b)	On an amendment being moved, a member who has spoken to the main question may speak again to the amendment. 
                  Sec. 2-59. - Appeal from rulings of mayor. 
                  Any councilperson may appeal to the council from a ruling of the mayor. If the appeal is seconded, the member making the appeal may briefly state his reason for the appeal, and the mayor may briefly explain his ruling, but there shall be no debate on the appeal and no other member shall participate in the discussion. The mayor shall then put the question: "Shall the appeal be sustained?" If a majority of the members present vote "aye," the ruling of the chair is overruled. 
                  Sec. 2-60. - Addressing council on question of personal privilege.

The motion for adjournment shall always be in order, and be decided without debate.

                  When the council shall decide to go into committee of the whole, without objection the regular officers shall continue to serve; otherwise, the council shall appoint a chairman to preside, and the mayor shall leave the chair. The rules of the council, as far as applicable, shall be observed in the committee of the whole, except that no limit shall be placed on the frequency of speaking, that the yeas and nays shall not be taken, and that a motion to rise and report progress shall always be in order and shall be decided without debate.

                  When a motion is made and seconded at a council meeting, it shall be stated by the chair before debate. Any member may demand that it be put in writing. 
                  Sec. 2-66. - Motion to adjourn. 
                  (a)	A motion to adjourn a council meeting shall be in order at any time, except as follows: 
                  (1)	When repeated without intervening business or discussion; 
                  (2)	When made as an interruption of a member while speaking; 
                  (3)	When the previous question has been ordered; and 
                  (4)	While a vote is being taken. 
                  (b)	A motion to adjourn is debatable only as to the time to which the meeting is adjourned. 
                  Sec. 2-67. - Motion to lay on the table. 
                  A motion before the council to lay on the table shall preclude all amendments or debate of the subject under consideration. If the motion shall prevail, the consideration of the subject may be resumed only upon motion of a member voting with the majority and with the consent of two-thirds of the members present. 
                  Sec. 2-68. - Moving the previous question. 
                  When the previous question is moved at a council meeting, and seconded by one other member, it shall be put as follows: "Shall the main question be now put?" There shall then be no further amendment or debate, but, following an affirmative vote, pending amendments shall be put in their order before the main question. If the question: "Shall the main question be now put" be decided in the negative, the main question remains before the council. 
                  Sec. 2-69. - Division of question.

                  (b)	On an amendment to strike out and insert, the paragraph to be amended shall first be read as it stands, then the words proposed to be stricken out and those to be inserted shall be read, and finally the paragraph as it would stand if so amended shall be read. 
                  (c)	An amendment modifying the intention of a motion shall be in order, but an amendment relating to a different matter shall not be in order.

                  Sec. 2-72. - Reconsideration of action. 
                  After the decision on any question, any member of the council who voted with the majority may move a reconsideration of any action at the same or the next succeeding meeting; provided, however, that a resolution authorizing or relating to any contract may be reconsidered at any time before the final execution thereof. A motion to reconsider shall require the same number of votes as is required to adopt an ordinance or resolution. After a motion for reconsideration has once been acted on, no other motion for a reconsideration thereof shall be made without unanimous consent. 
                  Sec. 2-73. - Special orders. 
                  It shall require the consent of a majority of the members present at a council meeting to make any subject a special order. 
                  Sec. 2-74. - Unsigned communications. 
                  Unsigned communications shall not be introduced in the council. 
                  Sec. 2-75. - Tie votes. 
                  In the case of a tie vote of the council where the mayor's vote does not break the tie, the proposal shall be considered lost. 
                  Sec. 2-76. - Rules of order generally. 
                  (a)	Every question of order at a council meeting shall be decided by the chair without debate, subject to an appeal of the council, and the chair may call for the consent of the council on any question of order. If repeated calls do not produce order, the member is to be called by name. 
                  (b)	Where the private interests of a member are concerned in a question, he is to withdraw, and when such an interest has appeared his voice is to be disallowed. 
                  (c)	No motion shall be debated or put until the motion is seconded. It is then, and not until then, in possession of council, and cannot be withdrawn but by leave of council. 
                  (d)	When a proposition is moved which is useless or inexpedient, the previous question is introduced for suppressing, for that time, the motion and its discussion, in which case the main question is to be put immediately without any further debate, and in the form in which it then exists; but, as the previous question applies that day only, and it may recur again, if it is desired to suppress entirely, the motion shall be to postpone indefinitely. 
                  (e)	When a proper motion is made, but information wanted, the motion is to postpone to a day certain. 
                  (f)	When a matter is introduced claiming present attention, but which it is desired to reserve for a more suitable occasion, the order is to lay on the table, and it may then be called for at any time. If the proposition or matter needs further consideration, the order shall be to refer to a committee, but if it needs but a few and simple amendments, the council shall proceed to consider and amend it at once. 
                  (g)	On motion to amend an ordinance, any member may move to commit it or refer it to a committee, and the question for commitment shall be first put. An amendment to an amendment is admitted, but to amend an amendment to an amendment is not. 
                  (h)	The question is to be put first on the affirmative and then on the negative side. 
                  (i)	When a question has been moved and seconded, and been put by the chair in the affirmative and negative, it becomes a full question, and cannot be debated afterwards, unless under motion for reconsideration. 
                  (j)	The consequences of a measure may be reprobated in strong terms, but to arraign the motives of those who propose or advocate it is a personality and against order. 
                  (k)	Any member shall be heard at any time on a matter of personal privilege, and such request to be heard shall be given precedence. 
                  Sec. 2-77. - Use of Robert's Rules of Order.

                  ARTICLE VIII. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS 

                  Sec. 18-240. - Adult entertainment establishments; findings; public purpose. 
                  (a)	Based on the experiences of other counties and municipalities including, but not limited to, Atlanta; DeKalb County and Fulton County, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Los Angeles, California; and Indianapolis, Indiana, with establishments offering public nudity in conjunction with the sale of alcoholic beverages, which experiences are relevant to the problems potentially faced by the City of Rincon, Georgia, and based on the evidence and testimony of persons who have appeared before us, the mayor and council take note of the well-known and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. 
                  (b)	Moreover, it is the reasonable belief and finding of the mayor and council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment," leads to an increase in the surrounding area of criminal behavior and creates undesirable community conditions, blight and diminution in property values. In the same manner, establishments offering photographic or videographic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the community. 
                  (c)	Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, live commercial nudity in general, and photographic adult entertainment are disorderly conduct, prostitution, solicitation, drug trafficking, drug use and corruption of public officials. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and photographic adult entertainment are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described. Furthermore, it is the reasonable belief and finding of the mayor and council that other forms of adult entertainment including, but not limited to, adult bookstores, peep shows, adult theaters and massage parlors have a deleterious effect upon the quality of life in neighborhoods, commercial districts and urban life in general. 
                  (d)	Accordingly, it is reasonably believed to be in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community to reduce the adverse impact of adult entertainment facilities by limiting the number of such uses, so as to reduce the negative impacts of adult entertainment facilities or adult uses upon other business uses, neighborhood property values, residential areas and public and semipublic uses; to insure that adult uses and adult entertainment facilities do not impede development, redevelopment and neighborhood revitalization efforts; and so as to avoid allowing adult entertainment and adult uses in heavily used public pedestrian areas. 
                  (e)	Therefore, the limitation of adult uses and adult entertainment to certain prescribed areas of the city is reasonably believed to be in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to minimize the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which provide or establish adult entertainment or adult uses. To that end, this article is hereby adopted.

The rules of evidence and examination of witnesses shall be the same as in the superior courts, so far as such rules are applicable to the case on trial. All officers, informers and persons injured shall be competent witnesses. In general, the municipal court shall be controlled by the rules of practice governing the superior courts, so far as they are applicable to municipal courts, and by a sound construction of the Charter and ordinances of the city. 
                  Sec. 26-14. - Guilty pleas. 
                  Any party charged with the violation of any provision of this Code or any ordinance of the city may file his plea of "Guilty" under such rules as the court may direct.

                  In each case of a conviction in the municipal court, the costs assessable shall be as set forth in the schedule of fees and charges. Costs shall go into the general fund of the city for general municipal purposes. Defendants unable to pay costs, and compelled in lieu of payment to work on the public works, shall be each required to work two days to cover costs. 
                  Sec. 26-16. - Contempt. 
                  Any person who, during a session of the municipal court, shall be guilty of a contempt of court, or who refuses to abide by any sentence or order of the court, shall be punished as provided by section 1-11 of this Code. 
                  Sec. 26-17. - Collection of fines and fees. 
                  a)	When directed by the municipal judge, the clerk shall issue executions for fines imposed by the court, including costs, which executions may be levied upon any goods or chattels, lands, or tenements of the person so fined.

                  Sec. 34-31. - Excessive noise prohibited. 
                  (a)	No person shall make, continue or cause to be made or continued any loud unnecessary or excessive noise which unreasonably interferes with the comfort and repose of others within the jurisdiction of the city. 
                  (b)	It shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or willfully or through his culpable negligence to make or create excessive noise within the city as heard by persons and measured in the manner hereinafter set forth.

                  Plainly audible means any sound that can be detected by a person using his or her unaided hearing faculties. Example: If the sound source under investigation is a portable or personal vehicular sound amplification or reproduction device, the enforcement officer need not determine the title of a song, specific words, or the artist performing the song. The detection of the rhythmic base component of the music is sufficient to constitute a plainly audible sound.

                  Sec. 34-64. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)	General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES General Permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of section 34-64(b) and (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES General Permit. 
                  (b)	Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)	Best management practices as set forth in section 34-64(b) and (c) of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)	A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)	Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)	The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)	The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in (c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)	The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)	Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)	Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)	Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)	Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)	The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)	Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)	Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)	Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)	To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)	Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)	Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)	Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)	Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)	Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 34-64(b)(2) of this article; 
                  (15)	Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the Director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.	No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.	The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)	There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.	No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.	The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)	Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in section 34-64(b) and (c) of this article. 
                  (e)	The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

                  Sec. 34-65. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)	General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)	Application requirements. 
                  (1)	No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of Rincon without first obtaining a permit from the City of Rincon to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)	The application for a permit shall be submitted to the building and zoning department and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 34-65(c) of this article. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 34-64(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)	In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8 half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the Division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)	Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 34-64(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per section 34-65(b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)	If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)	The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)	Plan requirements. 
                  (1)	Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 34-64(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)	Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)	Permits. 
                  (1)	Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)	No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 34-64(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per section 34-65(b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)	Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)	If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)	The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)	The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1).

                  (a)	The City of Rincon will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)	The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)	The City of Rincon shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)	No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)	The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)	The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  (b)	Stop-work orders. 
                  (1)	For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning;

All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)	Bond forfeiture.

The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)	Monetary penalties. 
                  (1)	Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any city charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation.

                  DIVISION 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 

                  Sec. 42-31. - Authorization. 
                  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the mayor and council of Rincon, Georgia, does ordain as follows. 
                  (Ord. No. O-2010-003 , art. 1, § A, 11-8-10) 
                  Sec. 42-32. - Findings of fact. 
                  (1)	The flood hazard areas of Rincon, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (2)	These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.

                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)	Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)	Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)	Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)	Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  DIVISION 4. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 42-71. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)	New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)	New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)	New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)	Elevated buildings—All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.	Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  (i)	Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  (ii)	The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and, 
                  (iii)	Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction. 
                  b.	So as not to violate the lowest floor criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.	The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)	All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
                  (6)	Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable State requirements for resisting wind forces; 
                  (7)	New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
                  (8)	New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters; 
                  (9)	On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and, 
                  (10)	Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the non- conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)	New construction and/or substantial improvements —Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of division 4, section 42-71(4), elevated buildings. 
                  a.	All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)	Nonresidential construction —New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in division 3, section 42-63(6). 
                  (3)	Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles —Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.	All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.	Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  (i)	The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
                  (ii)	The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.	All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. division 4, section 42-71(6) above.) 
                  d.	All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  (i)	Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, 
                  (ii)	Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions), or 
                  (iii)	The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of division 4, section 42-72(3)(a)—(c), above. 
                  (4)	Floodway —Located within areas of special flood hazard established in division 2, section 42-42, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.	Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.	Only if division 4, section 42-72(4)a. above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 4.

                  (1)	When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with division 2, section 42-42, then the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of division 4. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (a. and b.) shall apply: 
                  a.	No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  b.	In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (Note: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed.) Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of division 4, section 42-71(4), elevated buildings. 
                  (i)	All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site.

                  DIVISION 5. - VARIANCE PROCEDURES 

                  Sec. 42-81. - Variances. 
                  (a)	The planning and zoning board as established by the City of Rincon shall hear and make recommendations, to mayor and city council, for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
                  (b)	The planning and zoning board shall hear and make recommendations, to mayor and city council, for appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
                  (c)	The planning and zoning board shall make recommendation to the mayor and city council for final determination. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the mayor and city council may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Effingham County as provided in O.C.G.A § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)	Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)	Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)	Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)	In reviewing such requests, the planning and zoning board, and mayor and city council, shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)	Conditions for variances. 
                  (1)	A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  i.	A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  ii.	A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  iii.	A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)	The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)	The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)	Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the mayor and city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  Encroachment means to extend within the prescribed boundary of the floodway or regulated area. 
                  Existing construction means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced before February 19, 1987, the effective date of the initial FIRM for that community. 
                  Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before February 19, 1987, the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
                  Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads. 
                  Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
                  a.	The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or

                  Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Insurance Administration, where the boundaries of areas of special flood hazard have been defined as zone A. 
                  Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Insurance Administration, delineating the areas of special flood hazard and/or risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
                  Flood insurance study is the official report by the Federal Insurance Administration evaluating flood hazards and containing flood profiles and water surface elevations of the base flood. 
                  Floodplain means any land area susceptible to flooding. 
                  Floodplain administrator means an individual that has been appointed, and operates under the supervision and guidance of the city planner. Duties include reviewing proposed development, which is also reviewed by the city planner. 
                  Floodproofing means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is: 
                  (1)	Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

                  a.	By an approved state program as determined by the secretary of the interior, or 
                  b.	Directly by the secretary of the interior in states without approved programs. 
                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this Code. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
                  Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced after December 19, 2010, the effective date of the initial FIRM, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, new construction means structures for which the start of construction commenced after February 2, 1987, the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the community, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after February 2, 1987, the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA flood modernization maps. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle, which is: 
                  a.	Built on a single chassis;

                  c.	Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
                  d.	Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: Accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision is the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the start of construction of the improvement. (Note: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring.) This term includes structures, which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  This section is intended to apply to all persons presently engaged in or proposing to be engaged in the retail sale of new tires, used tires, and/or handling of scrap tires. 
                  (a)	Scrap tire generator enforcement. 
                  (1)	Scrap tire generators shall have the necessary licenses and specifications as required by Georgia state law. 
                  (2)	Scrap tire generators shall maintain, pursuant to Georgia state law, accurate records and reports detailing the number of new and/or used replacement tires sold and the amount of fees collected, as well as receipts indicating the disposition of scrap tires. These records shall be maintained on file at the facility in question for three years and shall be made available for inspection by the City of Rincon during normal business hours.

However a person or business entity that generates less than 100 tires per month and that transports only its own scrap tires to EPD approved end users, scrap tire processors, sorters, or disposal facilities is not required to have a scrap tire carrier permit, but must comply with all other provisions required of scrap tire generators and scrap tire carriers. 
                  (6)	Scrap tire generators shall maintain copies of completed manifest records for three years. Such documentation shall be made available for inspection by the City of Rincon during normal business hours. 
                  (7)	Scrap tire generators may choose to determine whether a tire, because of wear, damage or defect, is not suitable for classification as a used tire or retreadable casing as defined in this article. However, if a scrap tire generator fails to sort or delineate which tires are used tires, retreadable casings or scrap tires, then all tires transported shall be considered scrap tires and must be thusly indicated on the shipment manifest.

                  (8)	Scrap tire generators shall mark scrap tires with their EPD issued scrap tire generator number within 24 hours of receipt of the scrap tires.

Said marking shall be at least one inch in height and shall be permanent and waterproof. 
                  (9)	The City Manager and/or its designee shall coordinate to conduct annual random inspections of all scrap tire generators in the City of Rincon to ensure compliance with this article.

The manifest or receipt for the used tires must include: The number of tires, the purchase price, the date of purchase, and the name and address of the seller of the tires. 
                  (3)	The City of Rincon may inspect scrap tire carriers to determine if they have been issued a scrap tire carrier permit by EPD and are in compliance with the requirements for scrap tire carriers prescribed in this article.

                  (5)	Scrap tire carriers shall maintain financial assurance in the form of a performance bond or letter of credit. The financial assurance shall be maintained according to the following criteria: 
                  a.	Five thousand dollars for scrap tire carriers transporting up to 500 scrap tires per month. 
                  b.	Ten thousand dollars for scrap tire carriers transporting more than 500 scrap tires per month. 
                  c.	This requirement may be waived by the city manager or city council if there have been no violations of the scrap tire enforcement ordinance within the last two years. 
                  (6)	The City of Rincon shall review documentation maintained by scrap tire carriers to ensure that the quarterly reports required by the EPD include the number of scrap tires transported and the manner of scrap tire disposition.

                  (c)	Scrap tire storage enforcement. 
                  (1)	It is unlawful for any person or business entity, other than a scrap tire generator as defined in this article or a tire retreader as defined in this article, to allow more than 25 scrap tires to be stored on its premises. A scrap tire generator may store a maximum of 500 scrap tires on its premises and a tire retreader may store a maximum of 3,000 tires on its premises. Storing any quantity of scrap tires in excess of this storage rule constitutes a violation of this article. 
                  (2)	It is unlawful for any person or business entity, including scrap tire generators, to store scrap tires outside of an enclosed building except in a single secured, covered, and locked container. This storage rule will not apply to the following: 
                  a.	Solid waste disposal sites permitted by the EPD if the permit authorizes the storage of scrap tires prior to their disposal;

                  c.	Scrap tire processors approved by the EPD. 
                  (3)	Where scrap tires are stored inside of an enclosed building, said building must be maintained and operated in a manner reasonably sufficient to prevent theft or the potential for scrap tires to be removed from the facility and improperly disposed of.

                  The Rincon and Effingham County Potable Water Agreement and the Effingham County and City of Savannah Water Agreement require Rincon to collect a capital recovery cost charge for each applicable equivalent residential unit (ERU). Said capital recovery cost charges are currently $900.00 to be paid to the City of Savannah and $178.00 to be paid to Effingham County.

                  Sec. 82-31. - Payment; delinquency; penalties; nonpayment; disconnection and discontinuance of service; reconnection fees. 
                  All utility bills will be mailed by the first day of each month. 
                  To avoid a ten percent penalty charge all utility bills must be paid in full by the 15 th day of each month. If the fifteenth (15 th ) day of the month falls on a non business day, the penalty will be assessed at 11:59 p.m. on the next regularly scheduled work day for the City of Rincon. 
                  To avoid an interruption of service (disconnection) all utility bills must be paid in full by the 20 th > day of each month. The failure of the city to insist upon the penalty charge and/or disconnection of services shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent penalties and/or disconnection of service if future utility bills are not paid in a timely manner as outlined above. 
                  Should an interruption of service (disconnection) occur there will be a $25.00 service interruption fee added to the utility bill. An interruption of service is considered to have taken place at 11:59 p.m. on the 20 th > day of each month whether or not the service has been physically interrupted (disconnected). If an interruption of service (disconnection) does occur there shall be no penalty charges added to the service interruption fee. 
                  If the 20 th day of the month falls on a non-business day, then the actual interruption (disconnection) of service will take place on the next regularly scheduled workday for the City of Rincon. This will not eliminate the $25.00 service interruption fee charge referred to in the paragraph listed above.

                  Sec. 82-261. - User charges. 
                  (a)	Established. All persons discharging wastewater into the city public sewers shall be charged a sewer service charge which shall recover the operation and maintenance costs of the wastewater treatment facilities and sewer system, the local share of the capital costs of the treatment facility, and the costs of other capital improvements of the sewerage facilities. 
                  (b)	Basis of user charges. The required annual revenue from sewer charges shall include the following: 
                  (1)	Billing costs; 
                  (2)	Operational and maintenance costs; and 
                  (3)	Debt service. 
                  However, any residential users which have a private well for water purposes shall be permitted to connect a water meter, upon written request, according to the city's specification, at their own expense, to the private well in order for the city to have the means to measure the actual water used for sewer billing purposes. Any costs associated with the maintenance and repair of such meter shall be the sole responsibility of the residential user and not the city. The sewer user charge for residential and commercial users shall be based on water used in each billing period. Between the months of April and September the sewer portion of the total residential utility bill shall not exceed a maximum rate of $25.00. For residential users without water service the sewer user charge will be a flat rate based on the assumed average of 7,500 gallons per month of water used and will be assessed per residence. Industrial users shall be charged on the basis of water used monthly or sewage metered monthly throughout the year. In addition, for high strength wastes, a surcharge will be applied as established in section 82-262. 
                  (c)	Billing charge. A billing charge divided equally among the billing periods will be assessed. 
                  (d)	Operation and maintenance. The required annual revenue for operation and maintenance will be obtained from user charges and industrial surcharges. Anticipated income from industrial surcharges will be deducted from the required OandM revenue and the remainder of the required revenue will be collected from users at the calculated OandM user charge rate as follows: 
                  User Charge Rate for OandM =  OM - S    Q 

                   
                  There is no minimum charge for the OandM User Charge. 
                  (e)	Debt service. The required annual revenue for debt service will be obtained from service charges as set in a rate ordinance. 
                  (f)	Grinder pump charges. Any resident served by a grinder pump unit whose electrical power is provided at city expense will be assessed an additional monthly charge based upon the average monthly cost paid by the city to operate such pump. This fee will be set forth as prescribed in section 82-263. 
                  (Ord. No. 88-011, § 7.01, 10-10-88; Ord. No. 89-015, 10-9-89; Ord. No. 91-001, 1-31-91) 
                  Sec. 82-262. - Industrial wastewater surcharges. 
                  (a)	Established. All industrial contributors whose wastewater discharges exceed 200 mg/l BOD, and/or 200 mg/l suspended solids and/or 700 mg/l COD, and/or 100 mg/l oil or grease, shall be assessed a surcharge in addition to the user charge. The charge shall be based on the proportionally high BOD, suspended solids, COD, and/or oil or grease concentration the industry contributes to the wastewater treatment facility in excess of 200 mg/l BOD, 200 mg/l suspended solids, 700 mg/l COD, and 100 mg/l grease or oil. 
                  (b)	Basis of surcharge. The annual operation and maintenance costs for the first year of operation of the wastewater treatment facility will be allocated as follows: 

                   
                  The expected average daily load at the plant for the subsequent year will be determined based on previous experience. 
                  (c)	Rate of surcharge. The surcharge rate is determined as follows: 
                  BODR = BOD Surcharge/lb. =    BOD OandM Cost     365 × BOD lb./day plant 
                  TSSR = TSS Surcharge/lb. =    TSS OandM Cost     365 × TSS lb./day plant 
                  CODR = COD Surcharge/lb. =    COD OandM Cost     365 × COD lb./day plant 
                  OGR = Oil and Grease Surcharge/lb. =    OG OandM Cost     365 × OG lb./day plant 
                  (d)	Surcharge calculation. The surcharge shall be calculated as follows: 
                  Surcharge = Q × 8.33 [(BODi - 200) × BODR + (TSSi - 200) × TSSR + (CODi - 700) × CODR + (OGi - 100) × OGR] 
                  Where: 

                   
                  (e)	Surcharge rate amendment. The surcharge rate will be analyzed at the same time as user charges are being reviewed and if adjustment of the rates is justified, new rates will be set by council action. 
                  (f)	Monitoring. Monitoring of industrial wastewater will be performed by the city at the control manhole, as required by this article. Monitoring will primarily include measurement of flow and analysis of a composite sample for a five-day BOD, and for total suspended solids of industrial discharges with concentrations of nonsanitary/domestic flows. When discharge of unusual concentrations of other pollutants, such as phosphorus and nitrogen compounds, or toxic pollutants is possible, the city will periodically have additional analyses performed to determine the concentrations of those pollutants which it is possible for the industry to discharge. Flow will be metered as the water used by the industry or the wastewater discharged by the industry. Wastewater discharge will be metered only when the industry has provided an effluent flow meter including recorder and totalizer. The frequency of analysis for biochemical oxygen demand and total suspended solids will be based on daily discharge and will be as follows: 

                   
                  (g)	Costs for monitoring, sampling and analyses. All costs associated with the monitoring, sampling and analyses shall be paid for by the user in addition to normal charges.

                  (a)	Sewer rates. Sewer rates payable under this article shall be as provided in the schedule of fees and charges on file in the office of the city clerk. 
                  (b)	Adoption. A rate ordinance based on section 86-261 shall be adopted to recover costs for administration, operation and maintenance, debt service and miscellaneous expenses of the sewer system. 
                  (c)	Amendments. The rate ordinance shall be reviewed annually and amended, as necessary, to generate adequate revenue to offset all expenses of the sewer system. 
                  (d)	Notification. All users shall be notified at least annually of the rates in effect for sewer service including the breakdown of the portion of the rate which is attributable to the operation of the city sewer system. Such notification shall be published in the legal organ of this community.

                  Editor's note— Ordinance No. 2004-001, adopted February 9, 2004, did not specifically amend the Code. Therefore, §§ 82-271—82-276 was added at the discretion of the editor. 

                  Sec. 82-271. - Introduction. 
                  Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the city manager, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing FOG (fats, oil and grease) or any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Grease and oil separators shall conform to City of Rincon's Grease Interceptor Standards. 
                  All interceptors shall be supplied, installed and properly and continuously maintained in a satisfactory and effective operational manner by the owner at his expense. 
                  In addition it is prohibited that any water or waste containing fats, wax, grease, or oils whether emulsified or not, in excess of 100 mg/L or containing substances which may solidify or become viscous at temperatures between 32° F and 150° F. 
                  The purpose of this grease trap standard is to provide specific guidelines for grease trap location, design, installation, construction and maintenance in conjunction and compliance with the above requirements. Failure to comply with this standard shall be considered violations of applicable section of existing combined sewer use and pretreatment ordinance and consequently will be subject to applicable penalties and/or denial or discontinuance of service as specified in section 82-273 of the division.

                  Food service establishment. Any commercial facility discharging kitchen or food preparation wastewaters including restaurants, motels, hotels, cafeterias, hospitals, schools, bars, etc. and any other facility which, in the administrator's opinion, would require a grease trap installation by virtue of its operation. 
                  Grease interceptor/grease trap. The device which is utilized to effect the separation of grease and oils in wastewater effluents from food service establishments. Such traps or interceptors may be of the outdoor or underground type normally referred to as large grease interceptors, or the "under the counter" package units normally referred to as the smaller grease traps. However, for purposes of this standard, the words "trap" and "interceptor" are generally used interchangeable.

                  The following design, administrative, operational, and other requirements are applicable to all food service establishments, new or existing. Particular requirements for grease trap/interceptor construction, specifically pertaining to both new and existing food service establishments, can be found in section 82-274 of this standard. 
                  (1)	All food service establishments shall have grease-handling facilities approved by the City of Rincon. Establishments whose grease handling facilities are not in accordance with this standard shall be given a compliance schedule with a deadline not to exceed six months from initial notification date. 
                  (2)	All food service establishment grease-handling facilities/operations shall be subject to periodic review, evaluations, and inspection by the City of Rincon representatives at any time. Results of inspections will be made available to facility owners, with overall ratings assigned and recommendations for correction/improvement (if necessary) delineated. 
                  (3)	Any facility receiving three consecutive unsatisfactory evaluations shall be subject to penalties/restrictions as provided for in the use and rate resolution for non compliance with the resolution requirements. 
                  (4)	Violations of this City of Rincon standard will be considered grounds for discontinuance of water and/or sewer service. 
                  (5)	Food service establishments whose operations cause or allow excessive grease to discharge or accumulate in the sewer collection system are liable to the wastewater quality control department for all costs related to wastewater quality control department service calls for line blockages, line cleanings, line and pump repairs, etc. Including all labor, materials, equipment, and overhead. Failure to pay all service related charges may also be grounds for water/sewer service discontinuance. 
                  a.	Maintenance contracts and/or records of grease removal frequencies for grease handling facilities may be required at the discretion of the wastewater quality control department to be submitted periodically to ensure routine and adequate system maintenance. 
                  b.	In the maintaining of the grease interceptors, the owner(s) shall be responsible for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate means of the captured material and shall maintain on site records of the dates, and means of disposal which are subject to review by the wastewater quality control department. Any removal and hauling of the collected materials not performed by owner(s) personnel must be performed by currently licensed waste disposal firms. 
                  (6)	Any food service establishment whose effluent is suspected or perceived by the wastewater quality control department to contain a concentration of greater than 100 mg/l of oil and grease may be required to routinely sample their grease trap effluent and have it analyzed for oil and greases at the expense of the owner and furnish a copy of the analysis to the wastewater quality control department. 
                  (7)	All grease traps/interceptors shall be designed and installed in accordance with this standard to allow for complete access to inspection, maintenance, etc. 
                  (Ord. No. 2004-001, § III, 2-9-04) 
                  Sec. 82-274. - Construction standards. 
                  (a)	New facilities. 
                  (1)	All newly constructed food service establishments shall be required to install a grease interceptor, approved by the City of Rincon. Grease interceptor shall be sized at ten gallons per food service seat, with no interceptor less than 1,000 gallons total capacity. 
                  (2)	All grease trap/interceptor plans and specifications must be reviewed and approved by the City of Rincon prior to installation. 
                  (3)	The construction and location criteria for grease interceptors shall be in accordance with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Guidance Document, "On-Site Wastewater Treatment and Disposal Systems," Chapter 8. Typical construction detail drawings for acceptable grease traps are attached to this standard. 
                  (4)	All grease interceptors, whether singular or in series, must be directly accessible from the surface and must be fitted with an extended outlet sanitary tee that terminates six inches—12 inches above the tank floor. The minimum access opening dimensions shall be 18 inches × 18 inches. 
                  (5)	All grease interceptors service fixtures where the total sewage flow exceeds 1,500 GPD must either be two-chambered or individual tanks in series. If two-chambered, the dividing wall must be equipped with an extended elbow or sanitary tee terminating six inches—12 inches above the tank floor. An extended outlet sanitary tee must also be provided at the outlet of the second chamber. Both chambers must be directly accessible from the surface. See attached drawings included in this standard. 
                  (6)	Above criteria (1)—(5) apply primarily to outdoor type grease trap units. 
                  (7)	Maintenance of grease traps/interceptors must include thorough pump-out and/or cleaning as needed, with a minimum frequency of four times per year. Maintenance contracts may be required to be submitted to the wastewater quality control department as called for in section 82-273(6) of this standard. The owner, however, is ultimately responsible for the proper maintenance of the grease trap facility(s). 
                  (8)	No new food service facility will be allowed to initiate operations until grease handling facilities are installed and approved by the City of Rincon. 
                  (b)	Existing facilities. 
                  (1)	All existing food service establishments shall have grease-handling facilities approved by City of Rincon. Food service establishments without any grease handling facilities will be given a compliance deadline not to exceed six months from date of notification to have approved and install grease-handling equipment in compliance with this standard. Failure to do so will be considered a violation of the existing Combined Sewer Use and Pretreatment Ordinance and will subject the establishment to penalties and/or service discontinuance. 
                  (2)	a.	For cases in which "outdoor" type grease interceptors are infeasible to install, existing food service establishments will be required to install adequate and approved "under-the-counter" grease traps for use on individual fixtures, including dishwashers, sinks, and other potentially grease containing drains. In such cases, units will be considered acceptable only if approved flow control fittings are provided to the grease interceptor inlet to prevent overloading of the grease trap and to allow for proper interceptor operation. 
                  In such cases as the above, the owner(s) will be notified of the existing system deficiencies and given a compliance deadline not to exceed six months to have approved and installed grease-handling facilities or appurtenances. The Rincon City Manager must give approval of flow control devices and grease trap design prior to installation. 
                  b.	For cases in which "outdoor" units are feasible to install, construction requirements will be as specified in section 82-274(a) of this standard, i.e. new facilities. 
                  (3)	In most cases, wastewater from garbage grinders should not be discharged to grease traps/interceptors. 
                  (4)	In the maintaining of existing grease traps/interceptors, the owner(s) shall be responsible for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate means of the captured material and shall maintain records of the dates and means of disposal which are subject by the water quality control wastewater department. 
                  (5)	In the event of an existing food service establishments grease handling facilities are either under designed, substandard, or poorly operated, the owners(s) will be notified, in writing, of the required improvements and given a compliance deadline not to exceed six months to conform with these requirements of this grease standard. 
                  (6)	Exclusive use of enzymes or other grease solvents, emulsifiers, etc. is not considered acceptable grease trap maintenance practice. 
                  (7)	Grease consuming bacteria may be considered for interim approval for grease trap maintenance, provided approval is obtained for the water quality control wastewater department and providing that this control method is considered effective and satisfactory to the water quality control wastewater inspector. Exclusive use of bacteria may not be sufficient for long term grease trap maintenance, especially for non-biodegradable waste fractions. 
                  (c)	New food service establishments in existing buildings. New food service establishments locating in existing buildings will be required to comply with the grease trap standards applicable to new facilities, i.e., outdoor type grease trap units (minimum size 1,000 gallons) shall be installed.

                  Sec. 86-48. - Street tree trimming guidelines. 
                  The following guidelines will outline accepted tree trimming and tree maintenance standards to be followed when such work is deemed necessary on street trees. A street tree means any tree on the street right-of-way. The following guidelines apply to public utilities, contractors hired by public utilities and tree crews working for the city: 
                  (1)	All trees designated for trimming shall be trimmed according to International Society of Arboriculture Terminal and American National Standards Institute (A300) standards. 
                  (2)	Trees trimmed for clearance from utility lines may be trimmed by qualified utility line clearance personnel in such a manner as to provide clearance from the utility lines for a designated period of time or cycle. Clearance is defined as the distance necessary to prevent regrowth from contacting utility lines before the tree is retrimmed on the designated cycle. In all cases where conditions permit, drop-crotch or side trimming, or directional pruning methods to obtain necessary clearance will be used. 
                  (3)	When necessary trimming harms the shape of the tree, such additional trimming shall be done so as to give the tree satisfactory shape and appearance and minimize present and future structural problems. All cuts two inches in diameter or more shall be painted with appropriate tree paint. 
                  (4)	Where possible, all cuts should be made leaving the basal branch collar intact in order to eliminate excessive sprouts and unsightly stubs. A stub is defined as any limb not cut to a branch collar or any limb cut to a lateral less than one-third the diameter of the cut limb. 
                  (5)	All cuts shall be made in a method to prevent rips, tears or disruption on the bark. 
                  (6)	No limb hangers shall be left in trees. 
                  (7)	The persons trimming the trees are responsible for disposal of wood residue (chips, logs and limbs) and safety and control of the area while on the site.

                  Sec. 86-51. - Storm damaged tree management. 
                  (a)	The tree administrator and the public works director will assess damaged trees and prioritize public safety concerns by the tree damage classifications. When too many storm damaged trees are left standing in communities after storm clearance activities have been completed and these trees remain, or can quickly become, hazardous, the hazardous trees must be removed as soon as possible. Trees that could quickly develop into hazardous trees need to be evaluated and treated at the same time. 
                  (b)	Good storm damage management is the removal of fallen, heavily damaged, hazardous, and soon to be hazardous trees. Good storm damage management is much more cost-effective over the long run than cleaning up fallen materials now and reacting to tree calls in the future. While equipment and personnel are available, all trees in need shall be treated. 
                  (c)	Storm damaged tree evaluations should be performed by a trained urban forester/arborist before or at the time of initial tree crew attack. Minimizing liability risks, protecting community assets (including trees), and/or better management of community asset appreciation are the primary reasons for any treatment. 
                  (d)	Tree work shall be prioritized by public safety concerns and tree damage class as follows: 
                  (1)	Class I damage: 
                  Dead tree 
                  Snapped or twisted stem breaks 
                  Major branch collapse (greater than 50 percent of live crown affected) 
                  Roots broken, tree pushed over 
                  Roots broken, tree leaning 
                  Leaning or bent pine 
                  Lightning strike, general pines 
                  Lightning strike, hardwoods (greater than 30 percent of bark circumference affected) 
                  Branch damage leaving severely lopsided crown (70 percent or more of crown on one side of tree) 
                  Tree left with large stress or twist cracks in main stem 
                  Interfering with utility right-of-way safety and maintenance 
                  Split tree (hazard from remaining stem falling) 
                  Hardwood tree with more than 50 percent of live branches broken or damaged 
                  Pines with more than 30 percent of live branches broken or damaged 
                  Top broken (greater than 50 percent of live crown gone in hardwoods or greater than 30 percent of live crown gone in pine) 
                  Mechanical damage to main stem (greater than 30 percent of bark circumference affected) 
                  (2)	Class II damage: 
                  Top broken (less than 50 percent of live crown gone in hardwoods or less than 30 percent of live crown gone in pine) 
                  Hardwoods with less than 50 percent of live branches broken or damaged 
                  Pines with less than 30 percent of live branches broken or damaged 
                  Stagheading (dead branches) 
                  (3)	Class III damage: 
                  Lightning strike, hardwoods (less than 30 percent of bark circumference affected) 
                  Foliage destroyed 
                  Twigs and small branches blown off or broken 
                  Mechanical damage to main stem (less than 30 percent of bark circumference affected) 
                  (e)	Treatment of damage shall include the minimization of stress, watering, waiting one growing season to fertilize and prune, watching for pest attack and initiating tree replacement and a planting enrichment program.

                  (A)	Continuance. A lawful conforming use existing prior to the effective date of this chapter may be continued, except as hereafter provided, even though such use does not conform with the provisions of this chapter. 
                  (B)	Extension and alteration. A nonconforming use shall not be extended or structurally altered, but the extension of a lawful nonconforming use throughout all portions of a building or structure existing at the effective date of this chapter shall not be considered as the extension of a nonconforming use. 
                  (C)	Restoration to a safe condition. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the restoration of any building or structure to a safe or sanitary condition when required by the proper authorities. 
                  (D)	Restoration after damage. No building which houses a nonconforming use which has been destroyed or damaged by fire, explosion, act of God, or by public enemy to the extent of 75 percent of its market value—exclusive of the foundation at the time such damage occurred—shall thereafter be made to conform with the provisions of this chapter. If such damage is less than 75 percent of its market value before said damage occurred, exclusive of the foundation, then such structure may be restored to the same nonconforming use as existed before such damage; provided however, that a building permit to initiate restoration be obtained within 12 months of the occurrence of damage; otherwise all provisions of this chapter will apply. However, the City Council may grant an extension of this six-month provision upon their discretion. 
                  (E)	Abandonment. A nonconforming use which has been discontinued for a period of one year shall not be established and any future use shall be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.

                  (G)	Uncompleted structures. If a permitted construction project remains dormant for a period beyond six months, the building permit and all other permits become null and void. The owner of such uncompleted structure may maintain the structure in its existing condition for up to 12 months while awaiting new permits. If the applicant does not receive the necessary permits within the 12-month period, the owner will be required to remove the uncompleted structure, unless they request from the City Planner a time extension to complete the project. 
                  (H)	Errors and violations. The issuance or granting of a permit or approval of plans and/or specifications shall not be deemed or construed to be approval for any violation of any provision in this chapter.

                  It is hereby found and determined that: 
                  (1)	Trees are proven producers of oxygen, a necessary element for survival of mankind; 
                  (2)	Trees appreciably reduce the ever-increasing and environmentally dangerous carbon dioxide content of the air and play a vital role in purifying the air; 
                  (3)	Trees play an important role in the hydrologic cycle, transpiring considerable amounts of water each day, thereby precipitating dust and other particulate airborne pollutants from the air; 
                  (4)	Trees play an important role in neutralizing waste water which passes through the ground from the surface to ground water tables and lower aquifers; 
                  (5)	Trees, through their root systems, stabilize the soil and play in important and effective part in city-wide soil conservation, erosion control and flood control; 
                  (6)	Trees are an invaluable physical and psychological addition to the city, making life more comfortable by providing shade and cooling both air and land, reducing noise levels and glare, and breaking the visual monotony of development on the land; 
                  (7)	Trees provide wildlife habitat and play other important ecological roles; 
                  (8)	The protection of trees within the City is not only desirable, but essential to the present and future health, safety, and welfare of all the citizens; 
                  (9)	Some trees are more beneficial than others as necessary contributors to the City's environment and it is not necessary to protect each and every tree in order to attain the public benefit of a tree protection ordinance; 
                  (10)	Trees have a useable life period and reach old age and die at various ages depending upon the severity of site stresses.

                  The Tree Administrator or other designated staff member will assess damaged trees and prioritize public safety concerns by the tree damage classifications. 
                  CONTINGENCY TABLE 
                  Good storm damage management is the removal of fallen, heavily damaged, hazardous, and soon to be hazardous trees. Good storm damage management is much more cost effective over the long run than cleaning up fallen materials now and reacting to tree calls in the future. While equipment and personnel are available, treat all trees in need. 
                  Storm damaged tree evaluations should be performed by a trained urban forester/arborist before or at the time of initial tree crew attack. Minimizing liability risks, protecting community assets (including trees), and/or better management of community asset appreciation are the primary reasons for any treatment. 
                  Prioritize tree work by public safety concerns and tree damage class.

                  Sec. 90-172. - Districts shown on maps. 
                  The boundaries of the various districts are shown on a Zoning Map of Rincon, which is located in the office of the city hall. The Zoning Map of the incorporated area is hereby made a part of this chapter; and all notations, references, and other information shown thereon shall be as much a part of this chapter as if all the matter and information set forth by said maps were fully described herein.

                  Sec. 90-173. - Interpretation of zoning district boundaries. 
                  When uncertainty exists with respect to the location of boundaries of any zoning district as shown on the Zoning Map of the City of Rincon, the following rules shall apply: 
                  (A)	Unless otherwise specifically indicated, where district boundaries are indicated on the Zoning Map as approximately following the center line of a street, highway, railroad right-of-way line, stream bed or river bed or such center lines extended, then such center lines shall be construed to be such district boundaries. 
                  (B)	Where district boundaries are indicated on the Zoning Map as approximately following the corporate limits line of the city, then such corporate limits line shall be construed to be such district boundaries. 
                  (C)	Where district boundaries are indicated on the Zoning Map as being set back from a street, road, highway, railroad, stream or river and parallel thereto, then such district boundaries, unless otherwise specifically indicated, shall be construed as being at the scaled distance from the center line of such street, road, highway, railroad, stream or river and as being parallel thereto. 
                  (D)	Where a district boundary divides a lot, the requirements for the district in which the greater portion of the lot lies shall be extended to the balance of the lot; provided, however, that such extension shall not include any part of such lot which lies more than 50 feet beyond the district boundary; and provided further, that this provision shall not apply to a through lot. In the case of a through lot, the restriction of the district applying to adjoining lots which front on the same street as the lot frontage in question shall apply.

                  Sec. 90-174. - Conditional uses. 
                  Within each zoning district a particular list of land uses are set aside from the uses permitted by right.

                  It shall be unlawful for any person to commence excavation for, or construction of any building or structure, or moving of any existing building or structure without first obtaining a permit from the Building and Zoning Department. No permit shall be issued for the construction or alteration of any building or structure until proper approval has been granted and fees have been submitted in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 

                  Sec. 90-331. - Permits required for construction. 
                  The following is a list of permits needed for construction of a building or structure or the movement of a building or structure that may be needed for any type of land development in the City of Rincon, Georgia. 
                  (A)	Building permit. A building permit issued by the Building and Zoning Department is required in advance of the initiation of construction, erection, moving or alteration of any building or structure. All applications for building permits shall be accompanied by a plat or plan in duplicate, drawn to scale, showing the actual dimensions of the lot to be built upon, the size of the building to be erected, the location of the building on the lot, the number of dwelling units the design is to accommodate, and such other information as may be essential for determining whether the provisions of this chapter are being observed. A record of such application and plats or plans shall be kept by the Building and Zoning Department. A building permit is also required for swimming pools, and lawn irrigation systems. 
                  (B)	Relocation permit. A relocation permit is required anytime a manufactured home, mobile home, trailer, out building, house or structure is moved from any location to any lot or parcel within the city limits of Rincon. Electrical, mechanical and plumbing permits are included within this permit. Buildings used for the purpose of storage only with no need for electricity or plumbing are exempt from this requirement. 
                  (C)	Sign permit. Prior to the erection of a sign for either on premises or off premises advertising, the Building and Zoning Department must first issue a permit in accordance with the sign regulations set forth in the City of Rincon Sign Ordinance. Permits are required for both temporary signs as well as permanent signs. 
                  (D)	Demolition permit. Prior to destruction of a building, structure, or sign, a demolition permit is needed. Such permit may be attained from the Building and Zoning Department. 
                  (E)	Electrical permit. An electrical permit is needed before installing any electrical wiring or fixtures. This permit is not needed if a re-location permit or building permit has already been issued on the structure. 
                  (F)	Plumbing permit. A plumbing permit is needed whenever a plumber installs a new plumbing system in an existing structure. This permit is not needed if a re-location permit or building permit has already been issued on the structure. 
                  (G)	Mechanical permit. A mechanical permit is needed before a licensed installer may install any mechanical device such as a heating and/or cooling system for air or water. This permit is not needed if a re-location permit or building permit has already been issued on the structure. 
                  (H)	Subdivision of land. Whenever a lot, parcel, or tract of land is divided into two or more parts, the owner must submit a preliminary subdivision plat to the Building and Zoning Department. The preliminary plat shall be reviewed at a public meeting held by the Planning and Zoning Board and then by the City Council at a public hearing to follow. 
                  Once the preliminary plat is approved by City Council, required infrastructure improvements may be permitted on the property. After the required infrastructure improvements are completed and inspected by the Building and Zoning Department, a final plat may be submitted to the City Planner. 
                  The final plat shall be reviewed at a public meeting held by the Planning and Zoning Board and then by the City Council at a public hearing to follow. Once the final plat is approved by the City Council, all parcels created by the subdivision may be recorded in the Office of the Superior Court of Effingham County and subsequently become real estate. 
                  Subdivisions of three lots or less may be considered a minor subdivision where the preliminary and final plat procedures are combined into one. However, subdivisions of four lots and more or any division where infrastructure improvements are required will be considered as major subdivisions and must endure the complete process.

                  Sec. 90-332. - Permits or actions required by this chapter. 
                  The following are permits that may be required depending on the construction and particular land use district for which it will take place: 
                  (A)	Conditional use permits. There are specific land uses permitted in certain zoning districts only after a review by the Planning and Zoning Board, a public hearing has been held by the City Council, and the City Council has determined that the use is appropriate based on certain criteria. These uses are listed throughout article IV and the criteria is listed in section 7 of this article. 
                  (B)	Site plan approval. All land development activities other than residential one- and two-family structures, regardless of the zoning district, must present a site plan of such development to the Building and Zoning Department and City Engineer for review prior to the issuance of any land development permits. The site plan is also reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Board and forwarded to the City Council for approval once all comments are addressed. 
                  (C)	Zoning variance. Where strict enforcement of this chapter may present an unnecessary hardship upon a lot or parcel of land, the owner may apply for a zoning variance. Such action requires a public meeting by the Planning and Zoning Board and approval by the City Council at a scheduled public hearing. 
                  (D)	Amendment to the zoning map. An amendment to the zoning map is considered to be an amendment to the zoning ordinance. Such action requires a public meeting by the Planning and Zoning Board and approval by the City Council at a scheduled public hearing. 
                  (E)	Amendment to the text of this chapter. An amendment to the text of the zoning ordinance follows the same process as an amendment to the zoning map. However, a text amendment requires different materials to be included with the application. 
                  (F)	Permits required in conjunction with permits in this chapter. The following are permits required by other government entities that may be applicable to a development project in Rincon. 
                  (G)	Land-disturbing activity permit. Under the Georgia Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Act, any disturbance of land of over 1 1/10 of an acre requires a land disturbance permit from the Building and Zoning Department. 
                  (H)	Construction in wetlands.

                  Sec. 90-335. - Public notice. 
                  After a completed application has been filed, the next step in the approval process for a zoning action required by this chapter is to set a date for a public hearing on the matter and render proper notice to the public. Proper public hearing notice procedures are as follows: 
                  (A)	Legal notice. Notice of public meetings before the Planning and Zoning Board and public hearings before City Council as required by this section shall be published within a newspaper of general circulation within the city in which are carried the legal advertisements of the City and shall state the time, place and purpose of the hearing and shall also include the location of property that is the subject of the zoning action, the present zoning district of said property, and the proposed zoning district or proposed zoning action of said property. Such notice for the official public hearing before the City Council shall be published at least 15 days; but, not more than 45 days prior to the date of the hearing. 
                  (B)	Signs posted. Where a zoning action of property is initiated, a designated official of the city shall post a sign at least 15 days prior to the City Council Public Hearing, in a conspicuous place on the property for which an application for a proposed zoning action has been submitted. The sign or signs will contain information as to the current zoning district, the proposed zoning district or zoning action, and the date, time and location of the public meetings before the Planning and Zoning Board and the public hearing before City Council. 
                  (C)	Notification to adjacent property owners. At least seven days prior, but not more than 45 days before the date of the public hearing a notice setting forth the date, time and place for such public hearing shall be sent by mail to the applicant, the planning and zoning commission, and all owners of property located within 300 feet from the property being proposed for rezoning. The notice shall also include the location of the property, its present zoning classification and the proposed zoning classification. The names and addresses of owners of such properties to be notified shall be provided by the applicant as set forth herein; provided, however, where a map amendment is initiated by the Planning and Zoning Board such names and addresses of owners of property located adjacent to or across a public right-of-way from property being proposed for rezoning shall be provided by the Building and Zoning Department. Failure of the Building and Zoning Department to send notices or failure of the property owner to receive notification shall not affect the validity of any zoning action. This procedure exists as a supplement to the legally required notification procedures. 
                  ( Ord. of 8-23-10 ) 
                  Sec. 90-336. - Public hearing requirements. 
                  Whenever a zoning action takes place, a hearing must be held before the public. When an applicant requires more than one zoning action or subdivision procedure for a development project, a separate Public Hearing must be held for each procedure or action. A public meeting is held by the Planning and Zoning Board and a public hearing is held before City Council. The public hearing before the City Council is by record the official public hearing. The purpose of each public hearing is to discuss information pertinent to the particular action or procedure. During the hearing the following rules and actions shall be followed: 
                  (A)	General rules of conduct. Whenever a public hearing is required by this chapter or by state law prior to approving a zoning action, such public hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the following procedures: 
                  (1)	The public hearing shall be called to order by the presiding officer. 
                  (2)	The presiding officer shall explain the procedures to be followed in the conduct of the public hearing. 
                  (3)	If the subject of the hearing is initiated by an applicant other than the City Council, the petitioner requesting such zoning decision, or the applicant's agent, shall be recognized first and shall be permitted to present and explain the request for the zoning decision. Thereafter, all individuals who so desire shall be permitted to speak in favor or in opposition of the proposed zoning decision. 
                  (4)	If the request is initiated by the City Council, all members of the City Council shall be allowed to speak as they are recognized by the mayor or presiding officer, regardless of whether such City Council member speaks in favor of or in opposition to the proposed zoning decision. Thereafter, all individuals who so desire shall be permitted to speak in favor or in opposition of the proposed zoning decision. 
                  (5)	When any person wishes to speak at a public hearing, he shall raise his hand and, after being recognized by the presiding officer, shall stand and give his name, address, and make any comment appropriate to the proposed zoning decision. If within two years immediately preceding the filing of the applicant's application for a zoning action, the speaker has made campaign contributions aggregating to more than $100.01 to any member of the City Council or any member of the City Planning and Zoning Board, it shall be the duty of the speaker to disclose the following information five days prior to the official public hearing: 
                  a.	The name of the local government official to whom the campaign contribution or gift was made; 
                  b.	The dollar amount of each campaign contribution made by the applicant to the local government official during the two years immediately preceding the filing of the application for the map amendment and the date of each contribution; and 
                  c.	An enumeration and description of each gift having a value of $100.01 or more made by the applicant to the local government official during the two years immediately preceding the filing of the application for the zoning action. 
                  (6)	Reserved. 
                  (7)	A time limit may be imposed upon any person speaking at a public hearing, but all speakers are urged to make their comments brief and avoid repeating other comments. 
                  (8)	The applicant shall have an opportunity, after all comments in opposition have been made, to make summary remarks concerning the proposed zoning decision. 
                  (9)	Thereafter, the presiding officer shall announce that the public hearing for the requested zoning decision is closed, and the City Council or the Planning and Zoning Board, as the case may be, shall immediately and openly discuss the proposed zoning decision and vote on action which they are authorized to take. 
                  (B)	Actions specific to the Planning and Zoning Board during a public meeting. In all zoning actions in the City of Rincon, the Planning and Zoning Board is a recommending body and all final decisions must be made by the City Council. However, the Planning and Zoning Board has an important role in the public hearing process. This role is as follows: 
                  (1)	All proposed zoning actions shall be reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Board in a public meeting in accordance with the procedures set in this chapter. 
                  (2)	The Planning and Zoning Board shall review and consider a recommendation to the City Council with respect to the application for a zoning action. The Planning and Zoning Board may decide to make no recommendation or it may make any of the following recommendations with respect to an application for a zoning action: approval, denial, deferral, withdrawal without prejudice, reduction of the land area for which the application is made, change of the zoning district requested, or imposition of zoning conditions; and 
                  (3)	The Planning and Zoning Board shall submit its recommendation on a zoning action application to the City Council prior to the scheduled Public Hearing in which the City Council will consider the application for a zoning decision. If the Planning and Zoning Board fails to submit a recommendation prior to the public hearing, the Planning and Zoning Board's recommendation shall be deemed one of approval. 
                  (C)	Actions specific to the City Council during a public hearing. 
                  (1)	Before taking action on a proposed amendment and after receipt of the Planning and Zoning Board recommendations and reports thereon, the City Council shall hold a public hearing on the proposed amendment at their next scheduled meeting. 
                  (2)	So that the purpose of this zoning ordinance will be served and so that health, public safety and general welfare will be secured, the City Council may in its legislative discretion: 
                  a.	Approve or deny the proposed zoning action as submitted; 
                  b.	Reduce the land area for which the application is made; 
                  c.	Change the zoning district to one other than that requested; or 
                  d.	Add or delete zoning conditions as the City Council deems appropriate. 
                  (3)	An action to defer a decision on the proposed amendment shall include a specific meeting date to which the proposed amendment is deferred. The City Council may also approve a withdrawal of an application, and if so stipulated by the City Council in its decision to approve withdrawal, the 12-month limitation on re-filing of the application for the same property shall not apply. 
                  (D)	Public hearings records standards. The City Clerk or an agent of the City Clerk shall mechanically record the proceedings of all zoning public hearings. If requested by any party, verbatim transcripts of the public hearing can be prepared, but only if requested and purchased in advance by the requesting party, who must arrange at his expense for a certified court reporter to record and transcribe the hearing and furnish the original of the transcript to the City Council for its records. The record of the public hearing and all evidence (e.g., maps, drawings, traffic studies, etc.) submitted at the public hearing shall be noted as such and shall become a permanent part of the particular zoning action's file. 
                  ( Ord. of 8-23-10 ) 
                  Sec. 90-337. - Standards for conditional use permission. 
                  Land uses listed in this chapter that are permitted as conditional uses must follow an administrative procedure prior to the issuance of any land development permit. 
                  (A)	Review criteria. The Planning and Zoning Board shall hear and make recommendation upon such uses in a district that are permitted as conditional uses. The application to establish such use shall be approved by the City Council on a finding that: 
                  (1)	The proposed use will not be contrary to the purpose of this chapter, 
                  (2)	The proposed use will not be detrimental to the use or development of adjacent properties or the general neighborhood or adversely affect the health and safety of residents and workers, 
                  (3)	The proposed use will not constitute a nuisance or hazard because of the number of persons who will attend or use such facility, vehicular movement acquainted with the use, noise or fumes generated by or as a result of the use, or type of physical activity associated with the land use, 
                  (4)	The proposed use will not be affected adversely by the existing uses of adjacent properties, 
                  (5)	The proposed use will be placed on a lot which is of sufficient size to satisfy the space requirements of said use, 
                  (6)	The parking and all development standards set forth for each particular use for which a permit may be granted will be met, and 
                  (7)	The action will not adversely impact adjacent or nearby properties in terms of property values, by rendering such properties less suitable and therefore less marketable for the type of development to which they are committed or restricted in order to promote the public welfare and protect the established development pattern. 
                  (B)	Additional mitigation requirements. The Planning and Zoning Board may suggest and the City Council may impose or require such additional restrictions and standards (e.g., increased setbacks, buffer strips, screening, etc.): 
                  (1)	As may be necessary to protect the health and safety of workers and residents in the community; 
                  (2)	To protect the value and use of property in the general neighborhood; and 
                  (3)	To provide continuity and consistency in the character, architectural design, and physical layout of an area. 
                  (C)	Adherence to requirements. Provided that wherever the City Council shall find in the case of any permit granted pursuant to the provisions of these regulations, noncompliance of any term, condition, or restrictions upon which such permit was granted, the City Council shall rescind and revoke such permit after giving due notice to all parties concerned and granting full opportunity for a public hearing. 
                  (D)	Permit longevity. Conditional use permission granted by the City Council shall be valid for a period of 12 months from date of approval. Such approval is based on information provided in the application. Building permits may only be granted for plans consistent with the approved application. Any deviation from the information submitted will require separate approval by City Council. 
                  ( Ord. of 8-23-10 ) 
                  Sec. 90-338. - Site plan approval. 
                  The site plan approval process is intended to provide the general public, Planning and Zoning Board and City Council with information pertinent to how a new development will affect the surrounding area and the city as a whole. Site plan approval does not constitute approval of any other zoning action or permit. 
                  (A)	Process. Upon submittal of the site plan, the Building and Zoning Department will review the site plan for noticeable discrepancies and determine if there is a need to apply for other zoning actions. The site plan is then forwarded to the City Engineer. Once the engineer has submitted comments to the Building and Zoning Department, the site plan shall be placed on the agenda of the next Planning and Zoning Board meeting. Until the applicant addresses all of staff's comments and the site plan is satisfactory, the City Council will not approve the plan. However, once the first public meeting is held before the Planning and Zoning Board, site plan approval may commence at any scheduled meeting of the City Council. 
                  (B)	Zoning actions. Once a site plan has met the application and process requirements the necessary zoning action process may begin.

                  Sec. 90-339. - Variances. 
                  (A)	Standards. After an application has been submitted to the Building and Zoning Department, reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Board, and a public hearing has been held by the City Council, the City Council may grant a variance from the strict application of the provisions in this chapter only if at least two of the following findings are made: 
                  (1)	That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions beyond that of surrounding properties, including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of the lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions, peculiar to the particular property, 
                  (2)	That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, the property cannot be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the zoning ordinance, without undue hardship to the property, 
                  (3)	That granting the variance will not result in authorization of a use not otherwise permitted in the district in which the property is located or cause substantial detriment to the public good. 
                  (B)	Height variances. For residential height variances the petitioner shall be required to add two feet to each side yard set back for each one foot above 50 feet in height and have safe guards consisting of sprinkler systems, smoke detectors and any other fire protection equipment deemed necessary at the time by City Council. Where a rear yard abuts a side yard of the adjacent lot, the petitioner shall be required to add two feet to the rear setback for each foot above the 50 feet height, and have safe guards consisting of sprinkler systems, smoke detectors, and any other fire protection deemed necessary at the time by City Council. 
                  (C)	Permit longevity. After a variance has been granted by the City Council it shall be valid for a period of 12 months from date of approval. Such approval is based on information provided in the application. Building permits may only be granted for plans consistent with the approved application. Any deviation from the information submitted will require separate approval by City Council.

                  In order to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of the City of Rincon against the unrestricted use of property, the following standards and any other factors relevant to balancing the above stated public interest will be considered, when deemed appropriate, by the City Council in making any zoning decision: 
                  (A)	Is this request a logical extension of a zoning boundary which would improve the pattern of uses in the general area? 
                  (B)	Is this spot zoning and generally unrelated to either existing zoning or the pattern of development of the area? 
                  (C)	Could traffic created by the proposed use or other uses permissible under the zoning sought traverse established single-family neighborhoods on minor streets, leading to congestion, noise and traffic hazards? 
                  (D)	Will this request place irreversible limitations on the area as it is or on future plans for it? 
                  (E)	Is there an imminent need for the rezoning and is the property likely to be used for the use requested? 
                  (F)	Will the proposed use substantially conflict with existing density patterns in the zone or neighborhood?
