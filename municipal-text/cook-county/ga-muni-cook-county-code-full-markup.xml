        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of Cook County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
                  This 2012 republication includes all amendatory legislation through Ord. of January 7, 2011, and was accomplished under the supervision of D. J. Heath, Editor. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Palmer Carr, Supervising Editor, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

                  The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Faye Hughes, County Administrator, and Ms. Vicki Parrish, County Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.

                  SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
                  The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement.

               To amend Code Section 41-1-7 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to treatment of agricultural facilities and operations as nuisances, so as to change the provisions relating to the declared policy of the state; to provide for additional definitions; to provide an effective date; to repeal conflicting laws; and for other purposes.

When nonagricultural land uses extend into agricultural areas or when there are changed conditions in or around the locality of an agricultural facility, agricultural operations often become the subject of nuisance actions. As a result, agricultural facilities are sometimes forced to cease operations. Many others are discouraged from making investments in farm improvements or adopting new technology or methods. It is the purpose of this Code section to reduce losses of the state's agricultural resources by limiting the circumstances under which agricultural facilities and operations may be deemed to be a nuisance.

               (1)  'Agricultural area' means any land which is, or may be, legally used for an agricultural operation under applicable zoning laws, rules, and regulations at the time of commencement of the agricultural operation of the agricultural facility at issue and throughout the first year of operation of such agricultural facility. Any land which is not subject to zoning laws, rules, and regulations at the time of commencement of an agricultural operation of an agricultural facility and throughout the first year of operation of such agricultural facility shall be deemed an 'agricultural area' for purposes of this Code section. 
               (2)  'Agricultural facility' includes, but is not limited to, any land, building, structure, pond, impoundment, appurtenance, machinery, or equipment which is used for the commercial production or processing of crops, livestock, animals, poultry, honeybees, honeybee products, livestock products, poultry products, or products which are used in commercial aquaculture. Such term shall also include any farm labor camp or facilities for migrant farm workers. 
               (3)  'Agricultural operation' means: 
               (A)  The plowing, tilling, or preparation of soil at an agricultural facility; 
               (B)  The planting, growing, fertilizing, or harvesting of crops; 
               (C)  The application of pesticides, herbicides, or other chemicals, compounds, or substances to crops, weeds, or soil in connection with the production of crops, livestock, animals, or poultry; 
               (D)  The breeding, hatching, raising, producing, feeding, keeping, slaughtering, or processing of livestock, hogs, equines, chickens, turkeys, poultry or other fowl normally raised for food, mules, cattle, sheep, goats, dogs [hogs], rabbits, or similar farm animals for commercial purposes; 
               (E)  The production and keeping of honeybees, the production of honeybee products, and honeybee processing facilities; 
               (F)  The production, processing, or packaging of eggs or egg products; 
               (G)  The manufacturing of feed for poultry or livestock; 
               (H)  The rotation of crops; 
               (I)  Commercial aquaculture; 
               (J)  The application of existing, changed, or new technology, practices, processes, or procedures to any agricultural operation; and 
               (K)  The operation of any roadside market.

Pursuant to resolutions of the board of commissioners of Tift, Turner and Worth counties, adopted March 28, 1995, and March 20, 1995 (the "Original Resolutions"), the Tift-Turner-Worth Joint Development Authority (the "joint authority") was activated.

                  (g)  Adding Cook County as participant.

                  (k)  Membership.

                  (m)  Duties, powers and responsibilities.

                  (n)  Effect of authority's creation on other corporations or authorities.

Adequate records shall be kept at the county commissioners' office for examination by the county clerk at that officer's discretion. If, after examination of the books or records, it is determined that a deficiency occurs as a result of underreporting, a penalty of ten percent per month times the amount deficient will be assessed for the period delinquent.

                  In addition to the other remedies provided in this article for the collection of occupation tax levied in this article, the county clerk, upon any tax if such tax becomes delinquent and remains unpaid, shall issue execution for the correct amount of the tax against the persons, partnership or corporation liable for such tax, which execution shall bear interest of ten percent per annum from the date when such tax or installment becomes delinquent. The lien shall cover the property in the county of the person, partnership or corporation liable for the tax, all as provided by the ordinances of the county and the laws of the state. The lien of such occupation tax shall become fixed on the date from the time when such tax or any installment thereof becomes delinquent. The execution shall be levied by the county clerk upon the property of defendant located in such jurisdiction, and sufficient property shall be advertised and sold to pay the amount of the execution, with interest and costs. All other proceedings in relation thereto shall be had as is provided by ordinances of the county and the laws of the state. The defendant in such execution shall have rights of defense, by affidavit of illegality and otherwise, which are provided by the applicable laws in regard to tax executions. When a nulla bona entry has been entered by proper authority upon an execution issued by the clerk against any person defaulting on the occupation tax, the person against whom the entry was made shall not be allowed or entitled to have or collect any fees or charges whatsoever for services rendered after the entry of the nulla bona. If, at any time after the entry of nulla bona has been made, the person against whom the execution issues pays the tax in full, together with all interest and costs accrued on the tax, the person may collect any fees and charges due him as though he had never defaulted in the payment of the taxes.

Such amendment may increase or lower the amounts and tax rates of any occupation and may change the classification thereof. The payment of any occupation tax provided for shall not be construed as prohibiting the levy or collection by the jurisdiction of additional occupation taxes upon the same person, property or business.

                  ARTICLE III. - SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES 

                  Sec. 22-91. - Rationale and findings. 
                  (a)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of the county, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses within the county. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. 
                  (b)  Rationale. Based on evidence of the adverse secondary effects of adult uses presented in hearings and in reports made available to the board of commissioners, and on findings, interpretations and narrowing constructions incorporated in the cases of:

                  (4)  Based upon reports concerning secondary effects occurring in and around sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, Austin, Texas - 1986; Indianapolis, Indiana - 1984; Garden Grove, California - 1991; Houston, Texas - 1983, 1997; Phoenix, Arizona - 1979, 1995-98; Chattanooga, Tennessee - 1999-2003; Minneapolis, Minnesota - 1980; Los Angeles, California - 1977; Whittier, California - 1978; Spokane, Washington - 2001; St. Cloud, Minnesota - 1994; Littleton, Colorado - 2004; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma - 1986; Dallas, Texas - 1997; Greensboro, North Carolina - 2003; Amarillo, Texas - 1977; New York, New York Times Square - 1994; and the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group on The Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota). 
                  (c)  Findings. The board of commissioners find: 
                  (1)  Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on property values, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. 
                  (2)  Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from certain land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses and the surrounding area, and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area. 
                  (3)  Each of the negative secondary effects set forth in subsection (c)(1) and (2) of this section constitutes a harm which the county has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the county's rationale for this article, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the county's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the county. The county finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this article are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.

                  (e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Code, a nonconforming sexually oriented business that is in all respects legally existing and operating prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, may continue to operate for two years following that date in order to make a reasonable recoupment of its investment in its current location. At the conclusion of said two years, the use will no longer be recognized as a lawful nonconforming use, provided that a nonconforming sexually oriented business may apply for one or more six-month extensions of the original two-year period upon a showing financial hardship.

                  Trout streams: All streams or portions of streams within the watershed as designated by the Wildlife Resources Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources under the provisions of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, O.C.G.A. 12-5-20, in the rules and regulations for Water Quality Control, Chapter 391-3-6 at www.gaepd.org. Streams designated as primary trout waters are defined as water supporting a self- sustaining population of rainbow, brown or brook trout. Streams designated as secondary trout waters are those in which there is no evidence of natural trout reproduction, but are capable of supporting trout throughout the year. First order trout waters are streams into which no other streams flow except springs. 
                  Vegetative erosion and sedimentation control measures: Measures for the stabilization of erodible or sediment-producing areas by covering the soil with: 
                  (1)  Permanent seeding, sprigging or planting, producing long-term vegetative cover; or 
                  (2)  Temporary seeding, producing short-term vegetative cover; or 
                  (3)  Sodding, covering areas with a turf of perennial sod-forming grass. 
                  Such measures can be found in the publication Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia. 
                  Watercourse: Any natural or artificial watercourse, stream, river, creek, channel, ditch, canal, conduit, culvert, drain, waterway, gully, ravine, or wash in which water flows either continuously or intermittently and which has a definite channel, bed and banks, and including any area adjacent thereto subject to inundation by reason of overflow or floodwater. 
                  Wetlands: Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.

                  (Ord. of 7-18-2016, § III) 
                  Sec. 30-39. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this ordinance shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6 subsection (b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in C.15,16 and 17, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et. seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et. seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 30-39(b)(2); 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to O.C.G.A part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (17)  There is established a 25 foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  d.  Activities where the area within the for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  e.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et. seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsection 30-39(b) and (c). 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create, a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. of 7-18-2016, § IV) 
                  Sec. 30-40. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of Cook County without first obtaining a permit from the Cook County Building/Zoning Department to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the county building/zoning department and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection 30-40(c). Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of Subsection 30-39(b)and (c) will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. 12-7-8 half of such fees levied. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by Subsection 30-39(c)(15), (16) and (17) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection 30-40(b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations.

                  DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

                  Sec. 34-31. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.

                  Sec. 34-32. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  (1)  Protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this article. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
                  Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) (as corrected in 1929) means a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced after April 3, 1996 and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, the term "new construction" means structures for which the start of construction commenced after April 3, 1996 and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after April 3, 1996. 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA flood modernization maps. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
                  (1)  Built on a single chassis; 
                  (2)  400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
                  (3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and 
                  (4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use. 
                  Start of construction means the date the building permit was issued, provided that the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erecting of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds nor occupied as dwelling units or part of a main structure. (Note: accessory structures are not exempt from any article requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration or improvements to a building taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the start of construction of the improvement. Note. The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. The term "substantial improvement" includes structures, which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include: 
                  (1)  Those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the Code Enforcement Official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project; or 
                  (2)  Any alteration of an historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  DIVISION 3. - FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 34-91. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure. 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
                  (3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the lowest floor criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces; 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
                  (Ord. of 4-15-1996, art. 4, § A; Ord. of 9-8-2009, art. 4, § A) 
                  Sec. 34-92. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including the basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with the standards of section 34-91(4), elevated buildings. All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation provided that all areas of the structure below one foot above the base flood elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, are designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions in this subsection, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth in this subsection and in section 34-68(7). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: 
                  1.  Individual lots or parcels; 
                  2.  In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions; 
                  3.  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or 
                  4.  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood; 
                  must have the lowest floor including the basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to the adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Reference section 34-91(6).) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (3)c of this section. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 34-36, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted, however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection(4)a of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division.

                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the county board of commissioners may appeal such decision to the county superior court, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that the criteria of this division are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued when any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the county board of commissioners shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances are as follows: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. In the instance of an historic structure, a determination shall be made that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The building/zoning administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed in subsection (h) of this section and the purposes of this article, the county board of commissioners may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  Sec. 58-51. - Preapplication procedure. 
                  (a)  The subdivider may visit with the county staff and discuss the effect of the comprehensive plan, the major thoroughfare plan and other official plans on the proposed subdivision, as well as general design standards, zoning, and related matters. 
                  (b)  The subdivider may submit preapplication plans and data for review, advice and assistance by the road superintendent, county engineer and the county health department. Professional assistance at this early stage may save time and effort during later steps. 
                  (c)  Preapplication plans and data should include: 
                  (1)  Location sketch map, showing site in relation to the section of the county in which it is located. 
                  (2)  A simple sketch plan on a topographic survey showing general layout of lots, streets, major drainage ways and other features in relation to existing conditions on the site and the surrounding street system. 
                  (3)  General subdivision information including data on proposed or existing covenants, wooded areas, available and proposed community facilities, and utilities, typical lot size, etc., and land characteristics as defined. 
                  (d)  Subdivisions shall be officially reviewed in the four stages as described in this article. 
                  (Ord. of 7-7-1997, art. IV) 
                  Sec. 58-52. - Preliminary plat. 
                  (a)  Purpose. The purpose of the preliminary plat is to safeguard the subdivider from unnecessary loss of time and expense in preparation of a subdivision plat which does not conform with the specifications of this chapter. The preliminary plat requires only approximate accuracy of scale and dimension. Public reviewing agencies having jurisdiction, including but not limited to the county health department, county engineer, county road superintendent, and the appropriate municipality, if applicable, will review preliminary plats regarding matters within their jurisdiction. During the review process, the subdivider or his agent may be called upon for consultation. 
                  (b)  Subdivisions requiring no new street, water or sewer facilities. All subdivisions which do not involve the platting, construction, or opening of new streets, water or sewer facilities may be accepted by the building and zoning official in the form of a final plat, provided that essential data required by the reviewing agencies to ensure compliance with the intent of this chapter is submitted. 
                  (c)  Filing. Any person desiring to subdivide land shall file with the building and zoning official five copies of the preliminary plat accompanied by a letter of application. The letter of application shall contain the name and address of the developers and his agents, the zoning of the property to be subdivided, whether or not the subdivision will be developed in phases, plans for potential annexation, and plans for serving the proposed subdivision with sewer and water facilities. The plat shall be prepared in accordance with this chapter and with applicable county specifications by a registered land surveyor, who is licensed under the laws of the state. The preliminary plat shall be deemed filed with the county when it is filed with the building and zoning official. At the time of filing, a certificate of filing shall be provided to the subdivider and shall include the time and date of filing. Filing of the preliminary plat shall be accomplished at least 15 working days prior to the regular planning commission meeting at which it is to be considered. The preliminary plat shall include: 
                  (1)  Title block and north arrow. The preliminary plat will show the name of the proposed subdivision, its location, the name, address and registration number of the surveyor preparing the plat and the date of the plat. A north arrow shall be included with a notation referencing the bearings to magnetic north, astronomical north or grid north. 
                  (2)  General layout. The preliminary plat shall show information as to the proposed street layout and widths, layout of lots with a notation as to the minimum size and width of lots and any proposed open space. Any lands to be dedicated will be clearly identified. Plat scale, total acreage of the site and total number of lots created shall also be indicated. Lot and block identification and building setback lines shall also be indicated. 
                  (3)  Topography. The plat shall show existing contour lines dashed and any proposed contour lines solid, both set of lines to be at two-foot intervals, mean sea level (MSL). Prominent drainage features such as lakes, depressions, streams, etc., which could affect the design of the subdivision shall be shown. Engineering data showing the high water elevation and how it was established shall be submitted with the plat. This may be best accomplished by utilization of the county flood hazard boundary maps. Any identified flood hazard area shall be clearly indicated on the plat. 
                  (4)  Existing features. The preliminary plat shall show the locations and names of existing and platted property lines, streets (and its right-of-way), railroads (and its right-of-way), public and private rights-of-ways, sanitary sewer (and size), water mains (and size), bridges, culverts, storm drainage (and size), easements, parks and other public open spaces. Land lot and land district lines, and names of adjoining property owners or subdivisions shall also be indicated. Floodplain areas, as identified on officially adopted county maps, and any wetlands areas, as identified on draft U.S. Department of the Interior National Wetlands Inventory Maps, shall be clearly delineated. 
                  (5)  Location map. The preliminary plat shall include a small scale map of sufficient clarity so that the location of the proposed subdivision can be readily determined. 
                  (6)  Water and sewer. A statement from the subdivider shall be submitted with the preliminary plat which will describe the method by which sewage disposal and water facilities will be provided. If private sewer is proposed to serve a subdivision, then soils will be identified according to local soil conservation service soil maps (see section 58-3) and soils percolation test results and contour map shall accompany the preliminary plat at the time of submission. The contour map shall show location and identification of each soil class and site of each percolation test. Percolation tests shall be made in accordance with county health department requirements. If public water or sewer are proposed, a letter from the providing jurisdiction shall accompany the submittals. 
                  (7)  Future tract plan. In cases where a subdivision is to be developed in stages with additional plats being filed with the planning commission at a later date, the filing of the initial plat will be accompanied by a future tract plan, a reasonably accurate plat in sketch form of the entire tract which will show the future street system and topography for the entire tract. Once the required tract plan has been given approval by the planning commission, five copies of the approved future tract plan must be provided for distribution to the various reviewing agencies and the inspections office. 
                  (8)  Soil erosion control. A soil erosion control plan, prepared in accordance with the county soil erosion and sedimentation control ordinance's latest revisions, shall be submitted to the county building and zoning official simultaneous with the improvement plan. (See section 58-53.) 
                  (9)  Wetlands. Approximate location of wetlands boundaries shall be delineated on the preliminary plat. All preliminary plats delineating wetlands shall have on the face of the preliminary plat the note: "No fill or work shall be permitted within jurisdictional wetlands without a prior permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers." All minimum lot areas per designated zoning classification requirements shall be calculated upland of any wetlands boundaries within or contiguous to the project. 
                  (d)  Completeness. If any of the information required by subsection (c) of this section is omitted or misrepresented on the plat, the county building and zoning official may refuse to review the plat and shall return the plat to the subdivider to be completed or revised. The plat, upon revision, may be resubmitted as a new preliminary plat. 
                  (e)  Approval by individual agencies. No preliminary plat shall be approved by the planning commission unless it is approved by the county engineer, road superintendent and the board of health. Such agencies shall, with or without modification, approve the preliminary plat to the extent that each has jurisdiction. If the plat is rejected, the respective reviewing agency shall provide the planning commission with a written statement specifying all aspects where the plat fails to comply. 
                  (f)  Coordination. Upon receipt of the filing of the preliminary plat, the building and zoning official shall prepare the submitted materials for review by the appropriate agencies. The various agencies shall complete their reports in a timely fashion, and shall submit their findings to the planning commission for review and approval. It shall be the responsibility of the building and zoning official to coordinate these reviews and to ensure reports are brought together in a timely fashion for proper presentation to the planning commission. 
                  (g)  Approval by planning commission. Approval or disapproval of the preliminary plat shall be accomplished within 30 days after the plat is filed with the planning commission. If after 30 days the planning commission has failed to act, the preliminary plat shall be deemed approved; provided, however, that the subdivider may waive in writing this requirement and consent to an extension of such period. If the preliminary plat is disapproved, the reasons therefore shall be stated in the resolution disapproving the same, and the subdivider shall be so informed. 
                  (h)  Approval duration. Approved preliminary plats are valid for one year only from the date of approval. If the final plat or improvement plan has not been submitted within this time period, preliminary plat approval becomes invalid and must be resubmitted. 
                  (Ord. of 7-7-1997, § 4-1.8) 
                  Sec. 58-53. - Improvement plans. 
                  (a)  General requirements. Subdivision plans receive their second official consideration as improvement plans. These improvement plans shall be approved by the county engineer and road superintendent who shall certify that the improvement plans are in conformance with this chapter, official county specifications, and with the requirements of the approved preliminary plan. No developer shall proceed with any construction work in the proposed subdivision before obtaining this approval from the road superintendent and/or county engineer, which must be in writing. 
                  (b)  Professional engineer required. Should certain design calculations be required to resolve flow problems, possible erosion or drainage problems, or other detailed engineering problems which might be encountered in the process of preparing the required improvement plan, the county engineer shall be authorized to require the developer to obtain services of a qualified registered land surveyor or a professional engineer in the improvement plan design process. Should such services be required, such plans shall reflect his registration. All professional surveying or engineering service costs shall be the sole responsibility of the applicant. 
                  (c)  Filing. To secure formal review and approval of his improvement plans, the developer shall file with the building and zoning official three certified (signed and sealed by the developer's registered surveyor or professional engineer) white background prints of the improvement plans, the building and zoning official will then distribute the improvement plans to the county engineer and road superintendent who shall jointly review the proposed improvement plans and shall approve or deny the proposed improvement plans. The building and zoning official shall notify the planning commission of the action in writing. The review of the improvement plan shall include the review of plans for compliance with the county erosion and sedimentation control chapter, as amended. 
                  (1)  Approval means the developer is now authorized to proceed with the physical improvements in the subdivision, after securing any required construction permits, and may proceed with the preparation of the final subdivision plat. 
                  (2)  Conditional approval means the developer may proceed as outlined in subsection (c)(1) of this section, but only after he submits three certified copies of the corrected improvement plans to the county engineer and road superintendent of their review and approval. 
                  (3)  Denial means disapproval of the improvement plans. For further consideration, the developer must rework his plans to conform to the requirements of this chapter, and then submit the reworked plans to the building and zoning official as though they were a completely new set of plans. 
                  (d)  Plans and data required for submission. The plans for the required minimum improvements shall be prepared and approved by the county engineer and road superintendent prior to construction and only after approval of the preliminary plan. Such improvement plans shall show the proposed locations, sizes, types, grades and general design features of each facility or improvement, and shall be based on reliable field data. Improvement plan approvals are good for 24 months. If the subdivision is sold prior to completion and final platting, a mandatory review by the county engineer and road superintendent is required. Failure to comply may result in revocation of construction permit after notice and hearing before the planning commission. The developer shall receive a minimum of ten days' written notice of the hearing. The improvement construction drawing shall be submitted on white background prints. The sheet size shall be 24 inches by 36 inches unless another size is approved by the county engineer. The drawing shall include the following information: 
                  (1)  Construction plans. The developer shall provide the plan and profile of each proposed street (indicating the existing ground surface elevation and proposed street grade surface elevation including extensions for a distance of 100 feet to 300 feet beyond the tract boundary) as required by the county engineer. Design shall be in accordance with good engineering practices. 
                  (2)  Street; typical sections. A typical section of each proposed street shall be submitted, showing the width of pavement and the rights-of-way. 
                  (3)  Water supply and stormwater drainage. The plan and profile of proposed utility distribution systems and storm drainage sewers or other drainageways, with grade and sizes indicated, is required. Stormwater drainage shall be consistent with applicable county or city ordinances and other applicable governmental agencies. Water and sewer systems shall be approved by the local jurisdiction providing services and all relevant state agencies. Final approval of the improvement plans shall not be made until the developer submits to the county engineer all final permits required for the construction of all improvements from other state, local jurisdictions providing utility services or federal agencies. 
                  (4)  Utility service agreement. A developer's agreement for utilities service shall be required before final development plan approval is granted. 
                  (5)  Other public improvements. A plan shall be prepared for parks, recreation or other public use areas and improvements if included in the approved preliminary plan. 
                  (6)  As-built plans. The designing surveyor or engineer shall submit to the county engineer three sets of white background prints of certified as-built plans prior to recording of the final plat. 
                  (e)  Approval of construction drawings; time duration. Upon approval of the preliminary plat and before preparation of the final construction drawings for the minimum improvements required by this chapter, the subdivider shall receive conditional approval of such engineering plans from the county engineer as follows: 
                  (1)  The design of all minimum improvements shall be under the direction of a registered professional engineer or registered land surveyor in the state, with all plans bearing his professional seal; 
                  (2)  A letter of approval shall accompany all water and sewer plans from the county health department or the appropriate municipal utility official, if applicable; 
                  (3)  If construction has not commenced within one year of the construction plan approval, such approval shall become invalid, at which time a new preliminary plan must be submitted per current regulations at the time of resubmission.

                  Sec. 58-54. - Final plat. 
                  (a)  Conformance with preliminary plat. The final plat shall conform with the preliminary plat. If desired by the subdivider, he may submit only that portion of the preliminary plat he proposes to record and develop at that time; provided, however, that such portion conforms with all requirements of this chapter. The record plat is to be prepared and sealed by a registered design professional, licensed in the state. No plat of a land subdivision shall be recorded unless the plat conforms to the county zoning ordinance and the acceptance of the required guarantee by the board of commissioners. 
                  (b)  Filing. Filing the final plat with the building and zoning official shall include the following: 
                  (1)  A letter of application shall contain: 
                  a.  The name and address of the persons developing the subdivision and his agents; 
                  b.  Zoning of the property to be subdivided; 
                  c.  Whether or not the subdivision will be developed in phases;

                  SECTION 3 - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

                  3-1 - Interpretation and Application. 
                  In interpreting and applying these regulations, the requirements contained herein are declared to be the minimum requirements necessary to carry out the purpose of these regulations. Except as hereinafter provided, these regulations shall not be deemed to interfere with, abrogate, annul, or otherwise affect in any manner whatsoever any easements, covenants, or otherwise agreements between parties. Whenever the provisions of these regulations impose greater restrictions upon the use of land or buildings, or upon the height of buildings, or require a larger percentage of a lot to be left unoccupied than the provisions of other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, or any easements, covenants or other agreements between parties, then the provisions of these regulations shall govern. 
                  3-2 - Zoning Affects All Land and Buildings. 
                  No buildings, structures, or land shall be used or occupied; and no building, structure, or part thereof shall be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, enlarged, or structurally altered unless in conformity with the regulations of this ordinance. 
                  3-3 - Every Use Must be Upon a Lot. 
                  No building or structure may be erected or use established unless upon a lot as defined by this ordinance except as provided in Section 3-21.

                  Except as herein provided (see Section 9-4), there shall be no more than one (1) principal building or structure upon any lot in any residential district. 
                  3-5 - Open Space Not to be Encroached Upon. 
                  No open space shall be encroached upon or reduced in any manner except in conformity to the yard, setback, off-street parking space requirements, and such other regulations required by this ordinance for the district in which such building is located. Shrubbery, driveways, retaining walls, fences, curbs, and planted buffer strips shall be interpreted not to be encroachments of yards. (See Section 3-24) 
                  3-6 - Required Open Space May Not be Used by Another Building. 
                  No part of any yard, other open space, or off-street parking or loading space required in connection with any building, structure, or use by this ordinance shall be considered to be part of a required yard, or other open space, or off-street parking or loading space for any other building, structure, or use except as provided in Section 7-6. 
                  3-7 - Reduction of Yards or Lot Area. 
                  Except as provided in Section 3-21, no lot existing at the time of passage of this ordinance shall be reduced, divided, or changed so as to produce a tract of land which does not comply with the minimum dimension or area requirements of this ordinance for the district in which it is located unless said reduction or division is necessary to provide land that is needed and accepted for public use. 
                  3-8 - Encroachment on Public Rights-of-Way. 
                  No building, structure, nor any mandated buffer requirements, service area, or required off-street parking and loading facility, except driveways, shall be permitted to encroach on public rights-of-way. 
                  3-9 - Location of Accessory Buildings or Uses. 
                  Accessory buildings on lots in the RR, R-1, and R-1A zoning , when located within a front or side yard, shall be located no closer to property lines than would be allowed for a principal building. Within a rear yard, an accessory building on a residential lot shall be located at least five (5) feet from all rear property lines and eight (8) feet from all other property lines, except that in the case of corner lots, accessory buildings shall be set back from the centerline of an abutting street right-of-way a distance equal to three-fourths (¾) the front yard setback established for the zoning district in which the accessory buildings are located. In the case of a through lot (see Section 3-11) accessory buildings shall conform to front yard setbacks on both streets. Accessory buildings or uses on non-residential lots shall comply with front, side, and rear yard requirements established for the zoning district in which such buildings or uses are located. 
                  3-9.1  Accessory Building on Separate Lot: An accessory building may be permitted, as a Special Exception by the County Commission, on a separate lot from the lot of the principal building provided that: (a) the lot upon which the accessory building is to be located shall be within 400 feet of the principal use; and (b) all requirements, including use restrictions, established for the zoning district in which such accessory building is to be located shall be complied with; and (c) any structure or building erected shall meet the requirements of the Georgia State Building Code and shall be approved by the building inspector.

                  3-9.2  Swimming Pools: 
                  3-9.3  Separation from Principal Use: Any accessory building of more than eight (8) feet in height shall be located at least ten (10) feet from the principal building. 
                  3-10 - Every Lot Shall Abut a Street. 
                  No building shall be erected on a lot which does not abut an open public street (or an approved private street meeting current county development standards and duly approved by the County Commission). Every lot shall abut such street for a contiguous and uniform width as dictated by the respective zoning district. For the purpose of establishing lot abutment and minimum width to an approved street, easements, flag lots, and inconsistent widths are not acceptable in lieu of minimum lot frontage and abutment standards. These design standards shall not apply to lots abutting the radius of a cul-de-sac, where lot width shall be measured at the building setback line. 
                  When an agricultural or residential lot is created that is larger than 50 acres, such lot is not required to abut a public or private road, however, the sub-divider shall at a minimum provide access to the newly created lot from a public road via an ingress/egress and utility easement running with the land at least 60 feet in width, which shall be shown on a survey prepared by a licensed surveyor. Such easement and survey shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of Superior Court of Cook County, Georgia at the time of the creation of such lot. 
                  3-11 - Lots With Multiple Frontage. 
                  In the case of a corner lot, side yard setback requirements from the centerline of the street right-of-way shall equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of that required for the front yard setback for the respective zoning district. On a corner lot where the main entrance into a residence is facing a side yard, it shall be permissible for purposes of this ordinance to interpret the residence to be fronting on the street other than that street which said entrance faces, and side and rear yard requirements may be provided accordingly. If a building is constructed on a through lot having frontage on two (2) or more roads not at an intersection, a setback from each road shall be provided equal to the front yard requirement for the district in which the lot is located. 
                  3-12 - Visibility at Intersections. 
                  On corner lots within all zoning districts, no fence, shrubbery or other obstruction to the traffic sight vision, except utility poles or light or sign standards, shall exceed a height of three (3) feet within a triangular area formed by the intersection of the right-of-way lines of two (2) streets or a street intersection with a railroad right-of-way line, and a diagonal line which intersects the right-of-way lines at two (2) points, each twenty (20) feet distance from the intersection of the right-of-way lines, or, in the case of a rounded corner, from the point of intersection of their tangents; provided, however, signs, lights, or similar objects which are totally located at least twelve (12) feet above the finished grade shall be permitted. (See following illustration illustration)

                  3-13 - Uses Prohibited. 
                  If either a use or class of use is not specifically indicated as being permitted in a district, either as a matter of right, or as a Special Exception, then such use, class of use, or structures for such uses, shall be prohibited in such district. 
                  3-14 - Reserved. 
                  3-15 - Zoning to Apply When Lot is Divided by District Boundary Line. 
                  In the event that a district boundary line on the zoning map divides a lot of record held in one (1) ownership on the date of passage of this ordinance, each part of the lot so divided shall be used in conformity with the regulations established by this ordinance for the district in which such parcel is located; except, however, that if the property owner of such a lot so desires, he may extend a use allowed on either portion of said lot fifty (50) feet beyond the district boundary line in accordance with setbacks and yard requirements of the district into which he is encroaching. 
                  3-16 - Height Limitations of Walls and Fences. 
                  Within any residential district, no wall or fence shall exceed eight (8) feet in height within or along a boundary of a rear or side yard. Within the front yard, all fences shall have a height limit of four (4) feet. 
                  3-17 - Required Buffers in RC, GB, WLI, and HI Districts.

Off-street parking associated with such uses shall be governed by this same provision. 
                  3-18 - Screening of Service Areas In Non-Residential Areas Within One Hundred Fifty (150) Feet of Public Street. 
                  Any service area, loading area, refuse, or storage area between a principal building and a public street being visible from said street and lying within one hundred fifty (150) feet of said street shall be screened from view from the public street as specified in Section 3-19. 
                  3-19 - Screening Required. 
                  Wherever screening is required by this ordinance, a durable masonry wall, or fence and hedge of sufficient opacity to provide a visual blind, designed to be compatible with the character of adjoining properties, shall be provided and maintained by the owner and his successors and assigns. Such fences and walls shall be at least six (6) feet in height, but no greater than eight (8) feet in height, measured from the ground along the common lot line of the adjoining properties. Hedges or comparable natural plantings shall be of such variety that an average height of at least six (6) feet could be expected by normal growth within no later than three (3) years from the time of planting. The owner/developer shall install the required screening prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. Occupancy will not be allowed until the screening is completed as a part of the normal developmental requirements. 
                  3-20 - Side and Rear Yards Not Required Next to Railroad. 
                  Within any non-residential district, side yards and rear yards shall not be required adjacent to railroad rights-of-way.

                  Any lot of record existing at the time of the adoption of this ordinance which has an area or a width which is less than that required by this ordinance may be used as a building site for a structure or use permitted in that zone; provided, however, that the same yard, setback, open space, and other dimensional requirements are met that would be required for a standard lot, except as stipulated in Section 3-25. 
                  3-22 - Permitted Modification of Setback Requirement. 
                  When a building is proposed on a lot and when on either or both lots which adjoin such lot at the street right-of-way line there exists a principal building which does not conform to the setback requirements of this ordinance, the required setback for such building shall be as follows: (1) where only one said adjoining lot contains a principal building with a non-conforming setback the setback shall be the computed average of (a) the normal setback requirement with (b) the non-conforming setback, or (2) where both adjoining lots contain a principal building each with a non-conforming setback, the minimum setback shall be the computed average of the two non-conforming setbacks. 
                  3-23 - Structures Permitted Above the Height Limit. 
                  The height limits of these regulations shall not apply to a church spire, belfry, cupola, dome, or ornamental tower not intended for human occupancy, monument, water tower, observation tower, transmission tower, chimney, smoke stack, conveyor, flag pole, radio or television tower, mast or aerial, parapet wall not extending more than four (4) feet above the roof line of the building, and necessary mechanical appurtenances.

                  3-25 - Modification of Side yard Requirements. 
                  When a lot of record has a width less than the frontage required in the district in which it is located, then the Zoning Administrator shall be authorized to reduce the side yard requirements for such lot; provided, however, that there shall not be less than an eight (8) foot side yard. 
                  3-26 - Variances to Height Requirements.

                  10-4 - Groundwater Recharge Area District. 
                  10-4.1  Findings of Fact. Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides, herbicides sprayed on crops, animal waste and septic tank effluents contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies. 
                  10-4.2  Purpose. The purpose of this district is to establish criteria to protect significant groundwater recharge areas from pollution by spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, application of chemicals, injections and other development pressures. Whenever a requirement of this Section is different from a requirement of the remainder of the Cook County Zoning Ordinance, the more restrictive requirement shall control. 
                  10-4.3  District Delineation.

                  10-5 - Little River Corridor Protection District. 
                  10-5.1  Description of District. The limits of the Little River Corridor Protection District are hereby defined to be all land inclusive of islands, in areas of the Little River and being within 100 feet horizontally on both sides of the river as measured from the river banks. This area shall remain in an undisturbed vegetative buffer. The 100-foot buffer is measured from the uppermost part of the river bank, usually marked by a break in slope. Although not within the buffer area, the area between the top of the river bank and the water's edge shall be included in the district. 
                  Because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering, river bank erosion, and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time. To address this potential, local staff will require that all applicants submit a site plan, prepared on a plat or survey, upon which the applicant or his design specialist has designated the river bank. Local planning/inspections staff will verify the river bank on site, and insure its proper delineation on the site plan. The required 100 foot buffer will be clearly delineated on the site plan and enforced as a part of the local inspections process. 
                  The Little River Corridor Protection District is not intended to prescribe a specific land use but rather, to define a range of acceptable land uses. Within the range of uses which can be located within the District, this Section establishes performance standards which apply to development within the District. 
                  10-5.2  Intent. The intent of the regulations within this River Corridor Protection District is to limit the use of the Little River Corridor, in conjunction with other governmental entities along the Little River Corridor, in order to: 
                  a.  Assure that the section of the river in Cook County will not become polluted and unsuitable as a source for potable water; 
                  b.  Protect the river corridor by establishing a natural vegetative buffer area bordering the river; 
                  c.  Preserve those qualities that make the river corridor suitable as a habitat for wildlife; and 
                  d.  Help control erosion and to absorb flood waters. 
                  The further intent of this district is to protect and safeguard the health and welfare of all the citizens of Cook and adjacent counties by providing protection of the section of the river that is or may be used as a future source of drinking water. 
                  10-5.3  Conditions and Performance Standards. Within the River Corridor Protection District, the following conditions and performance standards shall apply: 
                  10-5.4  Permitted Uses.

                  10-6 - Wetlands District. 
                  10-6.1  Findings of Fact. The wetlands in Cook County, Georgia are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the State of Georgia. 
                  Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piece meal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
                  10-6.2  Purpose. The purpose of this ordinance is to promote wetlands protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. 
                  10-6.3  Establishment of the Wetlands Protection District. The Wetlands Protection District is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of Cook County, Georgia that are mapped as wetland areas by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps. This map shall be referred to as the Generalized Wetlands Map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto. 
                  The Generalized Wetlands Map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within Cook County, Georgia and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this ordinance does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
                  10-6.4  Requirement for Local Permit or Permission. No regulated activity will be permitted within the Wetlands Protection District without written permission or a permit from Cook County, Georgia. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a Wetlands Protection District boundary, as determined by the Zoning Administrator and/or his designee using the Generalized Wetlands Map, a U. S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a Section 404 Permit or Letter of Permission is issued. 
                  10-6.5  Permitted Uses. The following uses shall be allowed as of right within the Wetlands Protection District to the extent that they are no prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein. (The activities listed in this section are exempted from Section 404 regulations provided they do not have impacts on a navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of an individual 404 permit. However, under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, a permit may be required in some circumstances.) 
                  a.  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 Permit. 
                  b.  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing. 
                  c.  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission and as specified in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
                  d.  The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture. 
                  e.  The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and that approved agricultural Best Management Practices are followed. 
                  f.  Education, scientific research, and nature trails. 
                  10-6.6  Prohibited Uses. The following uses are not permitted within the Wetlands Protection District: 
                  a.  Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants; 
                  b.  Hazardous or sanitary waste landfills. 
                  SECTION 11 - SIGN REGULATIONS 

                  11-1 - Purposes. 
                  It is the purpose of Cook County in enacting these regulations to provide standards to safeguard life, public health, property and welfare by regulating the location, size, illumination, erection, maintenance and quality of materials of all signs. More specifically, signs have a powerful impact on the aesthetic environment of the community, and it is the purpose of this Ordinance to encourage an aesthetically attractive environment, allowing sufficient opportunities for communications to serve business, interest groups and the public, while complying with the Federal and State Constitutions and laws. Signs create visual clutter and therefore should be regulated in their size, location, construction and illumination. Signs can detract from the beauty of the neighborhood and lower property values. In seeking to comply with federal and state law, the County has determined the following: large signs are, as the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized, an aesthetic harm; the Georgia Supreme Court has upheld sign regulations on the basis of aesthetics and preserving the beauty of environment; and, the Eleventh Circuit has recognized portable signs are visual clutter and a potential traffic hazard. These holdings show that the County's ordinance is within the law and constitutional, which is a goal of the County. The goal of this Article is to avoid being an impermissible content-based regulation, and instead to be a permissible time, place and manner restriction. 
                  Many signs can also be a hazard and negatively impact traffic safety, by distracting drivers and blocking views of other vehicles and dangers, by making intersections more treacherous, and by making it difficult to see oncoming traffic when entering a roadway. Therefore, it is also the purpose of this Ordinance to prevent those harms by regulating signs to safe locations, safe sizes, with proper and safe illumination and construction. 
                  11-2 - Jurisdiction And Applicability Of Code Requirements. 
                  11.2.1  This article shall apply to all properties within the unincorporated areas of Cook County, Georgia. This article shall not relate to the copy or message on a sign within the unincorporated areas of Cook County. 
                  11.2.2  All signs and sign structures shall be constructed and maintained in conformance with the building and electrical codes adopted by Cook County. 
                  11.2.3  If any provisions or requirements of this article are in conflict with any other provision or requirement of this ordinance or any other applicable governmental law, ordinance, resolution, rule, or other governmental regulation of any kind, the more restrictive rule or standard takes precedence. 
                  11-3 - Variances. 
                  11-3.1  Variances from the provisions of this article may be requested. All such variances shall be considered and decided by the Cook County Board of Commissioners in accordance with officially adopted procedures and standards contained in the Cook County Zoning Ordinance, provided that the decision to grant or deny a variance shall be based upon conditions and factors pertaining to the time, place, and manner of the exhibition and construction of a sign, and not the content of the sign's copy. 
                  11-4 - General Provisions And Definitions. 
                  11-4.1  No sign shall be placed or maintained within the unincorporated area of Cook County except in conformity with this Sign Ordinance. 
                  11-4.2  Notwithstanding any other restrictions in this Sign Ordinance, any sign, display or device allowed under this Ordinance may contain any commercial or non-commercial message, or any political or non-political message; except that such messages cannot depict obscenity, as defined by O.C.G.A. § 16-12-80, nor can they depict sexual conduct or sexually explicit nudity, as defined in O.C.G.A. § 36-60-3. 
                  11-4.3  Height limitations in this Article control over the general height limitations of this Ordinance, and apply to any structure that contains a sign. For example, a church spire or radio antenna with a sign would be subject to the height limitations of this Article, rather than general height limitations. 
                  11.4.4  Definitions: As used in this section, the following words have the following meanings.

A sign height of up to 75 feet is allowed for signs up to 200 sq. ft. per direction, per face. No sign may be erected within 1000 feet of any other ground sign on the same side of the road, whether such sign is on the same lot or another lot. 
                  b)  Distances between signs are measured from the closest points of the signs at issue, whether that is the sign base or a portion of the sign structure. 
                  c)  It is the intent of this section to allow more signage along certain higher traffic corridors, while at the same time protecting the appearance of Cook County and serving the purposes enumerated in greater detail in Section 11.1. Whenever the distance requirements of this section would, if applied strictly, result in denying a person all opportunity for additional signage allowed under this section, because of the existence of a sign or signs on the property of another person or entity, a variance may be issued, subject to the procedure provided in the Zoning Ordinance, that both serves the interests of the County in adopting this sign ordinance, and also affords to such person reasonable additional signage. However, no variance shall be granted where the hardship is the result of the property owner or his predecessor-in-title's subdivision of the property. 
                  11-5.4  Highway Signs. In addition to the signs permitted elsewhere in this Ordinance, in the WLI and H-I Zoning Districts, the following additional permitted signs are allowed: 
                  a)  One additional ground sign of not more than 300 square feet per face, and not more than 35 feet in height, and not more than two-faced, may be erected on any lot that has road frontage on any U.S. Highway (e.g. 41), or any Georgia Highway (e.g. 7, 37, 76) Such sign must be erected within 50 feet of the right-of-way of said highway. No sign of more than 250 square feet erected under this section may be erected within 2,000 feet of any other ground sign exceeding 250 square feet, whether such sign is on the same lot or another lot. No sign of less than 250 square feet erected under this section may be erected within 500 feet of any other ground sign exceeding 100 square feet, whether such sign is on the same lot or another lot. 
                  b)  Distances between signs are measured from the closest points of the signs at issue, whether that is the sign base or a portion of the sign structure. 
                  c)  No sign erected under this section may be "double stacked"; that is, have two separate signs one higher than the other, both facing the same direction. Double stacked signs are permitted under other provisions of this Article. 
                  d)  It is the intent of this section to allow more signage along certain higher traffic corridors, while at the same time protecting the appearance of Cook County and serving the purposes enumerated in greater detail in Section 11.1. Whenever the distance requirements of this section would, if applied strictly, result in denying a person all opportunity for additional signage allowed under this section, because of the existence of a sign or signs on the property of another person or entity, a variance may be issued, subject to the procedure provided in the Zoning Ordinance, that both serves the interests of the County in adopting this sign ordinance, and also affords to such person reasonable additional signage. However, no variance shall be granted where the hardship is the result of the property owner or his predecessor-in-title's subdivision of the property. 
                  11-5.5  Minor Signs. Any number of minor signs is permitted in addition to all other signs permitted under this ordinance. In residential and agriculturally zoned areas, these signs must be no more than one (1) sq. ft. in area, and no more than four feet in height. In GB, WLI, and HI zoned areas, these signs must be no more than four (4) sq. ft. in area, and no more than four feet in height. However, the area of all such sign faces on a single lot, parcel, residence, development, business or property may not exceed 10 square feet in residential and agriculturally zoned areas; and 20 square feet in general business, wholesale light industrial, or heavy industrial zoned areas. 
                  11-5.6  Internal Signs. Any sign not visible from the outside of a structure or to passing members of the public is not restricted or regulated by this Article. 
                  11-5.7  Outdoor Facility Signs. Any sign that is located at an outdoor event facility that is open to the general public; such as a ball field, race track, or amphitheater, and is mounted on the internal-facing walls of the facility is excluded from the maximum number and square footage restriction. These signs must however still conform to the maximum height or other restrictions applicable to the property under this article, even if such sign is visible from public right-of-ways outside of the facility, so long as the sign faces inward toward the facility and any external visibility is incidental to the sign's location. 
                  11-6 - Regulations For Signs. 
                  11-6.1  Location, Height, and Setback. 
                  a)  The property owner must give permission for all sign placement on the owner's property, through the issuance of a letter signed by the owner. 
                  b)  All signs must comply with all side and rear setbacks of the underlying zoning ordinance. 
                  c)  Signs can be located in front setback areas, but all signs and sign structures, except as noted below, must be setback at least ten feet from the public right-of-way. No portion of a sign or sign structure shall encroach on or overhang the public right-of-way or any other person's property. Furthermore, for safety reasons, no sign shall be located closer than 10 feet from the back of the curb of a public roadway, or if there is no curb, from the edge of the pavement. 
                  d)  No sign can be erected closer than 10 feet to the right-of-way of Interstate Highway 75. 
                  e)  Distances are measured from the closest portion of the sign (whether that is the base, sign face, or the sign structure) to the right-of-way, curb or pavement. 
                  f)  The height requirements of a sign shall be computed as the length of a straight vertical line from normal grade to the height of the highest attached component of the sign or sign structure. When the sign is constructed within 15 feet of a right-of-way, the normal grade shall be considered the elevation of the crown of the road. When a sign is constructed 15 or more feet from any right-of-way, normal grade shall be considered the lower of (1) existing grade of the site of the sign prior to construction of the sign or (2) the newly established grade at the base of the sign after construction, exclusive of any filling, beaming, mounding or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. Refer to the Table of Standard Permitted Signs for specific height limits and requirements. 
                  11-6.2  Number. For the purpose of determining the number of signs, ground signs shall be equal to the number of sign structures. All other non-ground signs shall be considered to be a single display surface or display device containing elements organized, related and composed to form a unit. 
                  11-6.3  Illumination. 
                  (A)  Ground signs cannot be internally illuminated in any residential or agricultural zoning district. All signs may be externally illuminated. External illumination of any sign in any district shall be positioned and shielded so that the light source does not shine directly into the path of motorists on a public right-of-way or into the windows of adjacent dwellings or businesses without the permission of the owner and resident thereof. Signs located in residential districts shall not be illuminated between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. 
                  (B)  Flashing, blinking or otherwise varying illumination is not permitted. No external or internal illumination that causes confusion with or distraction from any traffic signal or safety device shall be permitted. 
                  (C)  All externally illuminated signs shall utilize low wattage luminaries, mounted in fixtures designed to direct the light and eliminate light trespass, such as light shining into residences or other neighboring structures. 
                  (D)  All internally illuminated signs shall utilize low wattage luminaries designed to reduce light glow. 
                  (E)  All illuminated signs over ten feet in height shall either be internally illuminated or illuminated by external lighting fixtures not visible to passing motorists. 
                  11-6.5  Calculation of Area. The area of a sign is calculated by determining the area of the smallest square or rectangle which encloses the sign face and the structure surrounding the sign face. For example, the pole or base would not be included, but any frame holding the sign face in place would be counted. See examples: 

                  Examples of Sign Face Area Measurements
                  11-6.6  Unusual Shaped Signs.Unusual shaped sign are signs that are any shape other than a square or rectangle, and include signs with projecting elements or features, round, oval, and triangular signs, signs with more than four sides, signs in the shape of an animal, object, or device, and so forth. For all such signs, the area is calculated by calculating the area of the smallest rectangle that will completely enclose all elements of the sign face and sign structure supporting the face, not including the base, OR ANY OPEN SPACE. 
                  11-6.7  Sign Support Structures. Signs 300 sq. ft. per face or larger must be constructed with a monopole-type support system. 
                  11-7 - Safety And Construction Standards., 
                  11-7.1  Engineering Approval. All signs in excess of 15 feet in height should be constructed according to plans approved by a Georgia registered professional engineer. The sign owner shall produce such approved plans at the request of Cook County Building Official. 
                  11-7.2  Official Confusion. Signs which contain or are in imitation of an official traffic sign or signal are prohibited. 
                  11-7.3  Fire Safety. No sign or sign structure may be erected or maintained which obstructs any fire escape, ventilation, or door; nor shall any sign or sign structure be attached to a fire escape. 
                  11-7.4  Corner Visibility. No sign or sign structure above a height of three feet shall be maintained within 15 feet of the intersection of the right-of-way lines of two streets, or of a street intersection with a railroad right-of-way. 
                  11-7.5  Traffic Visibility. No sign shall obstruct the view of vehicles entering the roadway (i.e., the view of oncoming traffic by vehicles attempting to enter the road). 
                  11-7.6  Good Repair. All signs, together with all their supports, braces, guys, and anchors shall be kept in good repair. Any structure formally used as a sign, but not in use for any other purpose, must be removed by the owner of the property within ten (10) days after written notification from a designated official of Cook County or thirty (30) days after its use as a valid sign has ceased, after which time, the County may cause the removal of the sign at the owner's expense. (See Cook County Nuisance Ordinance § 3-6-7 Abatement by County - § 3-6-10 Payment of Costs.) 
                  11-7.7  Removal of Unsafe Signs and Safety Hazards. The County may remove a sign in violation of this Ordinance, without giving notice to any party, if said sign is upon the public right-of-way or upon other public property; or said sign poses an immediate safety threat to the life or health of any members of the public.

                  11-9.1  Sign Registration and Building Permits. 
                  a)  Except as specifically exempted from the provisions of this article, a person or firm may not legally maintain, post, display, enlarge, erect, move, or substantially change a sign that is larger than four (4) square feet, without first obtaining a permit from the Zoning Administrator or his/ her designee. Signs using electrical wiring and connections (i.e. illuminated signs), as well as larger signs, may require additional permits under the Cook County Building Code or Zoning Ordinance, and the Cook County Building Official should be contacted regarding such signs. 
                  b)  All parties are advised to consult with the Zoning Administrator to avoid erecting signs that violate this ordinance. No person shall obtain a vested right to maintain a sign that does not comply with this ordinance at the time it is erected. Signs erected in violation of this ordinance shall be removed or reconstructed in compliance with this ordinance. 
                  c)  Permit applications for conforming signs shall be filed by the sign owner or his/ her agent with the zoning administrator or his/ her designee upon forms furnished by the County. Flags flown in a manner consistent with the Table of Standard Permitted Signs are excluded from the permit requirement. 
                  1.  Applications shall contain the following: 
                  (i)  The type of the sign as defined in this ordinance. 
                  (ii)  The value of the sign. 
                  (iii)  The street address and zoning designation of the property where the sign is to be located. 
                  (iv)  A site plan drawn to scale, that shows the location of the sign on the lot, including indicating setbacks from property lines and rights-of-way. 
                  (v)  The square foot area per sign and the aggregate square foot area if there is more than one sign face. 
                  (vi)  The name(s) and address(s) of the owner(s) of the real property upon which the sign is to be located, along with written consent of said owner(s). 
                  (vii)  Engineered construction plans for signs exceeding 15 feet in height, showing they are approved by a registered Georgia professional engineer. 
                  (viii)  Name, address, phone number and business license number of the sign contractor. 
                  2.  Fees. No permit shall be issued until the appropriate application, has been filed with the zoning administrator or his/ her designee and permit fees have been paid as adopted by the Board of Commissioners and as amended from time to time. 
                  3.  The zoning administrator or his/ her designee shall grant a permit upon receipt of a completed application if the proposed sign meets the requirements of this article. 
                  4.  Permit expiration. A permit shall become null and avoid if construction of the sign has not begun within six (6) months from the date of issuance. Issuance of a permit shall in no way prevent the county from later declaring the sign to be nonconforming or unlawful if, with further review of available information, the sign is found not to comply with the requirements of the ordinance applicable at the time that the complete permit application was filed. 
                  5.  A violation of any provisions of this article will be grounds for termination a permit granted by the county for the erection of a sign. Should it be determined that a permit was issued pursuant to an incomplete application or an application containing a false material statement, or that a permit has been erroneously issued in violation of this article, the zoning administrator or his/ her designee shall revoke the permit.

                  11-10 - Non-Conforming Signs. 
                  Signs existing legally at the time of the adoption or amendment of this ordinance, but which do not conform to newly adopted or amended provisions of this ordinance solely because of a change in the ordinance, and not because of a change to the sign, may remain as legal non-conforming signs, subject to the following provisions: 
                  a)  There must be existing property rights in the sign; 
                  b)  The right to continue a non-conforming sign is confined to the sign owner or his transferee; 
                  c)  A non-conforming sign may be restored to its original condition provided that not more than 50% of the sign is destroyed.

                  d)  A non-conforming sign when relocated or moved shall no longer be considered a non-conforming sign and thereafter shall be subject to all the provisions of law and of these Rules relating to outdoor advertising; 
                  e)  The sign must remain substantially the same as it was on the effective date of the adoption of this ordinance which rendered the sign non-conforming. Extension, enlargement, replacement, rebuilding, adding lights to a non-illuminated sign or re-erection of the sign will be considered a change in the existing use. The maintenance will be limited to:

                  5)  a change of the message, including changing faces, as long as similar materials are used and the sign face is not enlarged. 
                  f)  At no time may changes be made in a non-conforming sign which would increase the value of the sign; 
                  g)  A non-conforming sign may continue as long as it is not abandoned, destroyed, discontinued, or purchased by any governmental agency. Any sign suffering damage in excess of normal wear cannot be repaired without: 
                  1)  notifying the zoning administrator in writing of the extent of the damage, the reason the damage is in excess of normal wear, and providing a description of the repair work to be undertaken, including the value of the sign materials and the cost of the repair; and,

                  SECTION 12 - ADMINISTRATION, ENFORCEMENT, AND PENALTIES 

                  12-1 - Zoning Administrator. 
                  An administrative official designated as the Zoning Administrator by the Board of Commissioners, Cook County, Georgia, shall administer and enforce the provisions of this ordinance. 
                  12-2 - Building/Development Permit Required. 
                  A building/development permit, issued by the Zoning Administrator, is required in advance of the initiation of construction, erection, moving, demolition, or alteration of any building or structure or sign. No building or sign permit shall be issued except in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance; however, a building permit issued before the adoption of this ordinance shall remain valid with the same qualifications as issued under this ordinance. 
                  A building permit is required before the installation of a manufactured home in the unincorporated portion of Cook County. Pre-owned manufactured homes relocated into or within Cook County shall comply with the provisions of section 9-10 et seq. Of this ordinance. 
                  12-3 - Application for Building/Development Permit. 
                  All applications for building/development permits, shall be accompanied by two (2) site plans drawn to scale showing the actual dimensions of the lot to be built upon, the size and location of the lot, the number of dwelling units the building is designed to accommodate, the setback lines of the building on the "permit lot", the various easements on the lot and such other information as may be essential for determining whether the provisions of this ordinance are being observed. Applications shall also include construction documents (building plans) along with any other documentation required by the Building/ Zoning Administrator. The following is required on the site plan before the site plan is considered by the Zoning Administrator and any permits are approved (single family residential, duplexes and agricultural buildings, and their accessory uses are excluded from the following items except number 3 below): 
                  1.  Topography (MSL) existing and proposed. 
                  2.  Drainage plans. 
                  3.  Location and size of ingress/egress. 
                  4.  Water mains and services, both existing and proposed. 
                  5.  Water services as well as fire hydrants in the lot and the specific meter size and location. 
                  Any building/development permit shall become void if the work involved has not begun within six (6) months after the date of issuance of the permit or if the work or development authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of six (6) months after the work or development is commenced; provided that extensions of time and periods not exceeding six (6) months each may be allowed in writing by the Zoning Administrator. Any unapproved deviation from the site plan shall cause the Zoning Administrator to not issue a Certificate of Occupancy. 
                  Toilet facilities shall be provided for construction workers, and such facilities shall be maintained in a sanitary condition, that conforms to ANSI Z43. 
                  The applicant for a building permit shall submit a certificate with his application which certifies that the lot which he proposes to develop is a lot of record. When the lot in question does not meet the lot width and lot area requirements of this ordinance, then the applicant shall certify that such lot was a lot of record prior to the adoption of this ordinance or is a lot which has been created through governmental taking of property. In such case, the applicant shall file a copy of the recorded deed showing the date that the property was transferred and the deed recorded, or, in the case of condemnation, the easement or order of taking and survey showing the date and scope of the taking. 
                  All applications for a building/development permit shall be closely coordinated with Cook County's Soil and Sedimentation and Erosion Control Ordinance. 
                  12-3.1  Coordination with Development of Regional Impact Requirements. The Georgia Department of Community Affairs, pursuant to the Georgia Planning Act, has established criteria for the identification of certain large scale developments which have the potential to cause land use impacts beyond the boundaries of the respective local government where a project might be proposed. These developments, known as Developments of Regional Impact (DRIs), shall be submitted, based on established DCA standards, procedures, and format, to the South Georgia Regional Development Center (SGRDC) for review and recommendation prior to issuance of any local building or development permit or utility tap (does not apply to any activity reviewed under any earlier rezoning proposal). As such, these requirements establish an official delay in the local permitting process to allow for compliance with these requirements. 
                  12-3.2  Coordination with Water Resource District Requirements. As identified in Section 10, Water Resource Districts, Cook County contains three identified water resources: Groundwater Recharge Areas, River Corridor Protection Areas, and Potential Wetlands Areas. The Groundwater Recharge Areas and Protected River Corridor segments are available as digital overlays, and the potential generalized wetlands areas are available as manual overlays. Prior to issuance of any local building/development permits, these data bases shall be checked, and if any are found applicable to the subject project or property, all requirements of Section 10, Water Resource District, shall be enforced as part of the permitting process. 
                  12-3.3  Coordination with Flood Plain Management Requirements. Areas of potential flood hazards, as identified by the current Federal Emergency Management Agency Flood Hazard Study for Cook County are available as a digital overlay to Cook County's parcel data. The Cook County Zoning Administrator shall review all applications for building/development permits which proposes to develop properties which have been duly identified as having a flood hazard potential. These building/development permit applications shall be closely coordinated with Health Department staff and the County Engineer to insure compliance with all standards contained in the County's Flood Hazard Mitigation Ordinance. All submitted technical data, as well as any elevation certificates or flood proofing certificates shall be maintained as part of the building/development application and inspections files. 
                  12-4 - Penalties for Violation. 
                  In case any building or structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed, demolished, altered, repaired, moved, converted or maintained, or land is used in violation of this ordinance, the offender shall, upon conviction in Magistrate's Court, be punished in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 15-10-60, as it may be amended from time to time, for each offense. Each day of continued violation shall be considered a separate offense. 
                  12-5 - Enforcement. 
                  The Magistrate's Court of Cook County shall have jurisdiction over violators of this ordinance and all procedures for enforcement of such ordinance shall be as provided in Article 4, Chapter 10 of Title 15, Official Code of Georgia. Complaints of violations of any provision of this ordinance shall be brought before the Magistrate's Court by the Zoning Administrator or his designated representative and shall be prosecuted through that court. 
                  12-6 - Remedies. 
                  In case any building or structure is or is proposed to be erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, converted, or maintained, or any building, structure, or land is or is proposed to be used in violation of these regulations, the Zoning Administrator, County Attorney, or other appropriate county authority or any adjacent or neighboring property owner or occupant who would be damaged by such violation may, in addition to other remedies, institute injunction, mandamus, or other appropriate action or proceedings to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion, maintenance, or use; or to correct or abate such violation, or to prevent the occupancy of said building, structure, or land. 
                  12-7 - Complaints Regarding Violations. 
                  When a violation of this resolution occurs, or is alleged to have occurred, any person may file a written complaint.

                  13-1.2  Legal Proceedings Stayed: An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the Board after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board or by a court of record on application, on notice to the Zoning Administrator, and on due cause shown. 
                  13-1.3  Presentation of Evidence: The appellant, and any public agency or private individual shall be entitled to present evidence on matters before the Board, and said Board may request technical service, advice, data, or factual evidence from the Planning Advisory Commission and the governing authority for assistance in reaching decisions.

                  13-3.2  Request for a Variance: The Board may authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of these regulations as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of provisions of these regulations will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of these regulations shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Provided, however, that a variance shall not be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by this ordinance in the district in question. Such variance may be granted in an individual case upon finding by the board that all of the following exists: 
                  a.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography; and 
                  b.  The application of these regulations to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship; and

Provided, that whenever the Board of Appeals shall find, in the case of any permit granted pursuant to the provisions of these regulations that any of the terms, conditions or restrictions upon which such permit was granted are not being complied with, said Board shall rescind and revoke such permit after giving due notice to all parties concerned and granting full opportunity for public hearing. 
                  13-3.3  Request for Extension of Non-Conforming Residential Uses: The Board may authorize upon appeal in specific cases an extension or replacement of an existing non-conforming residential use which the Board is specifically authorized to pass on under the terms of this ordinance. Said extension may be granted in an individual case upon finding by the Board that: 
                  a.  The use is a non-conforming use as defined in these regulations; and 
                  b.  The use is in full compliance with all requirements of these regulations applicable to non-conforming uses; and 
                  c.  The extension of said use will not further injure a permitted use on adjacent property in the same district. 
                  d.  This section is specifically designed to allow for the replacement of homeowner occupied residential units in areas no longer zoned for residential uses. As such, this provision is not subject to the limits of Section 8-5.

All information required on said forms shall be provided by the applicant. Forms shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator, and the applicant shall pay Cook County for expenses incidental to the appeal.

                  SECTION 14 - AMENDMENT 

                  14-1 - General Conditions. 
                  These regulations, including the official zoning maps, may be amended by the Board of Commissioners on their own motion, on petition of a property owner or his duly authorized agent, or on recommendation of the Planning Advisory Commission, but no amendment shall become effective unless it shall have been proposed by or shall first have been submitted to the Planning Advisory Commission for review and recommendation. Before enacting an amendment to these regulations, the governing authority shall give public notice and hold a public hearing thereon as set forth in this section. 
                  14-1.1  Establishment of Comprehensive Plan. The 2015 Greater Cook Comprehensive Plan, as duly amended, is established as official policy of Cook County. As such, the goals and policies of the Plan, and the resultant Future Land Use Plan, shall serve as the guide under which the unincorporated areas of the county are divided into zoning districts. The recommendations of the Plan are hereby established as official policy of the county, and shall receive due consideration in all requests as reflected in Section 14-2.9(e) Standards for Exercise of Zoning Power. 
                  14-1.2  Limited Use Provision. The Cook County Board of Commissioners establish the "Limited Use" provision for the purpose of allowing an applicant to request that a certain area be designated as a limited use. In some areas of the county, a specific land use activity out of a general zoning classification may have less community impact than some of the possibilities of use in that specific zoning district. For this reason, an applicant may request in his rezoning petition to limit the use of a proposed property to a specified use only (for example, R-C LU - Rural Commercial District limited to a bait and tackle store), the Planning Commission may recommend a Limited Use rezoning, or the County Commission may grant a Limited Use rezoning. The requested limited use must be among the uses permitted in the zoning district classification for which the limited use is requested. Alteration or change of an approved limited use shall be treated as any normal zoning amendment. 
                  14-1.3  Special Conditions Limitations. An applicant may file site plans, renderings, construction specifications, written development restrictions and other site planning or development conditions which the applicant proposes, the Planning Commission recommends, or the County Commission grants as binding conditions upon the development and use of the property involved in the application. Should the application be approved with these conditions, any alteration or change of a special conditions limitation shall be treated as any normal zoning amendment. 
                  14-1.4  Rezoning for classification other than that requested. When considering a rezoning application, the Board of Commissioners may rezone the subject property to a classification other than that requested by the applicant, either upon the recommendation of the Planning Advisory Commissioner, or upon its own motion, with or without the consent of the property owner, whenever it finds that the property should be rezoned, but that the classification sought by the applicant would not serve the best interests of the County, in light of the standards for exercise of zoning powers. 
                  14-2 - Application for Amendment. 
                  14-2.1  General: Applications for amendment of these regulations may be in the form of proposals for amendment of the text of these regulations, proposals for amendment of the zoning maps or requests for Special Exception approval. Applications for amendment shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator and shall include a fee payable to the county to defray expenses as set from time to time by the County Commission. No application for a zoning change affecting the same parcel of property or part thereof shall be accepted by the Zoning Administrator until the expiration of at least 90 days immediately following the defeat of the rezoning request by the Cook County Commission. 
                  14-2.2  Signature of Applicant Required: All applications shall be signed by the applicant, and shall state his name and address.

These developments, known as Developments of Regional Impact (DRIs), shall be submitted, based on established DCA standards, procedures, and format, to the South Georgia Regional Development Center (SGRDC) for review and recommendation prior to any Planning Advisory Commission or Cook County Commission action. As such, these requirements establish an official delay in the local amendment process to allow for compliance with these requirements.;ol0; 
                  14-2.8  Referral to Planning Advisory Commission: Within five (5) days after the routine monthly application acceptance deadline, the Zoning Administrator shall transmit a copy of the completed application to applicable local staff members for review and recommendation. The Zoning Administrator shall coordinate this local review process with the County's planning staff and/or planning consultant to prepare a written staff report on all matters brought before the Planning Advisory Commission and County Commission. The Planning Advisory Commission shall review each application for consistency with the adopted local Comprehensive Plan, and the adopted standards for exercise of the zoning powers. The staff report and Planning Advisory Commission recommendations shall be made at a public hearing and then be transmitted to the County Commissioners. The Planning Advisory Commission shall have thirty (30) days within which to submit a report to the County Commissioners.

                  The Zoning Administrator and/or designee shall then announce the matter for consideration. The Chairman shall then call for acknowledgment of a potential conflict of interest by members of the Commission. (See Subsection 14-2.9h) The Zoning Administrator will then report the staff recommendation and the recommendation of the Greater Cook Planning Advisory Commission. The Chairman shall then allow public input. General procedures to be followed will require citizen comments to be heard in an orderly fashion. Citizens speaking in favor of the request shall be heard first, followed by those opposed to the issue. All speakers will be asked to provide his or her name and address for the public record. Citizens are requested to keep their comments as brief as possible so that all who wish to be heard will have adequate time. Where there is a large number of citizens wishing to testify at a given hearing, the presiding officer may invoke reasonable time limitations on both the proponents and opponents of a request. In such cases, these time limits shall apply to both sides of an issue equally, such minimum time period to be no less than ten minutes per side. Citizens shall address their comments to the County Commission as a whole. Individual attacks or cross examination of Commission members, county employees or other citizens will be ruled out of order. The Commission retains the privilege to ask any questions of staff or any citizen present for clarification. The Commission also retains the right to reopen the public hearing if a Commissioner has a question for the applicant or other speaker. 
                  After all citizen comments have been received, all further discussion of the specific application is reserved for the County Commission. The Chairman shall then declare the public hearing closed and no further public comment will be entertained. The County Commission will then render a decision on the application. So that the purpose of this Ordinance will be served, health, public safety, and general welfare secured, the County Commission may approve the application, reduce the land area for which the application is made, change the district requested, add or delete conditions of the application, deny an application, or defer consideration of an application to acquire additional information. An action by the Commission to defer the application shall include a statement of the date and time of the next meeting at which the application will be considered, which statement shall constitute public notice of the hearing on the application and no further notice, is required. IN THE CASE OF TABLING OF A MATTER, NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT WILL BE ENTERTAINED UPON FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF THE MATTER. 
                  When, in the opinion of the County Commission, the official public hearing has brought forth substantial new evidence or testimony not available to the Greater Cook Planning Advisory Commission at the time of their review of a zoning matter, or should the Commission desire to request further study by the Planning Advisory Commission of a particular aspect of an application, it shall be the policy of the Commission to table the issue and request that the Planning Advisory Commission restudy the issue and affirm or amend its recommendation, which action shall be reported to the County Commission prior to making a final decision. 
                  e.  Standards for Exercise of Zoning Powers: In order to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of Cook County against the unrestricted use of property, the following standards, and other factors relevant to balancing the above stated public interests shall be considered as they apply to any application brought before the Planning Advisory Commission or the County Commission for a zoning decision: 
                  1.  Is the proposed zoning or use suitable in view of the zoning and development of adjacent and nearby property? 
                  2.  Does the request represent the possible creation of an isolated district unrelated to adjacent and nearby districts and will the proposed use adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property? 
                  3.  Will the proposed use cause an excessive or burdensome use of public facilities or services, including but not limited to streets, schools, water, sewer, or other public utilities, including police and fire protection? 
                  4.  Is the proposed use supported by new or changing conditions not anticipated by the Comprehensive Plan or is the proposed use compatible and consistent with the purpose and intent of the Comprehensive Plan? 
                  5.  Will the proposed change adversely influence existing conditions in the neighborhood or the city or county at large and are there substantial reasons why the property cannot or should not be used as currently zoned? 
                  6.  Are there potential adverse impacts on the environment, including but not limited to drainage, soil erosion and sedimentation, flooding, air quality, and water quality and quantity? 
                  7.  Are the costs required of the public in providing, improving, increasing or maintaining public utilities, schools, streets and public safety necessities reasonable when considering the proposed changes? 
                  8.  Will the proposed change be detrimental to the value or improvement of development of adjacent or nearby property in accordance with existing requirements and development standards? 
                  9.  Is the proposed change out of scale with the needs of the neighborhood or Cook County or does the request reflect a reasonable balance between the promotion of the public health, safety, morality, or general welfare and the right to unrestricted use of property? 
                  10.  Will the proposed change constitute a grant of special privilege to the individual owner as contrasted with the adjacent or nearby neighborhood or with the general public?

                  h.  Are public facilities such as schools, water, sewer or other public utilities and police and fire protection adequate to serve the proposed Special Exception use? 
                  i.  Are refuse, service parking and loading areas on the property located or screened to protect other properties in the area from such adverse effects as noise, light glare and other negative impacts?

                  k.  Will the height, size or location of the buildings or other structures on the property be compatible with the height, size or location of buildings or other structures on neighboring properties? 
                  l.  Provided, that the County Commission may impose or require such additional restrictions and standards as may be necessary to protect the health and safety of workers and residents in the community, and to protect the value and use of property in the general neighborhood.

                  2.  Has a ten percent (10%) or more direct ownership interest in the total assets or capital stock in any business entity which has any direct ownership in any real property affected by a rezoning action under consideration by Cook County Government; or

Such an official, which shall include members of the County Commission, or Planning Advisory Commission also shall disqualify himself/herself from voting on the rezoning action and shall not take any other action on behalf of himself or herself or anyone else to influence action on the rezoning action. Any written disclosures made pursuant to this section which result in the inability of the County Commission to obtain a quorum for the purpose of making a final decision when considering a rezoning action, the County Commission shall initiate the special master process set forth in O.C.G.A. s36-67a-5, as amended. Moreover, questions of interpretation as to the application of this statute should be resolved by reference to the Georgia state law governing campaign contribution disclosures, O.C.G.A. s36-67-1 et seq, as amended.
