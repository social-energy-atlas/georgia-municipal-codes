         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of Liberty County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1987 Code, as updated through December 17, 2015, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Board of Commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1987 Code, as updated, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Jim C. Jenkins, Senior Code Attorney, and Janis Adams, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

                  Sec. 2-49. - Policy statement.

                  (2)  Uphold the Constitutional laws, and legal regulations of the United States and the State of Georgia and of Liberty County therein and never be a party to their evasion; 
                  (3)  Give a full day's labor for a full day's pay and give to the performance of his duties his earnest effort and best thought; 
                  (4)  Seek to find and employ more efficient and economical ways of getting tasks accomplished; 
                  (5)  Never discriminate unfairly by the dispensing of special favors or privileges to anyone, whether for remuneration or not, and never accept, for himself or his family, favors or benefits under circumstances which might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the performance of his governmental duties;

                  (b)  No public servant shall use or attempt to use his office improperly to request, grant, or obtain in any manner any unlawful privileges, advantages or financial benefits for himself or others; provided that nothing in this provision shall be construed to prohibit or discourage any public servant from performing any official duty or action zealously and enthusiastically. 
                  (c)  All public servants have a fiduciary duty to use county fiscal and human resources in a manner which advances the public interest, and to refrain from using county property and resources for their personal benefit; therefore, public servants are prohibited from using county property and resources for personal benefit or in any manner which violates any applicable law or policy or which is not otherwise authorized. Furthermore, a public servant shall not direct employees of the county or other public servants to misappropriate or use county property and resources for any purpose other than authorized by law.

                  (b)  Any contract entered into in violation of this section may be voided by the county in an action commenced within three years of the date on which the board, or the department or officer acting for the county in regard to the allocation of funds from which such payment is derived, knew or should have known that a violation of this section occurred. This section does not affect the application of any state statute.

                  Sec. 2-56. - Deliberation and vote prohibited. 
                  Except as otherwise provided by law, no public servant shall, in such capacity, participate in the discussion, debate, deliberation or vote, or otherwise take part in the decision-making process on any agenda item before the board or other body in which the public servant has a conflict of interest or other impermissible relationship as provided in this division. 
                  (Code 1987, § 2-30; Ord. of 4-1-2003, § 2-10) 
                  Sec. 2-57. - Duty to leave meeting. 
                  (a)  To avoid the appearance of impropriety, after any public servant is determined to have a conflict of interest or a potential conflict of interest in any matter, and once all questions relating to the conflict of interest have been answered to the satisfaction of the board or other relevant decision maker, the public servant shall immediately leave the meeting room, except that if the matter is being considered at a public meeting, the public servant may remain in the area of the room occupied by the general public. If a public servant who has a conflict of interest in a matter is present as a member of the board or other body which is to consider the matter, the public servant shall leave his regular seat as a member of the body, and not return to it until deliberation and action on the matter is completed. 
                  (b)  Nothing herein shall require members of voting bodies to leave their seats while action is taken regarding any item contained on a "consent agenda" on which there is no deliberation, the public servant's conflict has been disclosed, and the public servant abstains from voting on the item.

                  Sec. 2-58. - Disclosure of conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest. 
                  (a)  A public servant who has or may have, a conflict of interest in a matter which requires an official action by the board or other body, shall, before the matter is decided, disclose the conflict of interest or the potential or alleged conflict of interest. All questions relating to a conflict of interest shall be resolved before the matter is decided, and if the matter comes before the board or other body, before the board or other body engages in any consideration of the merits of the matter. 
                  (b)  The county attorney shall at all times comply with the state laws and standards governing the professional conduct of lawyers (collectively, the "bar standards"). If the county attorney has or may have a conflict of interest in any matter before the board to the extent requiring disclosure to the board under the bar standards (such as that arising from the representation of a party whose legal position is adverse to that of the board), the county attorney shall disclose the same to the board. If the county attorney and the board determine that the county attorney's office cannot resolve the conflict in a manner which will allow the county attorney's office to perform its duties properly in the matter, then the county attorney shall be disqualified from acting in such matter. Notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary, the conduct of the county attorney in such matters shall in no event be amenable to review by the ethics board, but shall instead be subject to review and discipline by the State Bar of Georgia as provided in the bar standards.

                  Sec. 2-59. - Board of ethics. 
                  (a)  There is created a board of ethics, which shall be deemed an instrumentality of the county, to review and, if necessary, hear complaints filed against any public officer subject to the provisions of this division, if such complaints involve impropriety of said public officers and violations of the provisions of this division, and if such violation affects the elected official's ability to carry out his official duties. 
                  (b)  The ethics board shall consist of three members who are residents of the county and shall serve without compensation; the membership to be reflective of the citizenry of the county. Members of the board of ethics shall not be elected officials or county employees. 
                  (c)  Ethics board members shall be appointed by the board for terms of two years, and shall hold office until their successor is appointed and duly qualified, as follows: The chairperson of the board shall appoint one member, the remaining members of the board shall appoint one member, and the full board shall together appoint one member. Ethics board members may serve consecutive terms.

The county attorney is designated to be the legal advisor for the ethics board. The county attorney shall not be eligible for appointment to the ethics board. 
                  (g)  Prior to the appointment of any member to the ethics board, public notice of the opportunity for service on the ethics board shall be made in accordance with the board's then-current practice with respect to the advertisement of board appointments generally. 
                  (h)  The board may remove any member of the ethics board for good cause. As used herein, the term "good cause" shall mean: 
                  (1)  The failure to regularly attend meetings of the ethics board in accordance with policies established from time to time by the board; 
                  (2)  Misconduct or misfeasance in office; 
                  (3)  An event of disability rendering the member incapable of fully and properly discharging his duties; or 
                  (4)  Any conduct or activity inconsistent with his service on the ethics board or which otherwise undermines its effectiveness, all as determined by the board in its sole and absolute discretion. 
                  Prior to the removal of any member of the ethics board, the board shall give the member written notice of the removal and the reasons therefor. Following receipt of such notice, the member being removed shall be afforded an opportunity to formally reply to the contents of such notice in a form and manner to be specified by the board, to include, without limitation, a public hearing regarding such matter. In any event, the decisions of the board regarding such removal shall be final and absolute.

                  Sec. 2-60. - Duties and powers of the board. 
                  (a)  The board shall, in addition to its other duties: 
                  (1)  Adopt written rules governing its procedures and providing for the holding of meetings, which rules shall be subject to the approval of the board; a copy of the rules shall be filed with the county; 
                  (2)  Conduct hearings as needed to hear and decide specific cases in which a violation of this division is alleged in a complaint brought under this division;

                  (4)  When it deems it appropriate, request the county attorney for assistance in compelling the production of documents and witnesses to assist the ethics board in the conduct of any investigation. 
                  All opinions and other public documents of the ethics board shall be filed with the county and are open to public inspection in accordance with the Georgia Open Records Act. 
                  (b)  The ethics board shall not have the power to issue advisory opinions, but its primary purpose under this division shall be to review complaints filed hereunder. It shall be the responsibility of the county attorney to render an opinion with respect to the prospective conduct of all public servants. An opinion need not be written, and may be provided directly to the requestor of such opinion. Neither a request for an opinion, nor the making of a statement concerning a potential conflict of interest made by a public servant in the course of abstaining from voting or making a motion of self-recusal, shall create a presumption or inference that a public servant actually has a personal interest in the matter about which the opinion was requested. Additionally, the ethics board shall have no power or authority to impose any penalty or sanction any public servant pursuant to this division, but such power shall be exercised exclusively by the board.

                  (e)  The following principles shall apply to evidence in connection with hearings conducted by the board: 
                  (1)  The ethics board shall not be bound to adhere to statutory rules of evidence, but shall be fundamentally fair in its administration of evidence; 
                  (2)  During any hearing conducted by the ethics board to determine whether a violation of this division has occurred, all evidence including certified copies of records which the ethics board considers shall be fully offered and made a part of the record in the proceedings;

                  (g)  The person complained against shall have 30 days from the day after the county received the complaint to submit a written response to the complaint prior to the ethics board deciding whether to hold a hearing. 
                  (h)  Within 60 days following the filing of the complaint, the ethics board shall review and consider the same, and, if a hearing is to be held, shall set a date certain for the hearing to take place within 30 days, unless the accused petitions for and the ethics board consents to a later date.

                  ARTICLE III. - PROCUREMENT POLICY 

                  Sec. 2-99. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  Generally. The county board of commissioners shall provide for a procurement system of quality and integrity; provide for the fair and equitable treatment of all persons or firms involved in purchasing by the county board of commissioners; ensure that supplies and services are procured efficiently, effectively, and at the most favorable prices available to the county board of commissioners; promote competition in contracting; and ensure that the county board of commissioner's purchasing actions are in full compliance with applicable federal standards, state, and local laws. 
                  (b)  Applicability. This procurement policy applies to all procurement actions of the county board of commissioners as applicable for the expenditure of federal funds except as noted under "exclusions." However, nothing in this policy shall prevent the county board of commissioners from complying with the terms and conditions of any grant, contract, gift or bequest that is otherwise consistent with the law. When both federal and non-federal grant funds are used for a project, the work to be accomplished with the funds should be separately identified prior to procurement so that appropriate requirements can be applied, if necessary. If it is not possible to separate the funds, federal procurement regulations shall be applied to the total project. If funds and work can be separated and work can be completed by a new contract, then regulations applicable to the source of funding may be followed. 
                  (c)  Definition. The term "procurement," as used in this policy, includes the procuring, purchasing, leasing, or renting of: 
                  (1)  Goods, supplies, equipment, and materials; 
                  (2)  Construction and maintenance; 
                  (3)  Consultant services; 
                  (4)  Architectural and engineering (AIE) services; and 
                  (5)  Other services. 
                  (d)  Changes in laws and regulations. In the event an applicable law or regulation is modified or eliminated, or a new law or regulation is adopted, the revised law or regulation shall, to the extent inconsistent with these policies, automatically supersede these policies. 
                  (e)  Public access to procurement information. Most procurement information that is not proprietary is a matter of public record and shall be available to the public to the extent provided in the Georgia Freedom of Information Act. 
                  (Code 1987, § 2-101; Ord. No. 2010-007, § 3.1.0, 7-6-2010) 
                  Sec. 2-100. - Ethics in public contracting. 
                  (a)  Generally. The county board of commissioners hereby establishes this code of conduct regarding procurement issues and actions and shall implement a system of sanctions for violations. This code of conduct, etc., is consistent with applicable federal, state, or local law. 
                  (b)  Conflicts of interest. No employee, officer, board member, or agent of the county board of commissioners shall participate directly or indirectly in the selection or award of any contract if a conflict of interest, either real or apparent, would be involved. This type of conflict would be when one of the persons listed below has a direct financial interest, or employment or other contractual relationship, in a firm competing for the award: 
                  (1)  An employee, officer, board member, or agent involved in making the award; 
                  (2)  An organization which employs or is negotiating to employ, or has an arrangement concerning prospective employment of any of the above. 
                  (Code 1987, § 2-102; Ord. No. 2010-007, § 3.2.0, 7-6-2010) 
                  Sec. 2-101. - Purchasing procedures. 
                  (a)  Micro purchase procedures. For any purchases not exceeding $5,000.00, the county board of commissioners will use the micro purchase procedure. Under micro purchase procedures, only one quote is required, provided the quote is considered reasonable. The county board of commissioners may award micro purchases without soliciting competitive quotations if the county administrator considers the price to be reasonable (e.g., based on recent research, experience, or purchases). The county board of commissioners shall make every effort to distribute micro purchases equitably among qualified vendors. 
                  (b)  Small purchase procedures. For any amounts above the micro purchase ceiling, but not exceeding $25,000.00, the county board of commissioners may use small purchase procedures. Under small purchase procedures, the county board of commissioners shall obtain a minimum of three quotes. To the greatest extent feasible, and to promote competition, small purchases should be distributed among qualified sources. Quotes may be obtained orally (either in person or by phone), by fax, in writing, or through e-procurement. Award shall be made to the qualified vendor that provides the best value to the county board of commissioners. If award is to be made for reasons other than lowest price, documentation shall be provided in the contract file. The county board of commissioners shall not break down requirements aggregating more than the small purchase threshold (or the micro purchase threshold) into several purchases that are less than the applicable threshold merely to: 
                  (1)  Permit use of the small purchase procedures; or 
                  (2)  Avoid any requirements that apply to purchases that exceed the micro purchase threshold. 
                  (c)  Sealed bids. Sealed bidding shall be used for all contracts that exceed the small purchase threshold and that are not competitive proposals or noncompetitive proposals, as these terms are defined in this document. Sealed bidding is the method for procuring construction, supply, and non-complex service contracts that are expected to exceed $25,000.00. 
                  (d)  Competitive proposals. Unlike sealed bidding, the competitive proposal method permits: consideration of technical factors other than price; discussion with firms making proposals concerning offers submitted; negotiation of contract price or estimated cost and other contract terms and conditions; revision of proposals before the final contractor selection; and the withdrawal of an offer at any time up until the point of award. Award is normally made on the basis of the proposal that represents the best overall value, considering price and other factors, e.g., technical expertise, past experience, quality of proposed staffing, etc., set forth in the solicitation and not solely the lowest price. 
                  (e)  Noncompetitive proposals. 
                  (1)  Conditions for use. Procurement by noncompetitive proposals (sole-source) may be used only when the award of a contract is not feasible using small purchase procedures, sealed bids, cooperative purchasing, or competitive proposals, and if one of the following applies: 
                  a.  The item is available only from a single source, based on a good faith review of available sources; 
                  b.  An emergency exists that seriously threatens the public health, welfare, or safety, or endangers property, or would otherwise cause serious injury to the citizens of the county, as may arise by reason of a flood, earthquake, epidemic, riot, equipment failure, or similar event. In such cases, there must be an immediate and serious need for supplies, services, or construction such that the need cannot be met through any of the other procurement methods, and the emergency procurement shall be limited to those supplies, services, or construction necessary simply to meet the emergency; 
                  c.  The federal or state grantee authorizes the use of noncompetitive proposals; or 
                  d.  After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate. 
                  (2)  Justification. Each procurement that is done based on noncompetitive proposals shall be supported by a written justification for the selection of this method. The justification shall be approved in writing by the county administrator and/or board of commissioners. Poor planning or lack of planning is not justification for emergency or sole-source procurements. The justification, to be included in the procurement file, shall be provided. 
                  (f)  Cooperative purchasing intergovernmental agreements. The county board of commissioners may enter into state and/or local cooperative or intergovernmental agreements to purchase or use common supplies, equipment, or services. The decision to use an interagency agreement instead of conducting a direct procurement shall be based on economy and efficiency. If used, the interagency agreement shall stipulate who is authorized to purchase on behalf of the participating parties and shall specify inspection, acceptance, termination, payment, and other relevant terms and conditions. The county board of commissioners may use federal or state excess and surplus property instead of purchasing new equipment and property if feasible and if it will result in a reduction of project costs. 
                  (Code 1987, § 2-103; Ord. No. 2010-007, § 3.3.0, 7-6-2010) 
                  Sec. 2-102. - Independent cost estimate (ICE). 
                  For all purchases above the micro purchase threshold, the county board of commissioners shall prepare an independent cost estimate (ICE) prior to solicitation. The details shall be commensurate with the cost and complexity of the purchase. 
                  (Code 1987, § 2-104; Ord. No. 2010-007, § 3.4.0, 7-6-2010) 
                  Sec. 2-103. - Cost and price analysis. 
                  The county board of commissioners shall require assurance that, before entering into a contract, the price is reasonable, in accordance with the following instructions: 
                  (1)  Petty cash and micro purchases. No formal cost or price analysis is required. Rather, the execution of a contract by the county administrator or designee (through a purchase order or other means) shall serve as the county administrator's determination that the price obtained is reasonable, which may be based on the county administrator's or designee's prior experience or other factors. 
                  (2)  Small purchases. A comparison with other offers shall generally be sufficient determination of the reasonableness of price and no further analysis is required. If a reasonable number of quotes is not obtained to establish reasonableness through price competition, the county administrator or designee shall document price reasonableness through other means, such as prior purchases of this nature, catalog prices, the county administrator or designee's personal knowledge at the time of purchase, comparison to the ICE, or any other reasonable basis. 
                  (3)  Sealed bids. The presence of adequate competition should generally be sufficient to establish price reasonableness. Where sufficient bids are not received, and when the bid received is substantially more than the ICE, and where the county board of commissioners cannot reasonably determine price reasonableness, the county board of commissioners must conduct a cost analysis, consistent with federal guidelines, to ensure that the price paid is reasonable, and if the bid is found not to be reasonable in the opinion of the board of commissioners, the bid can be rejected. 
                  (4)  Competitive proposals. The presence of adequate competition should generally be sufficient to establish price reasonableness. Where sufficient proposals are not received (generally three or more), the county board of commissioners must compare the selected proposer's cost estimate with the ICE. For competitive proposals where costs or prices cannot be easily compared among the firms that have submitted proposals, where there is not adequate competition, or where the proposed cost or price is substantially greater than the ICE, the county board of commissioners must conduct a cost analysis, consistent with federal guidelines, to ensure that the price paid is reasonable, and if the bid is found not to be reasonable in the opinion of the board of commissioners, the proposal can be rejected. 
                  (5)  Contract modifications. A cost analysis, consistent with federal guidelines, shall be conducted for all contract modifications for projects that were procured through sealed bids, competitive proposals, or noncompetitive proposals, or for projects originally procured through small purchase procedures and the amount of the contract modification will result in a total contract price in excess of $100,000.00. Such modifications shall require the approval of the governing board. 
                  (Code 1987, § 2-105; Ord. No. 2010-007, § 3.5.0, 7-6-2010) 
                  Sec. 2-104. - Solicitation and advertising. 
                  (a)  Method of solicitation. 
                  (1)  Petty cash and micro purchases. The county board of commissioners may contact only one source if the price is considered reasonable. 
                  (2)  Small purchases. Quotes may be solicited orally, through fax, or by any other reasonable method. 
                  (3)  Sealed bids and competitive proposals. Solicitation must be done publicly. The county board of commissioners must use one or more following solicitation methods, provided that the method employed provides for meaningful competition: 
                  a.  Advertising in newspapers or other print mediums of local or general circulations. 
                  b.  Advertising in various trade journals or publications or web sites. 
                  c.  E-procurement. The county board of commissioners may conduct its public procurements through the Internet using e-procurement systems. However, all procurements must otherwise be in compliance with 24 CFR 85.36, state and local requirements, and the county board of commissioners' procurement policy. 
                  d.  For acquisition of professional services when a "request for proposals" is used, the commission may require prequalification of consultants or contractors. The commission may base prequalification on firms meeting the state criteria. 
                  (4)  Request for qualifications. Solicitation must be done publicly. The county board of commissioners must use one or more following solicitation methods, provided that the method employed provides for meaningful competition: 
                  a.  Advertising in newspapers or other print mediums of local or general circulations. 
                  b.  Advertising in various trade journals or publications or web sites. 
                  c.  For acquisition of professional services when a "request for qualifications" is used, the commission may require prequalification of consultants or contractors. The commission may base prequalification on firms meeting the state criteria. 
                  (b)  Time frame. For purchases of more than $25,000.00, public notice should run not less than once each week for two consecutive weeks. 
                  (c)  Form. Notices/advertisements should state, at a minimum, the place, date, and time that the bids or proposals are due, the solicitation number, a contact person that can provide a copy of, and information about, the solicitation, and a brief description of the needed items. 
                  (d)  Time period for submission of bids. A minimum of 30 days shall generally be provided for preparation and submission of sealed bids and 15 days for competitive proposals. However, the county administrator may allow for a shorter period under extraordinary circumstances. 
                  (e)  Cancellation of solicitations. The solicitation of bids or proposals may be cancelled before bids or proposals are due if, in the opinion of the county administrator, the items or services are no longer needed, or if there are errors in the solicitation process. 
                  (Code 1987, § 2-106; Ord. No. 2010-007, § 3.6.0, 7-6-2010) 
                  Sec. 2-105. - Contract pricing arrangements; contract types. 
                  Any type of contract which is appropriate to the procurement and which will promote the best interests of the county board of commissioners may be used. All solicitations and contracts shall include the clauses and provisions necessary to define the rights and responsibilities of both the contractor and the county board of commissioners. 
                  (Code 1987, § 2-107; Ord. No. 2010-007, § 3.7.0, 7-6-2010) 
                  Sec. 2-106. - Contract clauses. 
                  All contracts should identify the contract pricing arrangement as well as other pertinent terms and conditions, as determined by the county board of commissioners. 
                  (Code 1987, § 2-108; Ord. No. 2010-007, § 3.8.0, 7-6-2010) 
                  Sec. 2-107. - Contract administration. 
                  The county board of commissioners shall maintain a system of contract administration designed to ensure that contractors perform in accordance with their contracts. These systems shall provide for inspection of supplies, services, or construction, as well as monitoring contractor performance, status reporting on major projects including construction contracts, and similar matters. For cost-reimbursement contracts, costs are allowable only to the extent that they are consistent with accepted cost principals. The commission may withhold ten percent of the amount requested in each request for reimbursement until of all work and products are delivered and approved by the county administrator. 
                  (Code 1987, § 2-109; Ord. No. 2010-007, § 3.9.0, 7-6-2010) 
                  Sec. 2-108. - Assistance to small and other businesses; required efforts. 
                  Consistent with Presidential Executive Orders 11625, 12138, and 12432, and Section 3 of the Federal Act of 1968, all feasible efforts shall be made to ensure that small and minority owned businesses, women's business enterprises, and other individuals or firms located in or owned in substantial part by persons residing in the area of the county board of commissioners' project are used when possible. 
                  (Code 1987, § 2-110; Ord. No. 2010-007, § 3.10.0, 7-6-2010)

                  All contracts where the base contract amount or any option exceeds $100,000.00 are required to be preapproved by the governing board. In addition, all contract modifications that will bring the total amount of the contract in excess of $100,000.00 require preapproval by the governing board. 
                  (Code 1987, § 2-111; Ord. No. 2010-007, § 3.11.0, 7-6-2010) 
                  Sec. 2-110. - Delegation of contracting to county board of commissioners. 
                  While the county administrator is responsible for ensuring that the county board of commissioners' procurements comply with this policy, the county administrator may delegate all procurements to the county board of commissioners as is necessary and appropriate to conduct the business of the agency. Further, and in accordance with this delegation of county board of commissioners, the county administrator shall, where necessary, establish operational procedures (such as a procurement manual or standard operating procedures) to implement this policy. 
                  (Code 1987, § 2-112; Ord. No. 2010-007, § 3.12.0, 7-6-2010)

                  (a)  The county board of commissioners must maintain records sufficient to detail the significant history of each procurement action. These records shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following: 
                  (1)  Rationale for the method of procurement (if not self-evident); 
                  (2)  Rationale of contract pricing arrangement (also if not self-evident); 
                  (3)  Reason for accepting or rejecting the bids or offers; 
                  (4)  Basis for the contract price;

                  (8)  The governing authority of the county may at any time cause an interim reverification of eligibility prior to the expiration of a Sunday sales permit and if the permit holder is found, as a result of such inquiry, to be no longer qualified under the provisions of this section to hold a Sunday sales permit, the permit shall be revoked or suspended as determined appropriate by the governing authority of the county. 
                  (9)  No permit will be issued under this section or remain in effect unless the permit holder also holds a currently valid license for the sale of alcoholic beverages on the premises issued under this article. If the basic license of the permit holder to sell alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises is suspended or revoked, the permit for Sunday sales issued under this section shall automatically be suspended or revoked, as the case may be. Similarly, the revocation or suspension of any authorization for Sunday sales hereunder shall be grounds for revocation or suspension of the permit holder's basic license for the sale of alcoholic beverages on the premises. 
                  (10)  If any permit holder shall be determined to have furnished materially false information in the application for a Sunday sales permit or in the application for a basic license to sell alcoholic beverages by the drink for consumption on the premises, the governing authority of the county reserves the right to suspend or revoke the Sunday sales permit and, in addition, to take such action as it shall deem appropriate under all of the circumstances with respect to the basic license. 
                  (11)  If the governing authority of the county shall determine that there appears to be reasonable grounds for suspending or revoking a Sunday sales permit, it shall give reasonable notice stating such grounds as are known, and the permit holder shall have no less than three days after the giving of such notice, within which to file with the governing authority, documents opposing or contesting such grounds, and the permit holder shall be entitled to a hearing thereon before the governing authority which, after such hearing, may take such action as shall be just and proper. 
                  (12)  The permit holder shall maintain adequate accounting records kept, if possible, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, but in any event, sufficient to enable the governing authority of the county and its designated agent, to determine with accuracy the relative percentage of total gross annual sales derived from prepared meals and food to alcoholic beverages at the premises. 
                  (13)  Unless otherwise provided in this section, all conditions, requirements, and other provisions imposed by this article and applicable to basic licenses for the sale of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises shall also be applicable to Sunday sales permits issued hereunder. 
                  (b)  The fees to be paid to the county for permits issued under this section shall be as established in a schedule of fees and charges published from time to time by the governing authority of the county. 
                  (c)  The administration of this section shall be supervised and undertaken by such person or department affiliated with the county as may be designated by the county administrator, and wherever herein the terms "responsible agent," "designated agent," or variation thereof is used, the same shall mean and refer to the designee of the county administrator.

                  (a)  Upon the filing of an application and satisfaction of the requirements of this chapter by a bona fide nonprofit civic organization, the responsible agent may issue a temporary license authorizing the bona fide nonprofit civic organization to: 
                  (1)  Serve alcoholic beverages for consumption only on the premises for a period not to exceed three calendar days; and/or 
                  (2)  Auction wine in sealed containers for off-premises consumption. 
                  No more than three permits may be issued to any bona fide nonprofit civic organization in any one calendar year pursuant to this section. Permits issued pursuant to this section shall be valid only for the location, times, and dates specified in the license. No license may be issued unless the sale of alcoholic beverages is lawful in the place for which the license is issued. For the purposes of this section, a "bona fide nonprofit civic organization" is defined as an entity which is exempt from federal income tax pursuant to the provisions of 26 USC 501(c), (d), or (e). 
                  (b)  Bona fide nonprofit civic organizations which hold a temporary license issued pursuant to this section may auction wine in sealed containers for off-premises consumption, which has been donated to the bona fide nonprofit civic organization by a person who does not currently hold a license issued by the state department of revenue pursuant to the Georgia Alcoholic Beverage Code, wine which has been donated by a state licensed retailer, or wine which has been donated or purchased from a state licensed wine wholesaler. The bona fide nonprofit civic organization may ship or otherwise transport to the location specified in the temporary license issued pursuant to subsection (a) of this section wine donated by a person who does not currently hold a license issued by the state department of revenue pursuant to the Georgia Alcoholic Beverage Code or wine donated by a state licensed retailer. State excise tax shall be paid to the state department of revenue on any donated wine. If the bona fide nonprofit civic organization cannot verify, within ten days of the conclusion of the permitted event, that state excise tax for the wine was previously paid to the state department of revenue, the bona fide nonprofit civic organization shall pay to the state department of revenue the appropriate excise tax as required by law. 
                  (c)  The fee to be paid to the county for licenses issued under this section shall be as established in a schedule of fees and charges published from time to time by the governing authority of the county; provided that the initial fee hereunder shall be in an amount as established by the board of county commissioners from time to time. 
                  (d)  Applications for a temporary license authorized under this section shall be made on such forms, and shall require such information, as may be prescribed by the responsible agent from time to time. 
                  (e)  All bona fide nonprofit civic organizations applying for a temporary license under this section shall fully comply with all applicable state and federal laws regarding the scheduled event and the sale, taxation, and transportation of alcoholic beverages. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any bona fide nonprofit civic organization applying for a temporary license under this section shall also apply for and obtain any and all permits or licenses required by state or federal governments in connection with such activities (including, without limitation, the Georgia Alcoholic Beverage Code, O.C.G.A. § 3-1-1 et seq.). 
                  (f)  Unless as otherwise specifically provided in this section, any bona fide nonprofit civic organization holding a temporary permit shall fully comply with all applicable provisions of this article required generally of licenses for the sale of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises; provided, however, that said bona fide nonprofit civic organizations shall not be required to comply with the following sections: 4-12, 4-16, 4-37, and 4-38. 
                  (g)  The administration of this section shall be supervised and undertaken by such persons or departments affiliated with the county as may be designated by the county administrator, and wherever in this section the term "responsible agent" is used, the same shall mean and refer to the designee of the county administrator.

Choke collars and pinch collars are prohibited for the purpose of tethering an animal to a running cable line or trolley system. 
                  f.  The animal is tethered at sufficient distance from any other objects to prevent the tangling of the cable by extending over an object or an edge that could result in injury or strangulation of the animal, and be of sufficient distance from any fence so as to prohibit the animal access to the fence. 
                  g.  The animal has proper food, water, and shelter. Refer to section 6-4.

Such fees, in all events, shall be sufficient for the county to recover its costs incurred in the administration of this chapter. 
                  (b)  Before any fee authorized by this section shall be levied or amended, it must be published in a local newspaper of general circulation at least five days before it shall become effective.

Such refusal shall, when requested, be in writing and shall contain the reason for refusal. 
                  (3)  Special foundation permit. When application for a permit to erect or enlarge a building has been filed and pending issuance of such permit, the chief building official may, at his discretion, issue a special permit for the foundation only. The holder of such a special permit is proceeding at his own risk and without assurance that a permit for the remainder of the work will be granted nor that corrections will not be required in order to meet provisions of the construction codes. 
                  (4)  Public right-of-way. A permit shall not be given by the chief building official for the construction of any building, or for the alteration of any building where said building is to be changed and such change will affect the exterior walls, bays, balconies, or other appendages or projections fronting on any street, alley or public lane, or for the placing on any lot or premises of any building or structure removed from another lot or premises, unless the applicant has made application at the office of the director of road department for the lines of the public street on which he proposes to build, erect or locate said building; and it shall be the duty of the chief building official to see that the street lines are not encroached upon.

                  (e)  Conditions of the permit. 
                  (1)  Permit intent. A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not as authority to violate, cancel, alter, or set aside any of the provisions of the construction codes, nor shall issuance of a permit prevent the chief building official from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction, or violations of the construction codes. Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is commenced within six months after its issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of six months after the time the work is commenced. One or more extensions of time, for periods not more than 90 days each, may be allowed for the permit. The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated. Extensions shall be in writing by the chief building official. 
                  (2)  Permit issued on basis of an affidavit.

                  (3)  Plans. When the chief building official issues a permit, he shall enforce, in writing or by stamp, one set of plans, "Plans Approved." One set of drawings so reviewed shall be retained by the chief building official and the other set shall be returned to the applicant. The permitted drawings shall be kept at the site of work and shall be open to inspection by the chief building official or his authorized representative. 
                  (f)  Fees. 
                  (1)  Prescribed fees. A permit shall not be issued until the fees prescribed by the governing body have been paid. Nor shall an amendment to a permit be released until the additional fee, if any, due to an increase in the estimated cost of the building, structure, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, or gas systems, etc. has been paid. 
                  (2)  Work commencing before permit issuance. Any person who commences any work on a building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing, etc. system before obtaining the necessary permits, shall be subject to a penalty of 100 percent of the usual permit fee in addition to the required permit fees. 
                  (3)  Accounting. The chief building official shall keep or cause to be kept a permanent and accurate accounting of all permit fees and other money collected, the names of all persons upon whose account the same was paid, along with the date and amount thereof.

In all buildings where plaster is used for fire protection purposes, the permit holder or his agent shall notify the chief building official after all lathing and backing is in place. Plaster shall not be applied until the release from the chief building official has been received. 
                  (h)  Certificates. 
                  (1)  Certificate of occupancy. 
                  a.  Building occupancy. A new building shall not be occupied or a change made in the occupancy, nature or use of a building or part of a building until after the chief building official has issued a certificate of occupancy. Said certificate shall not be issued until all required electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing and fire protection systems have been inspected for compliance with the construction codes and other applicable laws and ordinances and released by the chief building official. 
                  b.  Issuing certificate of occupancy. Upon satisfactory completion of all required site improvements, and construction of a building or structure and installation of electrical, gas, mechanical and plumbing systems in accordance with the construction codes, reviewed plans and specifications, and after the final inspection, the chief building official shall issue a certificate of occupancy stating the nature of the occupancy permitted, the number of persons for each floor when limited by law, and the allowable load per square foot for each floor in accordance with the provisions of the construction codes. 
                  c.  Temporary/partial occupancy. A temporary/partial certificate of occupancy may be issued for a portion of a building, which may safely be occupied prior to final completion of the building. 
                  d.  Existing building certificate of occupancy. A certificate of occupancy for any existing building may be obtained by applying to the chief building official and supplying the information and data necessary to determine compliance with the construction codes for the occupancy intended. Where necessary, in the opinion of the chief building official, two sets of detailed drawings, or a general inspection, or both, may be required. When, upon examination and inspection, it is found that the building conforms to the provisions of the construction codes and other applicable laws and ordinances for such occupancy, a certificate of occupancy shall be issued. 
                  (2)  Certificate of completion. Upon satisfactory completion of a building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system, a certificate of completion may be issued. This certificate is proof that a structure or system is complete and for certain types of permits is released for use and may be connected to a utility system. This certificate does not grant authority to occupy or connect a building, such as a shell building, prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
                  (3)  Service utilities. 
                  a.  Connection of service utilities. No person shall make connections from a utility, source of energy, fuel or power to any building or system which is regulated by the construction codes for which a permit is required, until released by the chief building official and a certificate of occupancy or completion is issued. 
                  b.  Temporary connection. The chief building official may authorize the temporary connection of the building or system to the utility source of energy, fuel or power for the purpose of testing building service systems or for use under a temporary certificate of occupancy. 
                  c.  Authority to disconnect service utilities. The chief building official shall have the power to authorized disconnection of utility service to the building, structure or system regulated by the construction codes, in case of emergency where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to life or property. The chief building official shall notify the serving utility, and whenever possible the owner and occupant of the building, structure or service system of the decision to disconnect prior to taking such action. If not notified prior to disconnecting, the owner or occupant of the building, structure or service system shall be notified in writing, as soon as practical thereafter. 
                  (i)  Posting floor loads. 
                  (1)  Occupancy. An existing or new building shall not be occupied for any purpose, which will cause the floors thereof to be loaded beyond their safe capacity. The chief building official may permit occupancy of a building for mercantile, commercial or industrial purposes, by a specific business, when he is satisfied that such capacity will not thereby be exceeded. 
                  (2)  Storage and factory-industrial occupancies. It shall be the responsibility of the owner, agent, proprietor or occupant of Group S and Group F occupancies, or any occupancy where excessive floor loading is likely to occur, to employ a competent architect or engineer in computing the safe load capacity. All such computations shall be accompanied by an affidavit from the architect or engineer stating the safe allowable floor load on each floor in pounds per square foot uniformly distributed. The computations and affidavit shall be filed as a permanent record of the building department. 
                  (3)  Signs required. In every building or part of a building used for storage, industrial or hazardous purposes, the safe floor loads, as reviewed by the chief building official on the plan, shall be marked on plates or approved design which shall be supplied and securely affixed by the owner of the building in a conspicuous place in each story to which they relate. Such plates shall not be removed or defaced, and if lost, removed or defaced, shall be replaced by the owner of the building.

                  DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

                  Sec. 8-65. - Statutory authorization. 
                  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the county board of commissioners does ordain the provisions of this article. 
                  (Code 1987, § 5-40; Ord. No. 2012-002, 3-15-2012) 
                  Sec. 8-66. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Code 1987, § 5-41; Ord. No. 2012-002, 3-15-2012) 
                  Sec. 8-67. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  The objectives of this article are: 
                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  Existing construction means, for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before December 1, 1983 (the effective date of the initial FIRM for this community). 
                  Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before October 27, 1983 (the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by this community). 
                  Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of this article, the term is synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD). 
                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929, is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means, for floodplain management purposes, any structure for which the "start of construction" commenced after October 27, 1983 (the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the county as a basis for community participation in the NFIP), and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after October 27, 1983 (the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by this community). 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD), as corrected in 1988, is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
                  (1)  Built on a single chassis; 
                  (2)  400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
                  (3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
                  (4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: Accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. Note: The market value of the structure should be the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. The term "substantial improvement" includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include either: 
                  (1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
                  (2)  Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, the term "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the structure commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  DIVISION 4. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 8-147. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  Anchoring. New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)  Materials. New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)  Methods. New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater (not applicable in coastal high-hazard areas). 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the lowest floor criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area, and the interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms; 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces; 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  Sec. 8-148. - Specific standards. 
                  In all special flood hazard areas designated as A1-30, AE, AH, and A (with estimated BFE), the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. 
                  a.  Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 8-147(4). 
                  b.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing and other service facilities shall be elevated at/or one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth in this section and in section 8-124(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data is available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: 
                  1.  Individual lots or parcels; 
                  2.  In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions; 
                  3.  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or 
                  4.  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, 
                  must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in either an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (See section 8-147(6).) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect-type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.  Meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (3)(a) and (c) of this section. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 8-98 are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection (4)a. of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division 4.

                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article is met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the board of commissioners shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances. 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and

                  (2)  The provisions of this division are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the board of commissioners may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this division.

                  State waters means any and all rivers, streams, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainage systems, springs, wells, and other bodies of surface or subsurface water, natural or artificial, lying within or forming a part of the boundaries of the state which are not entirely confined and retained completely upon the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation. 
                  Structural erosion, sedimentation and pollution control practices means practices for the stabilization of erodible or sediment-producing areas by utilizing the mechanical properties of matter for the purpose of either changing the surface of the land or storing, regulating or disposing of runoff to prevent excessive sediment loss. Examples of structural erosion and sediment control practices are riprap, sediment basins, dikes, level spreaders, waterways or outlets, diversions, grade stabilization structures and sediment traps, etc. Such practices can be found in the publication Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia. 
                  Trout streams means all streams or portions of streams within the watershed as designated by the Wildlife Resources Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources under the provisions of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 in the rules and regulations for Water Quality Control, Chapter 391-3-6 at www.epd.georgia.gov. Streams designated as primary trout waters are defined as water supporting a self-sustaining population of rainbow, brown or brook trout. Streams designated as secondary trout waters are those in which there is no evidence of natural trout reproduction, but are capable of supporting trout throughout the year. First order trout waters are streams into which no other streams flow except springs. 
                  Vegetative erosion and sedimentation control measures mean the measures for the stabilization of erodible or sediment-producing areas by covering the soil with: 
                  (1)  Permanent seeding, sprigging or planting, producing long-term vegetative cover; or 
                  (2)  Temporary seeding, producing short-term vegetative cover; or 
                  (3)  Sodding, covering areas with a turf of perennial sod-forming grass. 
                  Such measures can be found in the publication Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia. 
                  Watercourse means any natural or artificial watercourse, stream, river, creek, channel, ditch, canal, conduit, culvert, drain, waterway, gully, ravine, or wash in which water flows either continuously or intermittently and which has a definite channel, bed and banks, and including any area adjacent thereto subject to inundation by reason of overflow or floodwater. 
                  Wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.

                  (3)  Such minor land-disturbing activities as home gardens and individual home landscaping, repairs, maintenance work, fences, and other related activities which result in minor soil erosion; 
                  (4)  The construction of single-family residences, when such construction disturbs less than one acre and is not a part of a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre and not otherwise exempted under this section; provided, however, that construction of any such residence shall conform to the minimum requirements as set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 and this section. For single-family residence construction covered by the provisions of this section, there shall be a buffer zone between the residence and any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. In any such buffer zone, no land-disturbing activity shall be constructed between the residence and the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action from the banks of the trout waters. For primary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. For secondary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, but the director may grant variances to no less than 25 feet. Regardless of whether a trout stream is primary or secondary, for first order trout waters, which are streams into which no other streams flow except for springs, the buffer shall be at least 25 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. The minimum requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b) and the buffer zones provided by this section shall be enforced by the local issuing authority;

                  Sec. 8-183. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(2) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsection (c)(15) and (16) of this section, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  Minimum protections and best management practices. The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in subsection (16) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year-round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12 (O.C.G.A.§ 12-5-440 et seq.), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. A 25-foot buffer shall also exist adjacent to all saltwater marsh as delineated by the department of natural resources. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented for: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines; 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed. 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (17)  There is established a 25 foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to code section [O.C.G.A.] 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to code section [O.C.G.A.] 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25 foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "Minor Buffer Impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
                  (18)  There is established along impaired streams and those streams segments identified by the governing authority(s) and as listed in Exhibit A [3] and illustrated on a map maintained by LCPC an additional 25 feet undisturbed vegetative buffer or an additional 15 feet of permanent grass planted in accordance with the manual. These buffers are measured horizontally beginning 25 feet from the point of wrested vegetation and the requirements for buffers as described in (16) and (17) above. 
                  (19)  Land disturbing activities shall not be conducted within the 100-year floodplain unless compliance with any applicable local floodplain management ordinance is demonstrated or such construction is in compliance with the Federal Emergency Management Agency regulations. 
                  (20)  Comprehensive construction sequencing plan. A comprehensive construction sequencing plan shall be created during the preconstruction stage. This plan describes the sequence of each construction activity and phase. It allows for the coordination of simultaneous operations and planning of the activity sequence while taking the opportunity to consider different equipment and strategies. A comprehensive construction sequencing plan should address items such as the timing of the installation of sediment basins and installation of erosion control structures and devices. This plan must be submitted prior to the issuance of a land disturbing activity permit as part of the construction site plan or as a separate document as needed. 
                  (d)  Stream buffer requirements exceeding established minimums. Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  Injury to property. The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

                  Sec. 8-184. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  Generally. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal of the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the county without first obtaining a permit from the local issuing authority to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the local issuing authority and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section (c). Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 8-183(b) and (c) will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10 (Ga. Comp. R. and Regs. § 391-9-7-.10). 
                  (3)  A fee as published by the county board of commissioners shall be charged for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area. 
                  (4)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a), half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (5)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 8-183(c)(15) and (16) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6) of this section have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (6)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (7)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 8-183(b) and (c) ; or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 8-183(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(7) of this section are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1).

                  Sec. 8-185. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The local issuing authority will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)  The local issuing authority shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  (a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  (b)  Stop-work orders. 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and 
                  (3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  (4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop-work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his designee. All such stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop-work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 8-184(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any city charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article under county ordinances approved under this article shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

                  (a)  Neither the approval of a plan under the provisions of this article, nor the compliance with provisions of this article shall relieve any person from the responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by law nor impose any liability upon the local issuing authority or district for damage to any person or property. 
                  (b)  The fact that a land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (c)  No provision of this article shall permit any persons to violate the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act or the rules and regulations promulgated and approved thereunder or pollute any waters of the state as defined thereby.

                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Regulated activity means any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States excepting those activities exempted in Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 
                  Wetland means an area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and distribution sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, commonly known as hydrophilic vegetation. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. 
                  Wetland protection district means all wetlands within the jurisdiction of the county, as indicated on the wetlands map; provided, however, that the wetlands map does not necessarily represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the county and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
                  Wetlands map means the current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory maps for Liberty County, Georgia.

                  An U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required prior to the issuance of a permit for any regulated activity within the wetland protection district. If the corps determines that wetlands are present and that a Section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, no permit for the regulated activity will be issued until the corps has issued the Section 404 permit or letter of permission. If the corps determines that there are no wetlands present on the proposed development site, the county may proceed with its normal permitting procedures.

                  Species diversity means a planting or retention of diverse tree species on a site or within the community to prevent dominance by any single type of tree. Species diversity is intended to prevent the destruction of the entire urban forest in the event of disease or pestilence. 
                  Tree easement means an easement, not less than ten feet in width, and such easement shall not be in conflict with any other planning requirements as set forth under the zoning and subdivision regulations, pertaining to the public planting and/or maintenance of canopy street trees, exclusive of utility, drainage or other easements. Administrative approval is required for easements greater than ten feet in width. 
                  Tree establishment plan means a map and supporting documentation, which describes for a particular site where existing trees are to be planted in compliance with the requirements of these regulations, the types of trees and their corresponding tree quality points. 
                  Tree fund means a fund maintained by the county for the purpose of planting required trees. An owner, developer, and/or building permit applicant may contribute to such a fund. 
                  Tree protection plan means a map and supporting documentation which describes for a particular site where existing trees are to be retained in compliance with the requirements as set forth in these regulations, the types of trees and their corresponding tree quality points. 
                  Tree protection zone means the area surrounding a preserved or planted tree that is essential to that tree's health and survival, and is protected within the guidelines as set forth in these regulations. 
                  Tree quality point means a unit of measurement, which quantifies the relative value of trees that are planted or retained on a given site. Tree quality points quantitatively express the desirable qualities of the species with respect to size for each tree that is retained on a site. For planted trees, tree quality points are an expression of species desirability and the expected mature size of each tree. 
                  Vegetative practices means the measures taken in an effort to stabilize erodible soil or sediment by producing areas by covering the soil with plantings such as: 
                  (1)  Permanent seeding, sprigging, or planting producing long-term vegetative cover; 
                  (2)  Short-term seeding, producing temporary vegetative cover; or

                  Subdivision I. - In General 

                  Sec. 8-272. - Tree protection and tree establishment. 
                  (a)  Protection of preserved or planted trees. Tree protection zones shall be established and maintained on a site for all trees, reserved or planted, for which tree quality points are to be claimed. The following provisions apply to such zones and the trees within them: 
                  (1)  A tree protection plan and details shall accompany all applications for land clearing and/or land-disturbing activities. The tree protection plan shall identify where and how existing trees are to be protected during clearing and construction of the project. Such tree protection plan and details shall be approved by the administrator upon a finding that the plan adequately addresses the problems of the site in protecting the existing trees. 
                  (2)  The area within any tree protection zone shall remain open and unpaved. The use of perforated pavers may be allowed subject to the approval of the administrator. 
                  (3)  No vehicles shall be parked, or construction material stored or substances poured or disposed of or placed, within any tree protection zone at any time during clearing or construction of the project. 
                  (4)  No change in grade within the tree protection zone shall be allowed around existing trees except for a maximum addition of two inches of mulch unless approved by the administrator. 
                  (5)  To protect preserved trees from grade changes, which result in changes of water supply to the tree protection zone, tree wells or tree walls (islands) shall be constructed as needed. Adequate means for drainage of excess moisture from the tree protection zone shall be provided where tree wells or tree walls are constructed. 
                  (6)  All retained or planted trees shall be protected or situated so as to prevent damage to the trees from environmental changes (such as a lower water table) or land disturbance resulting from any building or facility construction within or immediately adjacent to the critical root zones of the trees. 
                  (7)  No artificial plants, trees, or like materials shall be counted toward meeting the standards of this article. 
                  (8)  For planted trees, the following tree protection standards and requirements shall apply: 
                  a.  The minimum size tree protection zone centered upon the planted tree shall be as specified in Table 1 as follows: 
                  TABLE 1  MINIMUM TREE PROTECTION ZONE 

                   
                  b.  No tree shall be planted closer to a building foundation or water, sewer, or natural gas line, than as follows: 
                  1.  Five feet for a small tree species. 
                  2.  Ten feet for a medium tree species. 
                  3.  Ten feet for a large tree species. 
                  c.  No tree shall be planted under overhead utility distribution lines where the average mature height of the tree is greater than the lowest overhead wire. 
                  (9)  Irrigation requirements. Except as provided for herein, irrigation shall be provided for tree protection zones in the following manner: 
                  a.  A permanent water source shall be installed not less than 100 feet from each tree protection zone, but shall not encroach more than 12 inches into any tree protection zone. 
                  b.  All trees within a tree protection zone must have: 
                  1.  A permanent water source within 100 feet; or 
                  2.  A permanent water source at the perimeter of the tree protection zone where that tree protection zone has a radius of greater than 100 feet. 
                  c.  The minimum permanent water source permissible under these provisions shall be a hose bib capable of delivering a minimum of three gallons per minute. 
                  d.  All irrigation systems connected to any potable water supply shall prevent contamination of the potable water supply according to county standards; provided however, irrigation shall not be required where: 
                  1.  Existing individual trees or clumps or groups of existing trees or wooded areas are to be preserved and grading, filling or other land-disturbing activities have not disturbed the natural ground water supply to such trees; or 
                  2.  For planted trees it is determined by the administrator that the natural condition is sufficient to sustain tree growth. 
                  (b)  Standards and specifications; tree quality points. 
                  (1)  Basis for assigning tree quality points to preserved or planted trees. 
                  a.  All preserved trees must be greater than four inches DBH to qualify for tree quality points. 
                  b.  All large trees, except for conifers, must be at least two-inch caliper to qualify for tree quality points when planted on the site. 
                  c.  All coniferous, including, but not limited to, pines, cedars, and cypress, trees and all medium or small trees must be a minimum of one-inch caliper to qualify for tree quality points when planted on the site. 
                  d.  If multi-trunk trees are planted or preserved the largest trunk only shall qualify for tree quality points. 
                  e.  All planted trees shall conform to the most recent edition of the American Standard for Nursery Stock (as written by the American Association of Nurserymen). Topped trees shall not be considered for tree quality points. 
                  f.  Lifting or moving trees without adequate support to the root ball shall be sufficient grounds to reject the trees for tree quality points award. 
                  g.  Greater than 50 percent scaffold limbs per tree exhibiting included bark shall be cause for rejection of the tree. 
                  (2)  Tree quality points for planted trees. Tree quality points are assigned to newly planted trees as defined in Table 2. The species listed are contained in the tree quality points list published and maintained by the administrator. 
                  TABLE 2  TREE QUALITY POINTS FOR PLANTED TREES 

                   
                  A listing of small, medium and large trees is found within the tree quality points list maintained by the administrator. 
                  (3)  Tree quality points for preserved trees. Tree quality points for trees preserved on the site are directly related to the tree species quality and the tree protection zone that must be provided for the tree. Tree quality points for preserved trees are calculated by squaring the tree's diameter at breast height (DBH) and multiplying this number by the applicable tree quality points factor. The mathematical formula is: 
                  (DBH) 2 × (Quality Points Factor) = Tree Quality Points 
                  The tree quality points factor is found in Table 3. 
                  TABLE 3  TREE QUALITY POINTS FACTOR 

                   
                  (4)  Tree quality points for preserved stands of trees. The preservation of mature native stands of trees and understory vegetation shall have the value of 0.25 tree quality points and 0.10 landscape quality points per square foot of preserved area. To determine if a stand of trees should be preserved and assigned tree quality points, the following specifications shall apply: 
                  a.  The administrator shall visit the site in order to verify that the stand contains native or extant trees of sufficient size, quantity and quality to warrant reservation as a stand. The administrator shall review the types of tree species located on the site, the quantity of trees within each species, the degree of crown closure and the trees' condition. Stands found by the administrator to contain an insufficient number of mature native trees shall not qualify for quality points under preserved stand calculations. Individual trees, found by the administrator to be unacceptable as a preserved stand, may qualify for tree quality points on an individual basis if the critical root systems of individual trees remain intact. 
                  b.  The stand shall be integrated into a tree protection, tree establishment and landscape plan. 
                  c.  All existing vegetation shall be left within the preserved stand with the exception of hazardous trees. No clearing of underbrush shall be permitted. 
                  d.  The preserved stand shall be protected during the construction period using the same standards and specifications as required for a tree protection zone. 
                  e.  Such preserved stand shall be considered a set-aside and shall be shown within a permanent, recorded tree conservation easement. 
                  (5)  Tree quality points for palm-type trees. Palm-type trees shall be assigned two tree quality points per foot of stem height up to ten feet, regardless of whether the tree is preserved or planted on the site. 
                  (6)  Landscape quality points for small and medium trees, shrubs and ground cover and vines. 
                  a.  Landscape quality points shall be given for planted medium and small trees, shrubs, ground cover and vines on new commercial, industrial, office, institutional, and multifamily developments. Tree quality points for preserved medium and small trees may also qualify towards the 400 landscape quality point per acre requirement. To qualify, shrubs shall be planted in a container of a minimum of three gallons. If a shrub is incorporated into a buffer, it must be capable of meeting the height requirements of the buffer within a twelve-month period. 
                  b.  All planted trees shall conform to the most recent edition of the American Standard for Nursery Stock (written by the American Association of Nurserymen). Topped trees shall not be considered for tree quality points. 
                  c.  Lifting or moving trees without adequate support to the root ball shall be sufficient grounds to reject the trees for tree quality points. 
                  _____ 
                  d.  Table 4 includes types of material acceptable for landscape quality points: 
                  TABLE 4  LANDSCAPING QUALITY POINTS PER ACRE 

                   
                  (c)  Continuing obligation for maintenance. The following maintenance standards apply to all trees, which are planted or preserved on a site in order to meet the minimum tree and landscape quality point requirements as set forth in this section. Other trees on the site are exempt from these requirements. 
                  (1)  Any damage or injury occurring to a preserved tree, by determination of the administrator, sufficient to cause the tree to die within five years or develop into an irreparable hazard tree, shall be removed and shall lose tree quality points. Any tree so removed from the site shall be replaced with a tree of equal or greater tree quality points. 
                  (2)  Damage not considered by the administrator to be fatal to a preserved tree or hazardous to the public shall be immediately repaired but shall result in a proportional decrease in tree quality points, where applicable. 
                  (3)  The property owner shall be solely responsible for watering and fertilizing trees in order to maintain tree health and vigor. Failure to maintain the required number of tree quality points on the property shall be a violation of this article. 
                  (d)  Trees adjacent to county-owned property. 
                  (1)  A property owner responsible for any land-disturbing activity within proximity to the critical root zone of a tree located on county property shall provide for the protection of such tree to the standards described in this article. All work on county rights-of-way requires a permit from the county, and violations are subject to an immediate stop-work order. 
                  (2)  If a tree is recommended for removal from a county right-of-way by other county agencies, the administrator shall participate in the review process. Any tree removal on county property shall be coordinated with the administrator, and issues of mitigation for the tree removal shall be addressed by the administrator. 
                  (3)  A property owner responsible for a land-disturbing activity that causes damage to a tree on county property which affects the health or growth of such tree, or removes a tree, shall compensate the county for such tree loss or damage as set forth below: 
                  a.  The administrator shall assess tree quality points for the removed or damaged tree. The property owner responsible for the land-disturbing activity, which caused the removal or damage to such tree shall compensate the county for such tree loss or damage under one of the following options, subject to the approval of the administrator: 
                  1.  Plant or preserve additional trees on the development site which equal or exceed the value of the tree quality points previously assessed to the removed or damaged tree. 
                  2.  Plant trees on adjacent county rights-of-way that equal or exceed the value of the tree quality points that were assessed for the removed or damaged tree. The property owner shall coordinate with the administrator to select the species, set up a plant acceptance date and to have the administrator observe the planting of the tree. 
                  3.  Donate a gift-in-kind to the county tree fund, for a tree whose value equals or exceeds the value of the tree quality points that were assessed for the removed or damaged tree. 
                  4.  Meet any equivalent combination of the above as approved by the administrator. 
                  b.  Once the administrator has approved a method for compensating the county for the damaged tree, the owner of the development shall submit to the administrator, for approval, a revised tree protection and tree establishment plan incorporating the approved tree compensation plan. 
                  (e)  Designation of exceptional trees. Trees designated exceptional shall thereafter be considered a public landmark and shall not be destroyed or endangered. The following procedures and criteria shall be applied in determining whether a tree shall be designated an exceptional tree. 
                  (1)  All nominations for exceptional tree designation shall be reviewed by the administrator who shall make recommendation on such nomination to the board of commissioners. The board of commissioners may, on their own initiative or upon a petition, designate a tree as "exceptional," as defined in this article. 
                  (2)  The designation of an exceptional tree shall be based upon an evaluation of the tree in relation to one or more of the following criteria: 
                  a.  Sufficient facts have been presented to the board of commissioners to demonstrate that the tree has an association with a documented historical event, or is located on an historic site. 
                  b.  The tree has unusually high aesthetic value. 
                  c.  The tree possesses unique characteristics because of its age, species, variety, location, or the size and development of its crown, trunk, or main stem. 
                  (3)  All trees, at the time of designation, as an exceptional tree shall meet all of the following criteria: 
                  a.  The tree is free of disease, pests and other serious injury. 
                  b.  The tree has a life expectancy of more than ten years. 
                  c.  The tree is free from structural defects, which would present a hazard to the public. 
                  (4)  Protection. Upon designation as an exceptional tree, the tree shall be protected from land-clearing activities, as provided in this section, and the tree quality points assigned to the tree shall be based upon a tree quality points factor of 2.5 (60 percent more tree quality points than a preferred tree of equal DBH).

                  (1)  Street trees. Street trees may be planted or preserved within the front yard development setback, provided they can be placed within a tree easement established pursuant to the provisions of the county subdivision regulations, and such tree does not conflict with any existing utility, drainage or other easements. Street trees located within tree easements will be maintained by the county. 
                  (2)  Front yard development setback. Understory and canopy trees may be preserved and/or planted in this area. A portion of the 400 landscape quality points per acre may be planted in this area to correspond with county requirements for buffers so as to screen parking areas from adjacent roadways. 
                  (3)  Parking areas. 
                  a.  A minimum of 1,200 tree quality points per acre in canopy trees shall be planted and/or preserved within landscaped islands and medians located between parking bays. Vegetation qualifying for landscape quality points may also be planted in these areas. 
                  b.  Canopy trees planted in parking islands shall have 400 square feet of unpaved soil for root development. The standard tree island shall be 20 feet by 20 feet; provided, however, that where the islands are an extension of a ten-foot wide landscape median, the islands may be reduced in width to 16 feet. Islands shall not be separated by more than 12 parking spaces, including the landscaped ends of drive aisles. 
                  (4)  Buffers. Existing and/or planted canopy trees, understory trees, and planted evergreen shrubs may be incorporated into buffer areas otherwise required pursuant to the Code of Ordinances of Liberty County and/or the Zoning Ordinance of Liberty County. Landscape and/or tree quality points shall be counted for planting in buffer areas provided such vegetation meets the principles and standards as set forth in this article. 
                  (5)  Areas adjacent to buildings. Plantings adjacent to buildings shall be eligible for tree and landscape quality points if it meets the principles and standards set forth in this article. 
                  (6)  Set-asides and/or stands of trees. Set-aside areas made up of existing stands of trees and understory vegetation shall be eligible for tree and landscape quality points if they meet the principles and standards set forth in this article. 
                  (e)  Landscaping standards. 
                  (1)  The required 400 landscape quality points per acre shall be provided through the planting of medium trees, small trees, shrubs, ground cover and/or vines on the site. 
                  (2)  To qualify for landscape quality points such plantings may be located in the following areas: 
                  a.  Front yard development setback. 
                  b.  Parking area islands and medians. 
                  c.  Buffers. 
                  d.  Areas adjacent to buildings. 
                  e.  Set-asides and/or stands of trees. 
                  (f)  Special cases. 
                  (1)  Insufficient space for trees and/or landscaping on site. 
                  a.  Where circumstances prevent locating the required 1,600 tree quality points per acre on the site, such trees shall either be located as close to the site as practicable, with approval from the administrator, or a contribution shall be made to the county tree fund for the planting and maintenance of such trees elsewhere in the community. However, before this provision shall apply, it must be demonstrated to the administrator that the trees and landscaping cannot be accommodated on the site. 
                  b.  Where circumstances prevent locating the required 400 landscape quality points per acre on the site, a contribution may be made to the county tree fund for the planting and maintenance of trees within the community. 
                  (2)  Automobile, boat, trailer, and similar sales lots. The requirement of canopy cover in the outdoor display, sales and storage areas may be waived for such uses only if the requirements have been met elsewhere on the site. The required 400 landscape quality points per acre, however, shall be provided in this area to break up large expanses of pavement. 
                  a.  Employee and customer parking areas shall be clearly delineated to separate them from outdoor display, sales, and storage areas. Such parking areas shall provide a minimum of 1,200 tree quality points per acre in canopy trees and 400 landscape quality points per acre in landscaping. 
                  b.  Porous paving may be used within outdoor display, sales and parking areas to provide root growth area for new and existing trees. 
                  (3)  Cellular phone towers. Due to the size and location of many cellular tower sites, it is often impracticable to plant the required landscaping on the site; therefore, the administrator may approve any of the following three alternatives: 
                  a.  Planting large canopy trees within the front yard setback along the roadways if there are no conflicting utility locations. The required tree and landscape quality points may be combined together to provide tree quality points for the site. 
                  b.  When utilities or site constraints do not allow planting within the front yard setback, plantings may be approved off-site at other locations within the immediate neighborhood. Trees may be planted either in the county right-of-way where there are no utilities, or in street tree easements on private property. 
                  c.  When there are no viable locations either on site or within the immediate vicinity, a contribution may be made to the county tree fund. 
                  (4)  Stormwater detention areas. Where planting within a stormwater detention area will help it function more efficiently and help make the detention area more visually attractive, such plantings are permitted subject to the following conditions: 
                  a.  The centerline of the trough of a storm drainage easement shall remain free of debris and plantings, with the exception of grasses or ground cover material, which stabilizes the bare soil. This area shall be maintained so that the flow of water is not impeded. Plantings of shrubbery and trees shall be maintained at a distance of a minimum of ten feet, or as approved by the administrator, from the centerline of the trough so as to keep the area clear for water flow. 
                  b.  The area immediately surrounding drainage structures, including, but not limited to, grates, inlets and weirs shall be kept free from plantings and mulch to keep debris from clogging the structures and impeding the flow of water. All trees and shrubs shall be maintained at a distance of a minimum of ten feet from such structures. 
                  c.  All trees in the immediately surrounding area of a storm detention area shall be kept a minimum distance of ten feet from the centerline of the basin, or one-third the width of the basin floor, whichever is greater. 
                  d.  Shrubbery shall be excluded from the basin floor and banks. Shrubs may be planted at the top of the basin where there is no likelihood of the rootballs lifting out of the ground when the basin is filled with water. 
                  e.  Vegetation for drainage basin areas. Species of vegetation to be planted in or near detention basins and drainage ways are to be reviewed and approved by the administrator. 
                  (g)  Development and expansion of existing property. One thousand six hundred tree quality points per acre and 400 landscape quality points per acre shall be provided for that portion which is being developed.

                  (b)  The administrator shall do a final inspection of all trees and landscaping for completeness prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. 
                  (c)  A temporary performance bond shall be posted by the owner/developer for tree and/or landscape installation which cannot be planted due to continued construction, improper planting season, or such other reasonable factor beyond the owner's immediate control. A bond or letter of credit equal to the amount necessary to complete the work shall be posted with the administrator. A deadline for completion of work shall be scheduled with the administrator in writing, prior to the issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy. 
                  (d)  When the administrator makes a final inspection of the trees and landscaping on the scheduled day for the completion of work, if the work has been completed, the temporary performance bond shall be refunded or applied towards the two-year landscape establishment bond at the request of the owner. However, if the planting of trees and/or landscaping is not complete at the scheduled deadline, the temporary performance bond shall be withheld based upon the amount of incomplete work. 
                  (e)  Posting of a two-year landscape establishment bond shall take place prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. The bond shall be submitted to the administrator for tracking purposes for closure of files and tracking of the two-year landscape bond release.

                  Sec. 10-3. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The county is subject to periodic inundation which could result in loss of life or property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damages. 
                  (c)  Increased velocities and quantities of water draining off developed land causes erosion, sedimentation and maintenance problems resulting in significant damages. 
                  (d)  Uncontrolled stormwater drainage can increase the incidence of flooding and the level of floods which occur, endangering roads, other public and private property and human life. 
                  (e)  Altered land surfaces can change the rate and volume of runoff. 
                  (f)  Many future problems can be avoided through proper stormwater management. 
                  (g)  Every parcel of real property, both public and private, either uses or benefits from the maintenance of a storm sewer system. 
                  (h)  Current and anticipated growth will contribute to and increase the need for improvement and maintenance of the storm sewer system. 
                  (Code 1987, § 6.5-3; Ord. of 5-21-1996, § 17-2)

                  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote, protect, maintain and enhance the short-term and long-term public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion, flood heights or velocities; 
                  (2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damages at the time of initial construction; 
                  (3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, wetlands, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Comply with state (DNR) and federal (EPA) stormwater regulations developed pursuant to the Clean Water Act. These requirements include: 
                  a.  Control the contribution of pollutants to the storm sewer system by stormwater discharges associated with commercial and industrial activity and the quality of stormwater discharged from sites of commercial and industrial activity; 
                  b.  Prohibit illicit connections to storm sewers; 
                  c.  Control discharge to storm sewers of spills, dumping or disposal of materials other than stormwater; and 
                  d.  Control, through intergovernmental agreements, contribution of pollutants from one county system to another.

                  The enactment and enforcement of this article is intended to address the following policy objectives: 
                  (1)  To recognize the necessity of and to encourage joint action and a full exchange of information by the county and the development industry in resolution of existing drainage problems, the prevention of their worsening or recurrence and the implementation of these objectives; 
                  (2)  To work in a cooperative relationship with the development industry to accomplish the above stated objective by encouraging through this chapter and other public actions the development of on-site self-maintaining retention/detention facilities and for off-site centrally located regional retention/detention facilities; 
                  (3)  To maintain, where feasible, the natural environment of county streams through reduction of flow quantities resulting from new development and, where feasible, restore the floodplain to its natural functional purpose to resolve existing flooding problems, but recognize the necessity of using urban streams for stormwater runoff in those situations where maintenance of the natural stream environment would result in continuation or worsening of flooding conditions; 
                  (4)  To incrementally assume maintenance responsibility for the public drainage system; 
                  (5)  To require of the development industry the responsibility to maintain the functioning of the storm drainage system; 
                  (6)  To encourage the construction of joint retention/detention ponds serving several properties which can be accepted for maintenance by the county upon completion of project development. The county encourages (where engineering judgment so warrants) the location of these retention facilities off the site of the property under development and may participate in the construction of major retention facilities which would serve not only the needs of the property under development, but would assist in resolving existing flooding problems; 
                  (7)  To encourage innovative design solutions to the effective retention and reduction of runoff. Drainage control measures to retain, reduce and regulate the rate of stormwater discharge which shall be acceptable shall include, but need not be limited to, retention/detention ponds percolation facilities, parking lots, open space areas, and oversized storm drains with restricted outlets. In addition, the county encourages the development of retention facilities in such a manner that they will become aesthetically and recreationally beneficial to the community in which they are located; and 
                  (8)  To require any development to retain any runoff which exceeds an allowable increase of one cubic foot per second per acre caused by the development and to utilize the parking area or privately owned retention/detention facility.

                  ARTICLE III. - DRAINAGE 

                  Sec. 10-59. - Minimum standards. 
                  (a)  For the MS4 service areas only, water quality goals and objectives contained in the latest edition of the Coastal Stormwater Supplement to the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual (CSS), and any relevant local addenda, will be followed in design of stormwater systems. This section is not intended to interfere with, modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law. The requirements of this section should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this section imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
                  (b)  All engineering design items for storm drainage and erosion control and sedimentation control and delineation of the 100-year floodplains shall meet the applicable minimum requirements available from the county engineering department. Rainfall intensities used in hydrologic computations shall not be less than shown by applicable rainfall curves published by the National Weather Service for the affected area. 
                  (c)  A combination of storage and controlled release of stormwater runoff shall be required for all development and construction which will increase the peak rate of runoff from the site by more than one cubic foot per second for a 25-year frequency (type II) storm. This shall not apply to individual single-family lots of less than two acres. 
                  (d)  The release rate of stormwater from all developments where detention is required shall: 
                  (1)  Not exceed the peak stormwater runoff rate from the area in its existing state for all intensities up to and including the 25-year frequency for all durations of rainfall; or 
                  (2)  Not be greater than that calculated for a 25-year (type II) frequency storm with a runoff coefficient of 0.20, 0.25 and 0.35 for land with an average slope of up to two percent. 
                  (e)  The drainage system being developed shall have adequate capacity to accommodate the flow from all upstream areas for a (type II) storm of 25-year design frequency except for areas considered to be major drainage canals. The major drainage canals shall have adequate capacity to accommodate the flow from all upstream areas for a storm of 100-year frequency. 
                  (f)  Land uses within the 100-year floodplain shall not diminish or restrict the capacity of the channels or floodplains of the stream, its tributaries, drainage ditches or any other drainage facilities or systems and shall not increase the 100-year elevation or velocity or concentration of flow in downstream areas. If the required hydrologic studies reveal that a request for filling or grading within the 100-year floodplain would overload the capacity of the channel downstream or increase flood stages upstream, the development permit shall be denied unless equivalent flow and storage capacity is replaced and maintained by the owner within the 100-year floodplain. Altered sections of the 100-year floodplain shall have a positive slope so as to provide positive drainage back to the stream flow-line and this section must be maintained by the owners in perpetuity so as to prevent or remove silt build-up. 
                  (g)  The live retention storage to be provided shall be calculated on the basis of the 25-year frequency rainfall as published by the National Weather Service for the affected areas. The retention system required shall be that necessary to handle the runoff of a 25-year rainfall, for any and all durations from the proposed development, with a release rate that does not exceed the predevelopment runoff. Retention control structures and other drainage improvements shall be located and designed to prevent erosion damage to adjacent property owners. Retention/detention control structures shall be sized for the release rate as presented in previous sections and will have provisions for overflow of the 100-year storm without damage to the structure. 
                  (h)  When the developer requests and the county engineering department determines that development and construction projects are too small, or that engineering and economic factors make combined retention or other drainage facilities more practical, the county may authorize the joint construction of these facilities to serve two or more properties by two or more developers. This authorization shall be granted by the county engineering department upon application for approval being submitted through the planning commission. Where joint retention facilities serving two or more properties are approved for construction, no use of land or occupancy of buildings within the properties served by these facilities shall be permitted until completion of the retention facility, except upon approval of the county engineering department. 
                  (i)  When adequacy of existing drainage structures is being considered in association with proposed development, the overall capacity of the structure will be evaluated and divided among upstream properties. The available capacity will be divided among property owners based on acreage in the basin. Under no condition will the available capacity of the structure be exceeded. Should the developer desire to replace the structure in lieu of retention/detention, all downstream structures should be evaluated and deemed adequate. 
                  (j)  The following requirements shall apply to the installation, development and maintenance of all stormwater management facilities: 
                  (1)  Permanent chainlink fencing at least six feet in height shall be required around all these facilities. This fencing shall be designed, installed and maintained to allow the free flow of runoff and sediment (if intended) into the facility. The fence shall include a lockable gate of sufficient size to permit entrance of equipment necessary to allow periodic maintenance activities (12 minimum). Different fencing material may be substituted for chainlink upon approval of the county engineering department. 
                  (2)  These facilities shall be located on tracts of land, designated for this use on the recorded plat, with sufficient area around the perimeter to provide access for maintenance purposes and shall be immediately adjacent to or be provided with an access easement to a public street. The access easement shall provide at least 20 feet of width outside of aboveground obstructions including trees, utility poles, fences, buildings, headwalls, weirs, settling basins, top of slope or other drainage structures. 
                  (3)  Perforated standpipes or a French drain, as approved by the county engineer, or other methods which will achieve equal performance to prevent standing of water and/or inadequate drainage shall be installed within all these facilities. 
                  (4)  Except as provided in subsection (j)(5) of this section, the property owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of these retention facilities during grading, construction and following final approval of the completed project. This maintenance obligation shall be binding on future owners, successors and assigns of the property. 
                  (5)  In the case of single-family residential subdivisions approved after the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, the county shall assume maintenance responsibility two years after the release of subdivision streets. A special drainage district as authorized by 1972 Ga. Laws, page 1552 will be established for property in a single-family residential subdivision at the time the plat is finally recorded and will be so noted on the plat. Upon completion of developer maintenance, all detention ponds shall have a positive slope to the outlet in order to facilitate complete drainage. 
                  (6)  These facilities in single-family residential subdivisions constructed under permits issued prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived will not be accepted for county maintenance unless individually approved and accepted by the board of commissioners and suitable access easements are provided. At the time the board of commissioners accepts a retention facility for county maintenance, a special drainage district may be established that includes all properties for which the retention facility is designed. 
                  (7)  Pursuant to the creation of special drainage districts by the county as authorized by Georgia Laws 1972, page 1552, revenues to fund county maintenance of retention facilities may be obtained by an ad valorem tax on all properties for which the retention facilities are designed. Such ad valorem millage rates may be set annually by the board of commissioners when other ad valorem millage rates are set. No assessment will be made in a special drainage district in the calendar year in which it is established. 
                  (k)  Items required to be included in the drainage plan. 
                  (1)  A vicinity map with an indicating north arrow, scale, boundary lines of site, the land lot and district numbers, and other information necessary to locate the development site.

                  (17)  Certification by the person responsible for the land-disturbing activity that the activity will be accomplished pursuant to the approved plan, and responsible personnel will be assigned to the project. 
                  (18)  The name, address and telephone number of the developer/owner. 
                  (19)  The name, address and telephone number of a 24-hour, local contact responsible for stormwater runoff controls. 
                  (20)  Maintenance statement: "Stormwater runoff control measures will be maintained at all times. Additional stormwater runoff control measures will be installed if deemed necessary by on-site inspection." 
                  (21)  All maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature/seal of a professional engineer. 
                  (l)  All buildings located adjacent to or in the 100-year floodplain shall be constructed in accordance with chapter 8, article III, flood damage prevention. 
                  (m)  Special drainage system maintenance requirements. 
                  (1)  No impoundment of water which retains in excess of 0.5 acre feet of runoff shall be removed without first obtaining a development permit, which shall only be issued after competent engineering studies provided by the developer show that this removal will not adversely affect downstream properties. 
                  (2)  Trash, garbage, construction materials, construction by-products or other debris shall not be deposited in any part of the drainage system. 
                  (3)  No restrictions or barriers, including fences, may be placed in the drainage system without first obtaining a development permit. When on- or off-site debris has accumulated within a floodplain in such a manner as to interfere with the free flow of water so as to increase the risk of hazardous inundation of upstream properties adjacent to the floodplain, the county shall require the owner of the property where this debris was generated, if its source can be identified, to clear and remove the debris so as to permit the free flow of water. 
                  (n)  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. 
                  (o)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharges from the system into floodwaters.

                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 12-1. - Radioactive fallout protection in county buildings. 
                  (a)  Every officer, board, department, commission or agency of the county charged with the duty of preparing specifications, or awarding or entering into contracts for the design, erection or construction of buildings, or other structures, including additions to existing structures, for the county shall incorporate, or cause to be incorporated, in such buildings, or other structures, protection from radioactive fallout, for at least its normal anticipated occupancy, which shall meet, or exceed, the minimum space and protection criteria recommended by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, unless exempted from such shelter requirements in accordance with this chapter. 
                  (b)  The board of commissioners may exempt buildings or other structures from the requirements of this section where it finds that the addition of fallout protection will create, in the building or other structure, an additional net cost in excess of the funds available in the construction of such building, or that other factors make it unnecessary or impracticable to incorporate fallout protection in the design or construction of such building or structure. 
                  (c)  It shall be the policy of the board of commissioners that fallout shelter protection shall be incorporated into all county buildings or structures to the fullest extent practicable in order to provide protection against the effects of radioactive fallout for the greatest possible number of people in the event of nuclear attack upon the United States, or an accidental nuclear explosion.

                  (Code 1987, § 6-21; Ord. No. 2011-001, § 1, 10-4-2011) 
                  Sec. 12-22. - Emergency management and response powers. 
                  (a)  Declaration of local emergency. 
                  (1)  Grant of authority. In the event of an actual or threatened occurrence of a disaster or emergency, which may result in the large-scale loss of life, injury, property damage or destruction or in the major disruption of routine community affairs, business or governmental operations in the county and which is of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant extraordinary assistance by federal, state and local departments and agencies to supplement the efforts of available public and private resources, the board of commissioners may declare a local emergency for the county. The form of the declaration shall be similar to that provided in subsection (b) of this section. 
                  (2)  Request for state assistance. Consistent with a declaration of a local emergency, the chairperson may request the governor to provide assistance, provided that the disaster or emergency is beyond the capacity of the county to meet adequately and state assistance is necessary to supplement local efforts to save lives and protect property, public health and safety, or to avert or lessen the threat of a disaster. 
                  (3)  Continuance. The declaration of local emergency shall continue until the chairperson finds that emergency conditions no longer exist, at which time the chairperson shall execute and file with the county administrator a document marking the end of the state of emergency. No state of local emergency shall continue for longer than 30 days, unless renewed by the chairperson. The board of commissioners may, by resolution, end a state of local emergency at any time. 
                  (4)  Effect of declaration of emergency. 
                  a.  Activation of emergency operations plan. A declaration of emergency by the governor or a declaration of local emergency by the chairperson shall automatically activate the county emergency operations plan and shall be the authority for the deployment of personnel and use of any forces to which the plan applies and for use or distribution of any supplies, equipment, materials, and facilities assembled, stockpiled or arranged to be made available pursuant to the Georgia Emergency Management Act or any other laws applicable to emergencies or disasters. 
                  1.  The Liberty County Emergency Management Agency (LCEMA) director shall have the legal authority to exercise the powers and discharge the duties conferred upon the emergency management agency, including implementation of the emergency operations plan, coordination of the emergency response of public and private agencies and organizations, coordination of recovery efforts with state and federal officials, and inspection of emergency or disaster sites. 
                  2.  In responding and conducting necessary and appropriate investigations the director or his designee is authorized to enter at a reasonable time upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigating and inspecting sites involved with emergency management functions. The director is authorized to execute a right of entry and/or agreement to use property for these purposes on behalf of the county; however, any such document shall be later presented for ratification at a meeting of the board of commissioners. 
                  3.  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the county who requests entry for purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials. Nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while that individual is in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  b.  Emergency powers. Following a declaration of emergency and during the continuance of such state of emergency, the chairperson is authorized to implement local emergency measures to protect life and property or to bring the emergency situation under control. In exercising this authority, the chairperson may cause to become effective any of the following sections of this chapter as appropriate: section 12-25 (registration of building and repair services) to become effective if the governor declares a state of emergency; and section 12-26 (closed or restricted areas and curfews during emergency). If any of these sections is included in a declaration of local emergency, the same shall be filed in the office of the county administrator and shall be in effect until the declaration of local emergency has terminated. 
                  c.  Authority to waive procedures and fees. Pursuant to declaration of emergency, the board of commissioners is authorized to cause to be effective any of the subsections of section 12-24 as appropriate. The implementation of such sections shall be filed in the office of the county administrator. 
                  d.  Additional emergency powers. The chairperson of the board of commissioners shall have, and may exercise for such period as the declared emergency exists or continues, the following additional emergency powers: 
                  1.  To direct and compel the evacuation of all or part of the population from any stricken or threatened area, for the preservation of life or other disaster mitigation, response or recovery; 
                  2.  To prescribe routes, modes of transportation, and destinations in connection with evacuation; 
                  3.  To suspend or limit the sale, dispensing or transportation of alcoholic beverages, firearms, explosives and flammable liquids and substances; 
                  4.  To make provision for the availability and use of temporary emergency housing, emergency shelters and/or emergency medical shelters; 
                  5.  To transfer the direction, personnel or functions of any county departments and agencies or units thereof for the purpose of performing or facilitating emergency services; 
                  6.  To utilize all available resources of the county and subordinate agencies over which the county has budgetary control as reasonably necessary to cope with the emergency or disaster; 
                  7.  To commandeer or utilize public or private property when necessary to cope with the emergency or disaster or when there is compelling necessity for the protection of lives, health and welfare; and/or the property of citizens; 
                  8.  To suspend any law, code provision or regulation prescribing the procedures for conduct of county business, or the orders, rules or regulations of any county agency, if strict compliance with any ordinance, resolution, order, rule or regulation would in any way prevent, hinder or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency or disaster, provided that such suspension shall provide for the minimum deviation from the requirements under the circumstances and further provided that, when practicable, specialists shall be assigned to avoid adverse effects resulting from such suspension; 
                  9.  To provide benefits to citizens upon execution of an intergovernmental agreement for grants to meet disaster-related necessary expenses or serious needs of individuals or families adversely affected by an emergency or disaster in cases where the individuals or families are unable to meet the expenses or needs from other means, provided that such grants are authorized only when matching state or federal funds are available for such purposes; and 
                  10.  To perform and exercise such other functions, powers and duties as may be deemed necessary to promote and secure the safety and protection of the civilian population, including individuals with household pets and service animals prior to, during, and following a major disaster or emergency.

When such meetings occur outside of the county, all actions taken by the board of commissioners shall be as valid and binding as if performed within the county. Such meetings may be called by the presiding officer or any two members of the governing body without regard to or compliance with time-consuming procedures and formalities otherwise required by law. 
                  (2)  Local legislation should be reviewed to determine whether there are restrictions upon moving the meeting location if it is only a locally declared emergency and not a state of emergency declared by the governor. 
                  (b)  Public works contracts. Upon declaration of an emergency or disaster by the governor or chairperson of the board of commissioners, the county may contract for public works without letting such contract out to the lowest, responsible bidder and without advertising and posting notification of such contract for four weeks; provided, however, that the emergency must be of such nature that immediate action is required and that the action is necessary for the protection of the public's health, safety and welfare. Any public works contract entered into pursuant to this subsection shall be entered on the minutes of the city as soon as practical and the nature of the emergency described therein in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 36-91-22(e). 
                  (c)  Purchasing.

                  (d)  Code enforcement. Upon declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor or the chairperson of the board of commissioners, the board of commissioners may temporarily suspend the enforcement of the ordinances of the city, or any portion thereof, where the emergency is of such nature that immediate action outside the code is required, such suspension is consistent with the protection of the public health, safety and welfare, and such suspension is not inconsistent with any federal or state statutes or regulations. 
                  (e)  Fees. Upon declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor or the chairperson of the board of commissioners, the board of commissioners or designees may temporarily reduce or suspend any permit fees, application fees or other rate structures as necessary to encourage the rebuilding of the areas impacted by the disaster or emergency. The term "fees" includes fees or rates charged by the county for building permits, land disturbance permits, zoning applications, special land use permits, temporary land use permits and other fees relating to the reconstruction, repair and cleanup of areas impacted by the disaster or emergency. The term "fees" does not include fees collected by the county on behalf of the state or federal government or fees charged by the county pursuant to a state or federal statute or regulation. 
                  (f)  Temporary dwellings. Upon the declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor or chairperson of the board of commissioners, the board of commissioners or its designees may issue temporary mobile home, trailer, recreational vehicle or other temporary dwelling structures or parks in any zoning district, even though not otherwise permitted by the development code, while the primary dwelling is being repaired.

Each day any such entity does business in the county without complying with this section constitutes a separate offense. 
                  (b)  The cost of registration fees in a declared emergency shall be determined by the chairperson of the board of commissioners. Registration is nontransferable. The cost of the emergency building permit shall be equal to the cost for a building permit under existing regulations. The permit shall only be authorized for repairs. 
                  (c)  When registering, any person, partnership, corporation or other entity making application must, under oath, complete an application, providing the following information:

                  Sec. 18-1. - Title. 
                  This chapter will be known as the "Liberty County Groundwater Recharge Area Protection Ordinance." 
                  (Code 1987, § 8.5-1; Ord. No. 1999-003, 11-2-1999) 
                  Sec. 18-2. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Aquifer means any stratum or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well. 
                  Drastic means the standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency document EPA-600/2-87-035. (Note: the "Drastic" methodology is the most widely used technique for evaluation of pollution susceptibility.) 
                  Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharges, leaks, impoundment's, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area. Recharge areas are determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium, or low based on the Hydrologic Atlas 20, Groundwater Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia, prepared by the department of natural resources. 
                  Pollution susceptibility maps means maps of relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the department of natural resources, using the drastic methodology. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land area of the state into areas having high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential. 
                  Recharge area means any portion of the earth's surface, where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer. 
                  Significant recharge areas means those areas mapped by the department of natural resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology, soil type and thickness, slope, density or lithologic contacts, geologic structure, the presence of karst, and potentiometric surfaces. 
                  (Code 1987, § 8.5-2; Ord. No. 1999-003, 11-2-1999)

                  Sec. 22-2. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  Discharges to the county separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters. 
                  (b)  These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the county separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments. 
                  (c)  The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters. 
                  (d)  These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the county separate storm sewer system. The regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the county separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.

                  Sec. 22-3. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare through the regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the county separate storm sewer system to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal law. This article establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the county separate storm sewer system in order to comply with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process. The objectives of this article are to:

                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial or other fuse. The use or occupation of this building for human habitation or for commercial, industrial or other use is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (b)  The placard shall bear the date posted, street number of the building involved, and the signature of the public officer.

                  Sec. 26-96. - Collection of amount due on lien. 
                  The county shall enforce the collection of any amount due on a lien arising under this article in the following manner: 
                  (1)  Amount. The amount of the lien shall be established as follows: There shall be an administrative fee assessed against all liened properties together with the costs of serving all notices required by this article. The amount of the lien shall also include the cost of vacating, removal, closing, repairing, or demolition which shall be the cost paid or incurred by the county in effecting action against any property. The administrative fee shall be in an amount as established by the board of commissioners from time to time. 
                  (2)  Notice of lien. The owner and/or parties in interest, if they possess a recorded interest in the property, shall be served with a copy of the lien and shall be allowed to satisfy the amount due on such lien by paying to the county, within 30 days after the perfection of such lien, a sum of money not less than 25 percent of the total due on such lien, and by further paying the remaining balance due, together with interest at the rate of seven percent per annum. In three equal annual payments, each of which shall become due and payable on the anniversary date of the initial payment made as prescribed in this section. 
                  (3)  Transfer of property. Should such property be sold, transferred or conveyed by the owner and/or parties in interest at any time prior to the termination of the three-year payment period, the entire balance due on such lien, with earned interest, shall be due and payable to the county. 
                  (4)  Nonsatisfaction. Should the amount due on the lien, or any portion thereof, be unpaid after it is due, the county may enforce the collection of any amount due on such lien in the same manner as provided in O.C.G.A. § 48-5-358 and other applicable statutes. This procedure shall be subject to the right of redemption by any person having any right, title or interest in or lien upon the property, all as provided by O.C.G.A. § 48-4-40.

                  (1)  Costs. The costs of service pursuant to this section shall be included in the sums otherwise due under this article. 
                  (2)  Service. Such person as designated by the county who is of legal age may be authorized to perform the service of all documents pursuant to this article in the manner usually performed by sheriffs, provided they follow the procedures established by statute for those officials, and a fee may be assessed against the property so long as it does not exceed the fee currently imposed by the sheriff of the county for that activity. Any notice pursuant to section 26-88, any order issued pursuant to section 26-90, or any other post-hearing action effecting the property may be served upon the owner and parties in interest by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address specified in O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12, as applicable, and to the address of the property if it is occupied on the date of inspection, care or "occupant." If any party has specified to the public officer prior to or at the hearing an address for notice, that address shall be used for notices.

                  (a)  All persons, including individuals, associations, corporations, partnerships, joint ventures, or other entities of whatever nature or description, engaged in business in the unincorporated area of the county are hereby required to register their business or office and obtain a business license therefor, and pay the amount now or hereafter fixed as the occupation tax thereon. 
                  (b)  Even though a person may be exempt under state or other law from paying an occupation tax, nevertheless, such person must apply for and obtain a business license to engage in or carry on any business within the unincorporated areas of the county and submit proper and lawful credentials exempting such person from paying the occupation tax. 
                  (c)  All applications for a business license shall be made to the business license officer as designated by the county administrator from time to time. The application, license forms and other documents and papers necessary to the implementation and enforcement of this article shall be on such forms as may be prepared by the business license officer and approved by the county administrator.

                  Sec. 28-2. - Separate business license required. 
                  (a)  Each business license issued pursuant to this article shall authorize the conduct of one place of business only, at the business location or office, and persons engaging in business in more than one location or office within the unincorporated portions of the county shall obtain a separate certificate for each location, paying a separate fee for each such certificate. 
                  (b)  If the location or office has several separate structures which are used as part of one general business operation of the user (in this section "user" shall not include landlord or lessor) of the structures, then for the purposes of the requirements to obtain a business license, such business operation shall be deemed to have but one location. 
                  (c)  A separate business license shall be required for each separate and distinct business operation located within the same structure.

                  Sec. 28-3. - Procedure for issuance. 
                  (a)  Within ten business days from receipt of a fully completed application submitted in accordance with this article, the business license officer shall either approve or deny the application; provided, however, that the following applications shall be forwarded to the governing authority for action: 
                  (1)  Establishments selling wine, spirits, or other alcoholic beverages; 
                  (2)  Business operations which could later result in a nuisance or otherwise potentially jeopardize the public health, peace, welfare, or safety, as determined by the business license officer; or 
                  (3)  Businesses for which the governing authority's approval is required under the ordinances of the county. 
                  Upon review, the governing authority may elect to approve, deny, or approve the application subject to such reasonable conditions as the governing authority deems appropriate. 
                  (b)  All regulatory fees required in connection with any approved business licenses must be paid in full to the business license officer within 30 days following approval. If such regulatory fees are not paid by the licensee within the aforementioned thirty-day period, the license will be declared null and void, requiring that a new application be submitted for consideration. 
                  (c)  All licensees wishing to renew their business license from the previous year shall make application for such license on or before January 31 on such forms as may be prepared by the business license officer and approved by the county administrator. Notwithstanding any terminology used in this article or any other provision herein to the contrary, the granting of a license for one year shall in no way vest any rights or privileges whatsoever to a licensee to any renewal or subsequent license, and such person must satisfy in full the requirements for such business license established by ordinance at the time of such renewal.

                  Sec. 28-5. - Denial, suspension and revocation of license. 
                  (a)  A business license or an application for a business license under this article may be denied, suspended or revoked only for due cause as defined in subsection (c) of this section. A business license may be denied or suspended by the business license officer as set forth in this article; provided, however, that a business license may be revoked only after a hearing before the governing authority of the county upon a prior written notice to the applicant or licensee of the time, place and purpose of such hearing and a statement of the reason why the license is to be revoked. Three days' notice shall be deemed reasonable, but shorter or longer periods of notice shall be authorized as the board of commissioners may deem the circumstances justify. Unless the circumstances otherwise justify, the hearing shall be generally held no later than 45 days after the fully completed application is filed with the business license officer, or after the officer has suspended a business license. If a business license is denied by the business license officer under this article, the reasons for such denial shall be set forth in writing to the applicant. The applicant shall have 30 days following receipt of notice of denial to appeal the decision of the business license officer to the governing authority, which shall review such application de novo at the next regular meeting of the governing authority following receipt of any such appeal, or, at the election of said governing authority, at a special meeting within 45 days following said appeal; provided, however, that any appeal received within ten business days prior to the next regular meeting of the governing authority shall be heard at the second regularly scheduled meeting of said governing authority following receipt of said appeal. If the governing authority affirms the decision of the business license officer, then the license shall be denied. If the decision of the business license officer is reversed, then the license shall be issued to the applicant. Alternatively, the governing authority may elect to issue the license subject to such reasonable conditions as the governing authority deems appropriate. 
                  (b)  The business license officer may suspend a business license where there is evidence of due cause under subsection (c) of this section for revoking the license. Such action by the business license officer shall be reported, in writing, to the governing authority. This action shall be reviewed at the next regular meeting of the governing authority, or, at the election of said governing authority, at a special meeting within 30 days following said suspension. If the governing authority affirms the decision of the business license officer, then the license shall be permanently revoked. If the decision of the business license officer is reversed, then the license shall be returned to the licensee immediately. Alternatively, the governing authority may elect to return the license to the licensee subject to such reasonable conditions as the governing authority deems appropriate. 
                  (c)  A business license or application therefor under this article may be denied, suspended or revoked only if one or more of the following exists: 
                  (1)  The applicant or licensee has failed to obtain any paper, approval, or document necessary in pursuance of its business as may be required by any office, agency or department of the county, state or United States under authority of any law, ordinance or resolution of the county, state or United States. 
                  (2)  The applicant or licensee has supplied false information to the business license officer or the governing authority. 
                  (3)  The applicant or licensee has violated any federal or state law involving moral turpitude, any state or federal gambling law or local ordinance or any ordinance or resolution regulating such business, or has violated any regulation made pursuant to authority granted for the purpose of regulating such business. 
                  (4)  The applicant or licensee has failed to pay any fee required under this article, has failed to make a return or pay a tax due to the tax commissioner of the county in connection with its business or any predecessor business (to include, without limitation, occupational tax or real or personal property ad valorem tax), or has otherwise failed to comply with the provisions of this article; provided, however, that a business license may not be denied, suspended or revoked under this article with respect to ad valorem taxes (whether real or personal property): 
                  a.  Due in the current calendar year; 
                  b.  Presently the subject of lawful appeal; or 
                  c.  Not collectible by virtue of duly enacted statute, ordinance, or other law. 
                  For purposes of this subsection (c)(4), a predecessor business (whether a sole proprietorship, corporation, partnership, or other entity) shall be a business engaged in substantially the same or related business as the applicant and from whom the applicant acquired title to or possession of a substantial portion of its business property, either directly or indirectly, whether real or personal, and for which taxes are outstanding. 
                  (5)  The applicant or licensee during the 12 months next preceding has engaged in misrepresentation of facts, whether through advertisement or through any form of direct communication, oral or written, which is intended to mislead the public or any party with whom the licensee deals in pursuance of the licensed business. By way of illustration only, and without limiting the scope of this subsection, the term "due cause" as used in this section shall consist of any act or practice designated as unlawful in O.C.G.A. § 10-1-393(b) or declared by the administrator of the Fair Business Practices Act to be unlawful pursuant to regulations made under O.C.G.A. § 10-1-394, subject to the exemptions contained in O.C.G.A. § 10-1-396. 
                  (6)  Allowing any condition on the licensed premises or in the business operations that endangers public health or safety.

                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 30-1. - Grievance procedure for handicapped persons. 
                  (a)  The board of commissioners hereby adopts an internal grievance procedure providing for the resolution of complaints alleging any action prohibited by the office of revenue sharing's regulations implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. Section 504 states, in part, that "no otherwise qualified handicapped individual shall, solely by reason of such person's handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving financial assistance …. " 
                  (b)  Complaints should be addressed to the county. 
                  (1)  A complaint shall be filed in writing or verbally, contain the name and address of the person filing it, and briefly describe the alleged violation of the regulations.

                  (3)  An investigation, if appropriate, shall follow a filing of a complaint. The investigation will be conducted by the handicap coordinator or such coordinator's designated appointee. These rules contemplate informal, but thorough, investigations, affording all interested persons and their representatives, if any, an opportunity to submit evidence relevant to a complaint. Under federal law, the board of commissioners need not process complaints from applicants for employment or from applicants for admission to postsecondary educational institutions. 
                  (4)  A written determination as to the validity of the complaint and description of resolution, if any, shall be issued by the handicap coordinator and a copy forwarded to the complainant not later than 30 days after its filing. 
                  (5)  The handicap coordinator shall maintain the files and records of the board of commissioners relating to the complaints filed. 
                  (6)  The right of a person to a prompt and equitable resolution of the complaint filed hereunder shall not be impaired by the person's pursuit of other remedies such as filing of a section 504 complaint with the office of Revenue Sharing, U.S. Department of Treasury. Utilization of this grievance procedure is not a prerequisite to the pursuit of other remedies. 
                  (7)  The complainant can request a reconsideration of the case in instances where such complainant is dissatisfied with the resolution. The request for reconsideration should be made within ten days to the county administrator. 
                  (8)  These rules shall be construed to protect the substantive rights of interested persons, to meet appropriate due process standards and to assure that the board of commissioners complies with section 504 and the office of revenue sharing regulations.

                  Sec. 30-6. - Smoking and use of tobacco-related products prohibited in county-owned or operated indoor facilities, parks and vehicles. 
                  (a)  Public purpose. Based upon the reports of the U.S. Surgeon General and other reliable and credible scientific bodies indicating that the smoking of cigarettes, cigars, pipes and similar products, together with the secondary smoke generated thereby, is a contributing cause of illness among both smokers and passive smokers (those inhaling the smoke of other), to include, without limitation, cancer, heart disease and lung disorders; it is the finding of the board of commissioners of the county, that the smoke produced by the smoking of cigarettes, cigars, pipes and similar products is both hazardous and detrimental to the health, safety, well-being and comfort of the nonsmoking public. The Board of Commissioners of Liberty County, Georgia, therefore, finds that it is in the interest of public health, safety, and the general welfare of the employees, residents and visitors of the county to prohibit in county-owned or county-operated indoor facilities, parks and vehicles the inhaling, exhaling, burning, use, or carrying of any lighted or heated cigar, cigarette, or pipe, or any other lighted or heated tobacco product intended for inhalation, in any manner or in any form.

                  Smoking means the inhaling, exhaling, burning or carrying any lighted or heated cigar, cigarette, or pipe, or any other lighted or heated tobacco product intended for inhalation, in any manner or in any form.

                  (f)  Enforcement. The magistrate court of the county shall have jurisdiction over violations of this section and all procedures for enforcement hereof shall be as provided in O.C.G.A. Title 15, Chapter 10, Article 4 (O.C.G.A. § 15-10-60 et seq.), as amended.

                  ARTICLE II. - REDUCTION OF FALSE ALARMS 

                  Sec. 30-31. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this article is to encourage alarm owners to properly use and maintain the operational effectiveness of alarm systems in order to improve their reliability and reduce or eliminate false alarms. The governing authority of the county finds that excessive false alarms unduly burden the county sheriff's department and other fire rescue responders and impairs limited public safety resources.

                  False alarm administrator means the person designated by the county administrator to administer this article. 
                  Public safety personnel means the county sheriff's department or other fire rescue responders funded, in whole or in part, by the board of commissioners.

                  Sec. 30-33. - Fee established; notification of false alarm. 
                  (a)  Fee established. To discourage excessive false alarms at any residential, commercial, industrial, institutional, educational or other location and better protect the lives and property of the citizens and residents of the county, as well as to reduce unnecessary use of public safety resources and help to defray the costs of responding to false alarms, a false alarm service fee is hereby established. 
                  (b)  Rate. The owner or lessee of any residential, commercial, industrial, institutional, educational or other property with an alarm system shall pay to the board of commissioners a false alarm service fee for each false alarm responded to by public safety personnel, based upon the total number of false alarms occurring at such location during the preceding 12 months.

                  All false alarm service fees assessed by this section shall be due and payable within 30 days following notice thereof.

Such notice may be given by mailing a copy of the notice of false alarm prescribed by this section to the alarmed premises, or by leaving a copy of such notice of false alarm at the alarmed premises. 
                  (d)  Exceptions. Each of the following circumstances shall not constitute a false alarm and no fee shall be assessed hereunder: 
                  (1)  Alarm conditions activated by a person working on the alarm system with prior notification to the county sheriff's department; or

                  (b)  Appeals. Any owner or lessee of an alarmed premises may appeal the determination of a false alarm and/or the assessment of a false alarm service fee under this article to the false alarm review board.

                  (Code 1987, § 14-3; Ord. No. 2004-005, § I, 12-7-2004; Ord. No. 2009-003, § I, 7-7-2009) 
                  Sec. 32-23. - Creation of governing board; chairperson; powers; meetings. 
                  (a)  There is hereby created and established the Liberty Consolidated Planning Commission Governing Board, hereinafter referred to as the "governing board," which is vested with the authority to and responsibility for appointing the members of the Liberty Consolidated Planning Commission, approving the budget of the consolidated planning commission, and for supervising certain personnel matters relating to the said consolidated planning commission. 
                  (1)  The governing board shall consist of the following persons or their designees: 
                  a.  The chairperson of the Liberty County Board of Commissioners; 
                  b.  The mayor of the City of Hinesville; 
                  c.  The mayor of the City of Allenhurst; 
                  d.  The mayor of the City of Midway; 
                  e.  The mayor of the City of Gum Branch; 
                  f.  The mayor of the City of Walthourville; 
                  g.  The mayor of the City of Riceboro; and 
                  h.  The mayor of the City of Flemington. 
                  (2)  The chairperson and the vice-chairperson of the commission shall be ex officio members of the governing board and shall be permitted to deliberate on all actions of the governing board (excluding his or her appointment), but shall not be a voting member of the governing board and shall not be counted to establish the quorum required to take action. The governing board shall elect from its members a chairperson and a vice-chairperson, each to serve for a term of one calendar year and until a successor is elected, and who shall be eligible for reelection to such office. The executive director of the consolidated planning commission (or other person designated by the governing board) shall serve as secretary of the governing board, and shall perform such duties in connection with said office as may be designated by the governing board from time to time. The governing board shall meet biannually at the call of the chairperson of the governing board, and at such other times as the chairperson of the governing board or a majority of governing board members shall determine. 
                  (b)  Subject to the protections of sovereign and official immunity (and other doctrines and laws of the state), the commission shall be solely liable and responsible for its actions and those of the personnel retained to discharge its obligations and services under this article. In this connection, the commission shall employ an executive director and such other employees as the executive director may recommend and be approved by the governing board. More specifically, the executive director shall have the responsibility of retaining, disciplining, evaluating, discharging, and otherwise managing the personnel of the commission; provided that all such decisions shall be reviewable by the governing board as provided in any subsequently enacted personnel policies that may be established by the executive director and approved by the governing board. Notwithstanding that the executive director shall be deemed employed by the commission, he shall be retained, disciplined, evaluated, discharged and otherwise supervised by the governing board. In particular, and not by way of limitation, any personnel action pertaining to the executive director shall require a majority vote of the entire governing board, as well as the affirmative vote of each representative of a member jurisdiction having a funding obligation of 20 percent or more (as determined pursuant to paragraph 4 of the intergovernmental agreement). For purposes of this article and all other circumstances, the governing board shall be deemed a component and part of the consolidated planning commission (but not subject to its control), and shall have supervisory powers over its personnel as generally set forth in this article. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the governing board shall have no involvement in or influence over the recommendations made or other functions performed by the commission unless specifically authorized herein; provided that all decisions regarding the personnel of the commission shall be determined and managed by the governing board and the executive director as generally set forth in this section or as provided in any subsequently enacted personnel policies that may be established by the executive director and approved by the governing board. 
                  (c)  To assist the governing board in budget and personnel decisions, a standing executive committee of the governing board shall be established that consists of the representative of each member jurisdiction having a funding obligation of 20 percent or more (as determined pursuant to paragraph 4 of the intergovernmental agreement), one representative of a member jurisdiction having a funding obligation of less than 20 percent (as determined pursuant to paragraph 4 of the intergovernmental agreement), the chairperson of the consolidated planning commission, and the vice-chairperson of the consolidated planning commission. The chairperson and the vice-chairperson of the commission shall be ex officio members of the executive committee and shall be permitted to deliberate on all actions of the governing board (excluding any appointments or personnel actions relating to the executive director), but shall not be a voting member of the executive committee and shall not be counted to establish the quorum required to take action. The governing board shall elect from the members of the executive committee a chairperson and a vice-chairperson of the executive committee, each to serve for a term of one calendar year and until a successor is elected, and who shall be eligible for reelection to such office. The executive director of the consolidated planning commission (or other person designated by the governing board) shall serve as secretary of the executive committee, and shall perform such duties in connection with said office as may be designated by the executive committee from time to time. The executive committee shall meet at the call of the chairperson of the executive committee, and at such other times as the chairperson of the executive committee or a majority of members shall determine. 
                  (d)  This executive committee shall review all budgets proposed by the executive director and make recommendations to the governing board, who shall approve the final budget and any modifications. The executive committee shall evaluate the performance of the executive director, screen candidates for the executive director when the position is vacant, and recommend any personnel actions relating to the executive director to the governing board for approval. In particular, and not by way of limitation, any personnel action recommended by the committee pertaining to the executive director, or any other personnel, shall require a majority vote of the entire executive committee, as well as the affirmative vote of each representative of a member jurisdiction having a funding obligation of 20 percent or more (as determined pursuant to paragraph 4 of the intergovernmental agreement). 
                  (Code 1987, § 14-4; Ord. No. 2004-005, § I, 12-7-2004; Ord. No. 2009-003, § I, 7-7-2009) 
                  Sec. 32-24. - Commission membership. 
                  The commission shall consist of nine members who shall be residents of the county and who shall be appointed by the governing board as provided in this article. The governing board shall appoint no more than four residents of any one municipality within the county, and no more than four residents of the unincorporated areas of the county, to serve as members of the commission. No member of the commission shall be an employee or elected official of any participating local government. All members shall serve until their successors are appointed. 
                  (1)  Member professional backgrounds. At all times, the governing board shall endeavor to appoint to the commission at least one member who has a professional background in the field of real estate development, at least one member who has a professional background in the field of building and construction, at least one member who has a professional background in business management, at least one member who has a professional background in general industry or industrial management, at least one member who has a professional background in the field of natural resources or environmental protection; provided that the governing board is not strictly obligated to appoint members from the aforementioned fields, but shall in all instances appoint members it determines to be the most qualified and appropriate, taking into consideration the desirability of having members from the various fields enumerated in this subsection. The governing board, in its sole discretion, shall determine what the professional background of any member is and whether a member satisfies any requirements set forth in this subsection. 
                  (2)  Original appointments; current appointments. Original appointments to the commission shall be made by the governing board or its predecessor on or before December 20, 2004, and shall initially include three members who shall serve for a term of one year; three members who shall serve for a term of two years; and three members who shall serve for a term of three years. All regular appointments thereafter shall be for a term of three years; provided that any member may be appointed to successive terms. Those members of the commission appointed by the governing board and serving as of the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall continue for the term of their office and until their successors are appointed. 
                  (3)  Quorum; voting. With respect to both the governing board and the commission, an affirmative vote of a majority of the members of each such body, entitled to vote, and present shall be sufficient to permit the conduct of all business; provided, however, that in the event such affirmative majority vote of the membership of such body is made impossible due to either: 
                  a.  Temporary vacancy on the board; or 
                  b.  Refusal of any member due to a conflict of interest as determined by such member. 
                  An affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining members of such body not otherwise unable to participate as set forth in subsections (3)a. and (3)b. of this section shall be sufficient to permit the conduct of all business. 
                  (4)  Vacancies. Any vacancy in the membership of the commission arising at any time and from any cause, including, without limitation, the authorization of an increase in the number of members, or the death, resignation, incapacity, or removal of any incumbent member shall be filled for the unexpired term by the governing board. 
                  (5)  Removal. The governing board may remove any member of the commission for due cause after written notice and a public hearing. Without limiting the foregoing, the governing board may consider for removal any member of the commission who is absent from three consecutive regular meetings of the commission or more than one-third of the commission's meetings, regular or special, that occur within a calendar year. The governing board may elect not to remove a member on the grounds of excessive absence if that member demonstrates that their absence was for good cause as determined by the governing board or if such absence is otherwise excused by the laws of the state. The findings and determinations of the governing board with respect to such matters shall be conclusive and absolute.

However, the commission shall not be delegated any legislative authority such as the final approval of zoning map amendments or conditional or special uses. 
                  (5)  Review and approve subdivision plats; provided, however, that if the commission is given authority to grant approval of final plats, said approval shall not constitute acceptance of public improvements which is a power reserved by the participating local governments. 
                  (6)  Prepare and recommend for adoption to any participating local government, a plat or plats, or a corridor map or maps, showing the location of the boundary lines of existing, proposed, extended, widened or narrowed streets and linear open spaces and recreational areas, together with regulations to control the erection of buildings or other structures within such lines, within the local jurisdiction or a specified portion thereof. 
                  (7)  Make, publish, and distribute maps, plans and reports and recommendations relating to the planning and development of any local jurisdiction to public officials and agencies, public utility companies, civic, educational, professional, and other organizations and citizens.

                  (b)  The authorization to undertake these functions shall not be considered a mandate for the commission to perform all of these functions, nor shall it prohibit the discretion of any participating local government, by law or resolution, from assigning one or more of these functions to a staff member of that government, or to another agency or commission. The powers and duties enumerated above shall be liberally construed to effectuate the intent and purpose of this article and the commission.

                  (b)  Individual single-family, private residential properties will be billed as part of their annual property tax bill for the annual solid waste assessment. The annual solid waste assessment is not a tax, it is an assessment. As such the assessment is not based upon the taxable value of the residence but is an annual fee imposed equally on each specified property within the specific tax district. 
                  (c)  The solid waste assessment for camper lots will be billed annually based on occupancy of the lot as of January of the calendar year for which the solid waste assessment covers, regardless of tax district.

The tax commissioner will maintain a solid waste assessment billing register. Sixty days after the due date for the solid waste assessment, the tax commissioner will send a delinquency notice to each residential property owner who has not paid their correct solid waste billing. This notice will advise payment is due within 30 days or the delinquent account will be sent to the magistrate court for collection.

                  (1)  Commercial dwelling properties. Specifically excluded from this residential solid waste assessment are rental properties such as apartments, townhouses and mobile home or trailer parks. These residential properties are considered commercial enterprises and must provide full solid waste services for the individual residents of these complexes as detailed elsewhere in these ordinances. Residents of these rental properties are prohibited for using rural residential waste disposal facilities or commercial/business waste disposal containers provided by businesses other than containers provided by the owner of the rental property specified in this section. Fines for violation of this provision of the ordinance are detailed in section 34-70.

                  ARTICLE IV. - REGULATIONS FOR USE OF SERVICES AND FACILITIES 

                  Sec. 34-101. - General use of facilities. 
                  Liberty County has established solid waste management services and facilities for authorized use by the residents, municipalities, and commercial and business establishments located in the jurisdictional boundaries of the county. This article details the authorized use of these specific facilities, sets forth user fees for specific facilities and establishes penalties for unauthorized use of said facilities. 
                  (Code 1987, § 15-201; Ord. No. 2006-001, 2-1-2006) 
                  Sec. 34-102. - Facilities description, service fees and authorized users. 
                  (a)  Transfer station. This facility accepts conforming nonhazardous solid waste from collection sources such as jurisdictional municipal solid waste collection services (public and privately owned), county-operated solid waste collection services (rural and commercial clients), jurisdictional commercial and business (contract and cash) customers and nonjurisdictional private residential and nonjurisdictional commercial and business clients. All solid waste processed into the transfer station is charged a published disposal fee based on the customer and the solid waste material. Disposal fees are established by the county board of commissioners (see section 34-71) and are periodically adjusted. The current fee schedule is available through the county solid waste authority, at the transfer station. 
                  (b)  Convenience centers. These facilities, located throughout the unincorporated area of the county, provide interim solid waste disposal/collection points for the unincorporated residents and municipal residents of Allenhurst, Flemington, Gumbranch, Midway, Riceboro and Walthourville. (This excludes Hinesville residents who have full range solid waste collection provided by the city and thus are not assessed for associated operational/disposal costs.) These convenience centers are for use by single-family residential property owners of the unincorporated area and municipalities described above. Operational costs for these facilities are recouped through the county solid waste assessment. Use by unauthorized commercial and business or nonjurisdictional parties is prohibited. Typically, each center includes one household waste compactor with a 38- to 40-cubic-yard enclosed receiving container and two 40-cubic-yard open top containers for disposal of yard waste, scrap metal and appliances (white goods) and bulky waste (brown goods). Additionally, each center provides facilities for acceptance of recyclable items. Service fees (annual residential solid waste assessment) for authorized customers are established by the county board of commissioners (see section 34-71) and are periodically adjusted. A listing of these fees is available, through the county solid waste authority, at the commissioner's office or at the county solid waste authority transfer station. 
                  (c)  Rural dumpster sites. The county operates several rural dumpster sites in the unincorporated area of the county. Until these sites are closed, their use is restricted to those jurisdictional residents who pay for their operation through the annual residential solid waste assessment. Use by non-jurisdictional parties and/or commercial or business enterprises is strictly prohibited. 
                  (d)  Recycling facilities. Six additional recycling facilities are located in the municipal boundaries of Hinesville (four locations), Walthourville (one facility) and Riceboro (one facility). These facilities, in addition to those co-located at each convenience center, are operated by the county solid waste authority for the sole use of county residents. No business or commercial use is authorized. The disposal of any type of nonconforming waste is unauthorized at these facilities. Recyclable items are to be placed in the appropriate bins or containers. Operational costs of these facilities are recouped through the annual residential solid waste assessment. 
                  (Code 1987, § 15-202; Ord. No. 2006-001, 2-1-2006) 
                  Sec. 34-103. - User fees. 
                  User fees have been established by the county board of commissioners for each of the facilities described above and are detailed in article II of this chapter. These fees are periodically adjusted by the board of commissioners. Current approved fee schedules are available at the commissioner's office or at the county solid waste authority transfer station. 
                  (Code 1987, § 15-202.1; Ord. No. 2006-001, 2-1-2006) 
                  Sec. 34-104. - Unauthorized use of convenience centers and recycling facilities. 
                  (a)  Generally. The cost to operate the county convenience centers, rural dumpster sites and recycling facilities is funded by the annual residential solid waste assessment. Use of these facilities is strictly reserved for residents of the county who pay for their operation through the annual assessment. Unauthorized users will be cited and include those who plan to use (are physically located at a site) or have used a facility to discard solid waste or recyclables and persons who are scavenging or have scavenged items from the solid waste collection containers or recycling facilities. Unauthorized users will be cited and will be subject to court fees, fines and disposal costs as determined by the county magistrate court, the table of offenses, fines and disposal charges (see section 34-105) and the county solid waste authority. 
                  (b)  Proof of authorization. The prima facie evidence of unauthorized use is the user's vehicle license plate. Out-of-county plates suggest the user is unauthorized. However, the out-of-county user is authorized to use the facility if they have received and paid the current annual residential solid waste assessment. A current paid receipt for the solid waste assessment supported by a second form of personal identification validates the authorized facility use by such residents. Officers of the county charged with validating solid waste facility users are to explain the reasons for verifying the user's residency; advise the out-of-county user to carry a copy of the paid solid waste assessment receipt; take the users name, home address and telephone number and license plate number and allow use of the facility. The name, address, license plate number and phone number will be transmitted to the litter control deputy for validation of authorized use. Fraudulent cases will be cited for unauthorized use through magistrate court. 
                  (c)  Identification. Unauthorized users will be identified as follows: 
                  (1)  Observation by the county litter control deputy or other solid waste authority employee. Observed use includes the physical act of waste disposal or being at a site with the intent to use the facility for waste disposal; or being on site to scavenge; being found in the act of scavenging; or found with scavenged material in their possession. 
                  (2)  Reporting of apparent unauthorized use by the general public under the silent witness program or by calling the offices of the county commission or the solid waste authority. In such cases, prima facie evidence is being on site using a vehicle with an out-of-county license plate or operation of a vehicle with affixed business logo operated by the potential offender who has or plans to dispose of waste typical of the business, and, if available, a description of the individual and the vehicle, the time and facility being used, and the type of waste being disposed of or scavenged. Additional evidence of unauthorized use is identifiable discards of solid waste (letters, bank receipts, credit card slips, magazines with address labels, shipping containers with ship-to addresses, business papers, etc.). Reports of this type will be accepted telephonically, in writing or verbally. 
                  (3)  Apprehension by an officer of the law. In this case, the apprehending officer will issue a citation to the offending party. No warnings will be given. 
                  (4)  After-the-fact clean-up of materials disposed of at any of the county facilities or materials discarded elsewhere in the county (private or publicly owned lands). In such cases, prima facie evidence will be any item recovered from the discards which bears a name, address or other form of personal identification which would indicate the last ownership of the improperly discarded items. 
                  (d)  Citation. Citations for unauthorized use of a county solid waste collection/disposal/recycling facility, unless issued by an officer of the law other than the county litter control deputy, will be written by the county litter control deputy and prosecuted through the county magistrate court. No warning will be issued since all facilities have been signed advising that unauthorized use is prohibited. 
                  (e)  Payment of fines and disposal charges. The county magistrate court will prosecute each case. The county solid waste authority will provide the court with calculated weight tickets detailing the associated pull fees, disposal charges and clean-up costs as appropriate for each citation. These costs are to be added to the fines presented in the tables of offenses, fines and disposal charges shown below. Upon payment to the court, the applicable fines and disposal charges will to turned over to the county solid waste authority through the office of the Clerk of the Superior Court.

The surety bond shall also indemnify the county for any costs incurred in the cleanup of waste or debris left on public property as a result of the timber harvesting. 
                  (c)  Upon completion of any necessary repairs to public property and removal of all waste and debris, the county will release the timber harvester from the surety bond. 
                  (d)  In no event shall the delivery of a surety bond limit the liability of any person engaged in timber harvesting and related activities for damages to public property or rights-of-way or for other personal injury or property damage. 
                  (e)  No more than one surety bond shall be required at any one time from a timber harvester hereunder regardless of the number of tracts harvested in the unincorporated areas of the county so long as said surety bond remains in effect; provided that a valid replacement surety bond must be obtained and delivered to the public works department no later than the close of business on the fifth business day following the day that the county files a claim to recover damages against the then-existing surety bond. Upon filing such claim, the public works department or other designee of the county shall immediately provide notice thereof, including the date such claim was filed, to the person causing the damage. Such notice may be given in person, by transmission of an electronic record via telefacsimile, or by e-mail. For purposes of this section, any such surety bond shall be valid only for the calendar year in which delivered.

                  (a)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to establish a fee mechanism whereby the users of the county water services are charged for those services in an amount established by the county as being necessary to properly maintain, repair, replace, operate, and expand, as the case may be, the water system in a sound, businesslike manner and to provide adequate financial support for the same. 
                  (b)  Customer classifications. Without limiting the right of the county to further define and establish customer classifications and categories, the following customer categories are established: 
                  (1)  Residential customer is the owner or occupant of an individual structure used primarily as a residence and assigned one water meter. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential customer is: 
                  a.  The owner or occupant of a structure with assigned water meter that is used for commercial or institutional purpose, not as residence; or

                  Sec. 38-33. - Miscellaneous charges. 
                  In addition to any other fees and charges authorized or implied by this chapter, the following fees and charges shall also be authorized in connection with the county water system: 
                  (1)  Delinquent billed accounts. All billed accounts are due and payable on the billing date. Billed accounts not paid within 30 days from the billing date are delinquent, and service may be disconnected by the county and a service charge added to the account. This delinquent service charge is applicable to each service call to discontinue service for delinquent accounts. The customer will be charged for the service call even if the service is not disconnected. 
                  (2)  Service calls. All customer service calls shall be charged to the customer requesting the service in accordance with a fee schedule established by the county reflecting as closely as possible the actual cost to the county for rendering the services. Restoration of service will only be made during normal working hours. 
                  (3)  Meter reinstallation due to nonpayment or failure to apply for service. A service charge to reinstall a meter shall be levied. 
                  (4)  Meter replacement, damage. The county shall determine charges to be assessed against any person causing damage to any part of the water system. Without limiting the foregoing, a charge (inclusive of the service call) will be made to replace a meter which has been damaged or frozen, or has in any way been made inoperative. The damaged meter must be returned to the county. 
                  (5)  Meter missing or stolen, replacement. A charge, based upon county cost, will be made to replace a missing or stolen meter. 
                  (6)  Miscellaneous service calls. Service calls to uncover meters, raise meters where the yard has been backfilled or landscaped, or repair meter boxes or meter connections will be billed at county cost. 
                  (7)  Returned checks. A processing fee will be charged for returned checks. If water service has been discontinued as a result of the returned check, the services in subsections (1) and (4) of this section will also apply. 
                  (8)  Failure to apply for service. A fee will be charged to users who have not properly applied for service in their own name. A separate fee shall be charged for each trip made by the county in an effort to have the customer properly and successfully apply for service. Payment must be made by the applicant for all water services utilized subsequent to the former customer discontinuing service. 
                  (9)  Water service deposits. Unless otherwise authorized in writing by the department director, a deposit is required on all accounts at the time water service is connected. This deposit shall be as defined within the rate schedule. The deposit shall be held on account for a period of not less than 24 months. After an account has established an excellent payment record for a consecutive 24-month period, the deposit shall be refunded. An excellent payment record shall mean there is no incident of delinquency, returned check, or a regular pattern of payment when past due, all as determined by the department director. The method of refund will be as a credit to the account or as a separate payment. If a deposit has been refunded and the account subsequently becomes delinquent, a deposit shall be required to be reestablished on the account, or arrangements approved by the department director made, prior to reestablishment of service. If an account is closed prior to a deposit refund, the deposit amount shall be applied to the final bill and a balance mailed to the customer as a credit refund. The county shall be under no obligation to deposit any service deposits in an interest-bearing account, and any interest earned on such monies while in the control of the county shall be the exclusive property of the county. 
                  (10)  Unauthorized connection or usage. Fees will be charged for unauthorized water system connections and also for the unauthorized use of county water system services in an amount equal to the connection fees, usage fee, and other fees and charges that would have otherwise been charged for such connection and usage if the user had been authorized to make such connection and use such water services. 
                  (11)  Other services. For any services not falling within the above definitions, the county may fix a charge on the basis of cost of labor and materials required. 
                  (12)  When service charges payable; disconnection of service for failure to pay. The payment of the sum due shall be made monthly or at such other time as indicated by the county in accordance with a statement setting forth the amount due. Payment for services billed monthly and not made within 20 days from the due date shall be subject to a surcharge of ten percent of the delinquent account; provided that such surcharge shall in no event exceed the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the county as a result of such delinquency. The amount of such surcharge shall be established, in writing, by the department director from time to time based on such costs incurred. The failure to make any monthly payments for 60 days after the original due date shall result in water service to the premises being discontinued, with or without notice. Failure to receive notice of the amount due shall in no way relieve the customer, or owner of the property served, from making payment as provided in this section. Should any customer, including the owner of the property, receiving water service fail to pay any non-reoccurring, monthly sum due pursuant to this section, the water service shall be discontinued until such sums, with penalties as provided in this chapter, are paid in full. The remedies specified herein shall be in addition to any other remedies and penalties authorized in this chapter. 
                  (13)  Reconnection charge when water service interrupted for failure to pay service charge. Upon the failure of any customer receiving water service to make payment, the water service shall be interrupted, and in that event a reconnection charge shall be assessed and collected with all arrearage due before the water service will be restored; provided that the department director may authorize that the payment of such arrearage be made in installments, as determined by the department director to be reasonable and appropriate given the particular circumstances. 
                  (14)  Oversized meter boxes. The customer shall additionally be responsible for the cost of any meter boxes or meter vaults which exceed the standard dimensions or specifications for water meter boxes prescribed by the department director, as well as any other costs and expenses incurred by the county in connection therewith.

In the event of such termination under this section, the county shall retain all rights to collect unpaid bills or amounts owed by the terminated user according to law or other provisions of this chapter. Such rates or charges, if not paid when due, shall constitute a lien upon the premises served, though no such lien shall be imposed against the premises to secure unpaid charges for water furnished unless the owner of such real property is the person who incurred the charges. Past due amounts shall bear interest at the same rate as would unpaid ad valorem taxes. 
                  (b)  Restoration of service to rental property.

Selections shall proceed in a like manner until the end of the list is reached, at which point, a towing and recovery service operator shall be selected from the top of the list, and so on, consecutively. The order of towing and recovery service operators on each list shall be as shown on the list maintained by the county 911 center as it exists as of such date or as otherwise directed by the county administrator. Thereafter, each list shall be regularly updated by the licensing officer, with any new licensees being added to the appropriate list in the order in which their application was approved. No towing and recovery service operator may be listed on any one list more than once, and may in no event use alternate legal entities or employ other strategies so as to effectively circumvent said limitation. When a towing and recovery service operator has failed or refused to respond as required herein, or has failed to reach a vehicle within the time prescribed herein, said operator shall be passed over on the applicable rotation list and shall be deemed to have responded for purposes of determining selection on the following call. The county 911 central dispatcher (or other authorized officer) shall call towing and recovery service operators in accordance with the applicable rotating list based on the instructions of the public safety officer or other responsible official at the scene. 
                  (b)  Any wreckers called by the county 911 central dispatcher shall be required to reach the vehicle to be hauled within 45 minutes of said dispatcher's call, and after said 45-minute period said dispatcher shall be authorized to call the next towing and recovery service operator eligible for a call on the list maintained pursuant to subsection (a) of this section. The refusal or failure of any towing and recovery service operator to immediately answer any call shall be deemed a refusal to answer. The failure or refusal to answer a call, or the failure to reach a vehicle within the time prescribed, three or more times within any six-month period shall be grounds for suspension or revocation of the license issued hereunder.

Three days' notice shall be deemed reasonable, but shorter or longer periods of notice shall be authorized as the board of commissioners may deem the circumstances justify. Unless the circumstances otherwise justify, the hearing shall be generally held no later than 45 days after the fully completed application is filed with the licensing officer, or after the licensing officer has suspended a license. If a license is denied by the licensing officer under this article, the reasons for such denial shall be set forth in writing to the applicant. The applicant shall have 30 days following receipt of notice of denial to appeal the decision of the licensing officer to the governing authority, which shall review such application de novo at the next regular meeting of the governing authority following receipt of any such appeal, or, at the election of said governing authority, at a special meeting within 45 days following said appeal; provided, however, that any appeal received within ten business days prior to the next regular meeting of the governing authority shall be heard at the second regularly scheduled meeting of said governing authority following receipt of said appeal. If the governing authority affirms the decision of the licensing officer, then the license shall be denied. If the decision of the licensing officer is reversed, then the license shall be issued to the applicant.

                  (b)  The licensing officer may suspend a license where there is evidence of due cause under subsection (c) of this section for revoking the license. Such action by the licensing officer shall be reported, in writing, to the governing authority. This action shall be reviewed at the next regular meeting of the governing authority, or, at the election of said governing authority, at a special meeting within 30 days following said suspension. If the governing authority affirms the decision of the licensing officer, then the license shall be permanently revoked. If the decision of the licensing officer is reversed, then the license shall be returned to the licensee immediately. Alternatively, the governing authority may elect to return the license to the licensee subject to such reasonable conditions as the governing authority deems appropriate. 
                  (c)  A license or application therefor under this article may be denied, suspended or revoked if one or more of the following exists: 
                  (1)  The applicant or licensee has failed to obtain any paper, permit, approval, or document required under this article. 
                  (2)  The applicant or licensee has supplied false information to the licensing officer or the governing authority. 
                  (3)  The applicant or licensee has violated any federal, state, or local statute, ordinance, regulation, rule, or law applicable to the towing and recovery services, to include, without limitation, any provision contained in this article.

                  3.15. - Home occupations. 
                  A.  Intent and purpose. Certain occupational uses termed "home occupations" are allowed in dwelling units on the basis that such uses are incidental to the use of the premises as a residence. In this regard, such home occupations shall be subject to special regulations to ensure that the same will not be a detriment to the character and livability of the surrounding neighborhood. The regulations ensure that the accessory home occupation remains subordinate to the residential use and the residential viability of the dwelling is maintained. The regulations recognize that many types of jobs can be done in a home with little or no effect on the surrounding neighborhood and, as such, may be permitted provided such uses: 
                  1.  Are incidental to the use of the premises as a residence; 
                  2.  Are conducted within the bona fide residence of the principal practitioner; 
                  3.  Are compatible with residential uses; 
                  4.  Are limited in extent and do not detract from the residential character of the neighborhood. 
                  B.  Definition of accessory home occupations. There are two (2) types of home occupations, Type A and Type B. Permit requirements and uses allowed in each type vary and are allowed only if they comply with all of the requirements of this ordinance. Deviation from any standard requires a variance approval from the board of commissioners. 
                  1.  In Type A home occupations, residents use their home as a place of work, home office or business telephone or mailing address. Employees or customers are prohibited from coming to the site, and there is no visible indication of commercial activity. By way of illustration only, examples include artists, craftspeople, writers and consultants. Type A home occupations may be approved administratively by the zoning administrator or his designee. 
                  2.  In Type B home occupations, the resident uses their home for work which requires or results in either employees or customers coming to the site on an infrequent basis. Examples are counseling, tutoring, child/adult care homes, and single-chair haircutting and styling. Type B home occupations must obtain a conditional use permit from the board of commissioners due to their greater possible impact on the surrounding neighborhood as a result of individuals and visitors from outside the neighborhood coming to the property. 
                  C.  General provisions and prohibited uses. All home occupations shall meet the following: 
                  1.  A home occupation shall be incidental and accessory to the use of a dwelling as a residence. No more than twenty (20) percent of the floorspace of the dwelling unit (including attached garages) may be used for the home occupation. 
                  2.  There shall be no exterior evidence of the home occupation or alteration of the residence and/or accessory buildings to accommodate the home occupation. Internal or external changes which will make the dwelling appear less residential in nature or function are prohibited. Examples of such prohibited alterations include construction of parking lots, paving of required setbacks, or adding commercial-like exterior lighting. 
                  3.  There shall be no outside operations or exterior storage of inventory, equipment, or materials to be used in conjunction with a home occupation. 
                  4.  Off-site employees of the resident shall not congregate on the premises for any purpose concerning the home occupation nor park their personal vehicles at the location. 
                  5.  No more than one (1) vehicle associated with the home occupation (no larger than a standard van or pickup truck and with minimal commercial markings as approved by the zoning administrator) may be parked at the site. Such vehicle is limited to one-ton carrying capacity and must be used exclusively by the resident and parked on a valid improved surface constructed of materials common in conventional residential development (e.g., concrete, pavers, etc.) and which is otherwise compatible with the surrounding neighborhood. 
                  6.  No use or activity may create an offensive noise, dust, glare, vibration, smoke, smell, electrical interference or any fire hazard, unsightly or unhealthful condition, or other nuisance or disturbance. 
                  7.  All home occupations shall be subject to periodic inspections by the department of planning and zoning. 
                  8.  Any type of repair or assembly of vehicles or equipment with internal combustion engines (such as autos, motorcycles, marine engines, lawn mowers, chain saws and other small engines) or of large appliances (such as washing machines, dryers, and refrigerators) or any other work related to automobiles and their parts is prohibited. 
                  9.  Accessory home occupations may not serve as headquarters or dispatch centers where employees come to the site and are dispatched to other locations. 
                  D.  Specific criteria for Type A home occupations. In addition to the general criteria established in subsection C., Type A home occupations are subject to the following restrictions: 
                  1.  No clients, nonresident employees or customers are allowed on the premises. 
                  2.  Pickups from and deliveries to the site in regard to the business shall be restricted to vehicles which have no more than two (2) axles and shall be restricted to no more than two (2) pickups or deliveries per day between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. 
                  3.  No signage regarding the home occupation is permitted on the property. 
                  4.  No advertisement shall be placed in any media (including flyers soliciting business) containing the address of the property. 
                  5.  Retail sales are prohibited. 
                  E.  Specific criteria for Type B home occupations. In addition to the general criteria established in subsection C., Type B home occupations are subject to the following restrictions: 
                  1.  A conditional use permit must be obtained from the board of commissioners following a public hearing. The board of commissioners shall consider the desires of the immediate neighborhood, the nature of the proposed business, the availability of parking, traffic generation and any other issue that may detract from the residential character of the area and property values. The public hearing shall follow the same procedures as set forth in section 7.3 and article IX of the Zoning Ordinance of Liberty County, Georgia. 
                  2.  No Type B home occupation may be established in districts zoned for multifamily residential purposes or zoned R-4. 
                  3.  Two (2) nonresident employees are allowed with a Type B home occupation provided no customers come to the site and adequate parking is provided on-site. Home occupations which have customers coming to the site are not allowed to have nonresident employees (defined as an employee, business partner, co-owner, or other person affiliated with the home occupation, who does not live at the site, but who visits the site as part of the home occupation). 
                  4.  Retail sales of goods must be entirely accessory to any permitted services provided on the site (such as hair care products sold as an accessory to haircutting); except that the sale of garden produce grown on the premises within A-1 or AR-1 zoning districts shall be permitted in accordance with this ordinance, provided that this exception shall not extend to allow the operation of a commercial greenhouse or nursery or the existence of stands or booths for display of such produce. 
                  5.  No more than one (1) Type B home occupation per dwelling is permitted. 
                  6.  Customers may visit the site only between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Unless otherwise specifically approved by the board of commissioners, no more than two (2) customers or other business visitors shall be permitted at any one (1) time at the residence. 
                  7.  Unless otherwise specifically approved by the board of commissioners, no signage shall be permitted. If specifically approved by the board of commissioners, the home occupation is permitted one (1) sign only according to the following criteria: 
                  a)  Signs shall be mounted against the wall of the principal building, and unless otherwise indicated by the board of commissioners shall not exceed one (1) square foot in area; 
                  b)  Signs may not be illuminated in any fashion;

                  3.38. - Purpose of sign regulations. 
                  Liberty County finds that signs are proper and necessary uses of private property, are a means of personal free expression, are a necessary component of a commercial environment, and constitute a legitimate business enterprise. As such, signs are entitled to the protection of the law. In the absence of regulation, however, the number of signs tends to proliferate leading to cluttered and aesthetically blighted roadways. The manner of the erection, location, and maintenance of signs affects the public health, safety, morals, and welfare of the citizens of Liberty County. The following regulations shall apply to all surfaces utilized to advertise a service, product, or business establishment. Separate use signs advertise a service, product, or business establishment not directly related to its location. 
                  3.38.1.  General. 
                  3.38.1.1.  Signable area. The area within a continuous perimeter enclosing the limits of writing, representations, emblems or any figures or similar characters, together with any frame or other material or color forming an integral part of the display or used to differentiate this sign from the background against which it is placed, excluding the necessary supports or uprights on which this sign is placed; provided, that any open space contained within the outer limits of the display face of a sign, or between any component, panel, strip or fixture of any kind composing the display face shall be included in the computation of the area of the sign whether this open space be enclosed or not by a frame or border. For projecting or double-faced signs only one (1) display face shall be measured in computing the sign area when the sign faces are parallel, or where the interior angle formed by the faces is sixty (60) degrees or less provided that it is a common attached structure. If the two (2) faces of a double-faced sign are of unequal area, the area of the sign shall be taken as the area of the larger face. 
                  3.38.1.2.  Miscellaneous. No signs shall be erected within ten (10) feet of an established road right-of-way line except as otherwise provided herein. All signs fifteen (15) feet in height or more require sign installation drawings to be certified by a structural engineer as being designed to meet/exceed one hundred (100) mph winds. If the sign is illuminated, it shall be of an enclosed lamp design and require electrical load calculations and a wiring plan in accordance with NFPA 70 and other documents. All signs must conform with O.C.G.A. § 32-6-75(9) (the Georgia Outdoor Advertising Law). A building permit shall be required for all signs larger than thirty-two (32) square feet located within the county. All signs which have external illumination shall have appropriate methods of deactivating illumination during daylight hours. On-premises signs which are capable of multiple messages, changeable messages or displays shall be illuminated by LEDs or similar technology and integrate an automatic dimmer and shall remain fixed for not less than fifteen (15) seconds, and the message transition shall occur in a period not to exceed two (2) seconds. Off-premises billboards and signs (as referred to in sections 3.38.2 and 3.38.3) which are capable of multiple messages, changeable messages or displays shall be illuminated by LEDs or similar technology and integrate an automatic dimmer and shall remain fixed for not less than ten (10) seconds, and the message transition shall occur in a period not to exceed two (2) seconds. Additionally, any multiple or changeable message sign or display shall contain a default design that will freeze the sign or display in one (1) position if a malfunction occurs. 
                  3.38.2.  Billboards (signs) adjacent to the interstate highway system. Signs adjacent to the Interstate system of roads shall meet all federal and state requirements necessary to obtain a permit under the Georgia Outdoor Advertising Law.

                  3.38.2.4.  Height above Interstate. All signs shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet in height above the highest point of pavement of the Interstate. According to regulations, signs shall not exceed seventy (70) feet in height above the center of the road.

                  3.38.2.6.  Limitation per location. No more than one (1) sign shall face in any one (1) direction per location.

No multiple message or changeable message signs may be located within five thousand (5,000) feet of another multiple message sign on the same side of the highway. 
                  3.38.2.8.  Location limitation. A maximum of three (3) sign locations shall be allowed per quadrant at any interchange where spacing requirements can be met. For purposes of enforcement, a quadrant shall be defined as the land area adjacent to the interstate highway right-of-way on either side beginning at the center line of the intersecting route and extending one thousand three hundred twenty (1,320) linear feet (.25 miles) along the length of the interstate away from said intersecting road.

                  3.38.2.12.  Local permits. No person shall construct or maintain any outdoor advertising on an interstate without first obtaining a permit from the Liberty County Building and Licensing Department. This does not eliminate the need for a state permit. 
                  3.38.3.  Billboards adjacent to county-designated roads and other routes on the state highway system. Signs adjacent to the county-designated road system of arterials and major collectors shall only be allowed on undeveloped parcels that are zoned as B-2 (General Commercial), or I-1 (Industrial) and shall meet the requirements contained in sections 3.38.3.1 through 3.38.3.9.

                  5.9.1.  Submission of plans. The owner of a tract of land zoned for industrial uses shall submit to the planning commission for its review a plan for the use and development of each tract of land. It shall then be the duty of the planning commission to investigate and ascertain whether the proposed activity complies with all of the provisions of this ordinance which pertain to "I-1" districts. The commission may employ experts in specific fields as needed, and as funds are available, to determine whether a proposed use meets the required performance standards. 
                  5.9.2.  Referral and authorization. A report of its findings shall be furnished by the commission to the governing authority. The commission may suggest disapproval, recommend the plan as submitted, or may modify, alter, adjust or amend the plan before recommendation, and in recommending it, may propose the prescribing of other conditions. The report of the planning commission to the governing authority shall be in writing, and shall include a finding as to whether the proposed use is consistent with the applicable provisions and requirements of the zoning ordinance. If the governing authority finds that the proposed use is consistent with the purpose of the zoning ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, it may direct the proper official to authorize a permit. 
                  5.9.3.  Performance standards. All industrial uses must conform to the following performance standards: 
                  5.9.3.1.  Smoke. The emission of grey smoke at a density greater than No. 1 on the Ringlemann Chart published by the U.S. Bureau of Mines (Power's Micro-Ringlemann Chart, McGraw-Hill Publishing Co., 1954, may be used) shall not be permitted except grey smoke of a shade not darker than No. 2 may be emitted for not more than four (4) minutes in any thirty (30) minutes. These provisions, applicable to grey smoke, shall also apply to visible smoke of a different color but with equivalent apparent capacity. 
                  5.9.3.2.  Odor. No emission of unpleasant gases or other odorous matter shall be permitted in such quantities as to be offensive outside the lot lines of the tract. Any process which may involve the creation of emission of any odors shall be provided with secondary safeguard system, so that control will be maintained if the primary safeguard system should fail. There is hereby established as a guide in determining such quantities of offensive odors Table 3 (Odor Thresholds) in Chapter 5, "Air Pollution Abatement Manual," copyright 1951, by Manufacturing Chemists Association, Inc., Washington, D.C. Where said publication gives a range of figures a simple average of these shall be used. 
                  5.9.3.3.  Toxic gases. The emission of gases or fumes injurious to persons or property beyond the lot lines occupied by the use is prohibited. 
                  5.9.3.4.  Glare and heat. Glare and heat from arc welding, acetylene torch cutting or similar processes shall be performed so as not to produce glare which is visible, or objectionable heat, beyond the property line of the lot on which the operation is located. Direct glare from incandescent exposed lights shall not be visible from adjoining streets or properties. 
                  5.9.3.5.  Sewage. No discharge is permitted at any point in any private sewage disposal system or stream or into the ground, of any materials in such a way or of such nature or temperature as could contaminate any water supply, or otherwise cause the emission of dangerous objectionable elements. 
                  5.9.3.6.  Vibration. Any use creating intense earthshaking vibration shall be set back as far as possible from the lot lines on all sides, and, in no case shall any such vibration be perceptible along any lot line. 
                  5.9.4.  Uses prohibited. 
                  5.9.4.1.  Residential subdivisions and developments and the construction of dwellings on existing lots zoned as industrial except for dwellings for watchmen, caretakers or farms.

                  5.10. - "PUD" Planned Unit Development districts. 
                  5.10.1.  PUD, intent. The PUD district is established to encourage innovative and creative design of residential and/or commercial developments and to permit a greater amount of flexibility to a developer by removing some of the restrictions of conventional zoning. Ideally, the development should be large scale and incorporate a variety of land uses or land use types. The district is also intended to encourage developments which provide a full range of residential types to serve the residents of the district. 
                  The regulations should provide a mechanism to evaluate each application on its own merit. It is recognized that some concepts will be more appropriate than others and the approval of an application in one (1) location does not necessarily indicate the development will be applicable in other locations. It should also be emphasized that these provisions are not to be used to circumvent the intent or use of conventional zoning classifications as set forth in this chapter. 
                  5.10.2.  Minimum site size. The minimum site size for any PUD is five (5) acres. 
                  5.10.3.  Minimum lot area. No minimum lot area is required for any specific structure within a PUD. 
                  5.10.4.  Minimum lot width, minimum yard requirements, maximum lot coverage, maximum height of structures. No structure shall be erected within twenty-five (25) feet from any external lot line of any PUD. Minimum lot width, minimum yard sizes, maximum lot coverage, and maximum height are not otherwise regulated within PUD districts; provided, however, that the planning commission and board of commissioners shall ascertain that the characteristics of building siting shall be appropriate as related to structures within the PUD and otherwise fulfill the intent of this appendix. 
                  5.10.5.  PUD application and preliminary development plan approval. 
                  5.10.5.1.  Prior to submitting a PUD application, the applicant is encouraged to meet with the LCPC staff for a pre-application conference to avoid undue delay in the review process after the application is submitted. 
                  5.10.5.2.  Applications for a PUD district shall include the following:

                  5.10.5.2.2.  Statement of intent. The applicant shall submit three (3) copies of a report (and electronic files of same) setting forth the characteristics of the proposed PUD including the following: 
                  a.  A description of the procedures of any proposed homeowner's association or other group maintenance agreement. 
                  b.  A statement setting forth the proposed development schedule.

                  5.10.5.2.6.  Following approval of a PUD district, the official zoning map shall be amended to reflect such approval. Approval of a PUD district shall constitute authority for the applicant to submit a proposed development plan to the secretary of the planning commission for approval in accordance with the provisions of section 5.10.7.

                  5.14.13.1.  Any existing use, which was lawfully established at the time of the effective date of this article, may be continued; although, such use does not conform to the provisions hereof. However, the requirements set forth in this section shall be applicable to the portion of the use subject to enlargement, extension, conversion, reconstruction or structural alteration, and not be retroactive to the entire pre-existing structure. Nothing shall prohibit the reconstruction of a building legally in use at the time of the adoption of this article. A request for enlargement, extension, conversion, reconstruction or structural alteration of a pre-existing use which does not conform to the provisions of this article shall be processed through the permit procedures for nonconforming uses and structures as set forth in article III, sections 3.23—3.25 of the Zoning Ordinance of Liberty County. 
                  5.14.13.2.  The permit to enlarge, extend, convert, reconstruct, or alter a structure lawfully in existence at the time of the enactment of this section, shall not be conditioned upon the execution of an avigation and noise easement pursuant to section 5.14.12.

The garrison commander or his/her designee shall verify receipt of such information and, within a reasonable time period, forward any comments concerning the request to the chief building official. 
                  5.14.14.3.  Any use located within the MIZOD and utilized in connection with the operations of Fort Stewart/WAAF; properties owned or leased by Liberty County; any public authority; military units; or other governmental agencies, except for private or public educational facilities are hereby declared compatible and shall be exempted from the requirements of this article. 
                  5.14.15.  Protection. 
                  5.14.15.1.  The degree of protection provided by this article is reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on planning, engineering and scientific methods of study and in coordination with aviation and defense agencies. This article does not imply that areas outside of the MIZOD area will be totally free from noise impacts and aircraft hazards, and, therefore, shall not create a liability on the part of Liberty County, or any of its officers or employees, for any damages resulting from reliance on this article. 
                  5.14.16.  Variances. 
                  5.14.16.1.  Variances shall not be permitted from the height limits or use regulations for properties within any noise zone or air safety zone of this overlay district. Additionally, no application for a variance to the other requirements of this article may be considered by the governing authority unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the garrison commander or his/her designee for a written recommendation as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the garrison commander or his/her designee does not respond to the application within thirty (30) days after receipt, the governing authority may act on its own to grant or deny the application.

                  7.3.1.1.  To hear and decide appeals where an error is alleged in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the zoning official in the enforcement of any section or article adopted pursuant to this ordinance. 
                  7.3.1.2.  To hear and decide special exceptions to the terms of the ordinance upon which such board is required to pass. 
                  7.3.1.3.  To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of the ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Such variance may be granted in such individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the governing authority that: 
                  (a)  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography; 
                  (b)  The application of the ordinance to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship; 
                  (c)  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and 
                  (d)  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of the ordinance; provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by the ordinance. In exercising the above powers, the governing authority may, in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirements, decision, or determination, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit. 
                  7.3.2.  Variances. On an appeal from an order, requirement, decision or determination of the zoning official, or any other administrative officer or agency, the governing authority may grant a variance in the application of the provisions of the zoning ordinance, only if all of the following findings are made: 
                  7.3.2.1.  That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property, and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions, and not to circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of the zoning ordinance in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located. 
                  7.3.2.2.  That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the zoning ordinance, and that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.

                  k.  Are there unique conditions which support approval or denial?

Any such towers or antennas shall be referred to in this article as "pre-existing towers" or "pre-existing antennas"; provided, however, that the placement of antennas on any nonconforming structure shall not create a vested right for the continued use of the structures should the nonconforming use cease. 
                  If an additional antenna is co-located upon a pre-existing tower after adoption of this article, then the requirements of sections 12.4.4 (except subsection 12.4.4(f)), 12.4.6 and 12.4.7. shall be met as part of the permitting process. 
                  (Ord. No. 2000-002, § I, 10-3-2000; Ord. No. 2012-001, 3-15-2012) 
                  12.4. - General provisions. 
                  12.4.1.  Principal or accessory use. A tower and/or antenna is considered a principal use if located on any lot or parcel of land as the sole or primary structure, and is considered an accessory use if located on a lot or parcel shared with a different existing primary use or existing structure. An existing use or structure on the same lot or parcel shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with zoning district requirements, including, but not limited to, setback, buffer and other requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot or parcel shall control, even though the antenna or tower may be located on a leased area within such lot or parcel. Towers that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this article shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use of structure. 
                  12.4.2.  Co-location; design requirements. In addition to all applicable building and safety codes, all towers, except amateur radio towers, shall be designed to accommodate the co-location of cellular telecommunication antennas according to the following: 
                  (a)  For towers up to one hundred fifty (150) feet in height, the structure and fenced compound shall be designed to accommodate at least three (3) providers or the maximum number of users as determined by the most current technology, whichever is greater; 
                  (b)  For towers greater than one hundred fifty (150) feet in height, the structure and fenced compound shall be designed to accommodate at least four (4) providers or the maximum number of users as determined by the most current technology, whichever is greater. 
                  12.4.3.  Co-location; availability of suitable existing structures. No new tower except amateur radio towers, shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the administrator and/or governing authority (as the case may be) that no existing tower or existing alternative tower structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. All evidence submitted shall be signed and sealed by appropriate licensed professionals or qualified industry experts. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the proposed antenna shall consist of the following: 
                  (a)  That no existing towers or suitable alternative tower structures are located within the geographic antenna placement area which will allow for the effective operation of the proposed antenna (as informed by industry standards); 
                  (b)  That existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to allow for the effective operation of the proposed antenna (as informed by industry standards); 
                  (c)  That existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's antenna and related equipment (as informed by industry standards); 
                  (d)  That the applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna(s) on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna, and such interference cannot be effectively remedied; 
                  (e)  That the cost or contractual provisions required by the tower owner to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing substantially exceed the cost and requirements of new tower development and are otherwise entirely unreasonable; 
                  (f)  That the applicant adequately demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable, other than economic reasons. 
                  12.4.4.  Aesthetics. The guidelines set forth in this section shall govern the design and construction of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this article. 
                  (a)  Towers and/or antennas shall either maintain a galvanized steel or concrete finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  (b)  At all tower sites, the design of all buildings and related structures shall use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and building environment. Any equipment or cabinet that supports telecommunication facilities must be concealed from public view and made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be concealed from public view by using landscaping and materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained. 
                  (c)  For antennas installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical ground equipment shall be of a neutral color so as to make the antenna and related equipment visually unobtrusive. 
                  (d)  Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the governing authority may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. The lighting shall be dimmed or changed to red lights from the sunset to sunrise. 
                  (e)  No signage or other identifying markings of a commercial nature shall be permitted upon any tower or alternative tower structure within Liberty County. 
                  (f)  To the extent practical, telecommunication facilities shall not be placed in a direct line of sight with historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing authority or by any state or federal law or agency. 
                  (g)  Access to the tower site shall be restricted so as to minimize visibility of the access. Where possible, existing roads shall be used. Where no roads exist, access shall follow the existing contours of the land so as to minimize the visual impact of the site on the surrounding area. 
                  (h)  Such other additional requirements as the administrator and/or governing authority (as the case may be) shall reasonably require to minimize the visual impact of the site on the surrounding area. 
                  12.4.5.  Setbacks and separation. The following setbacks and separation requirements shall apply to all towers: 
                  (a)  Towers shall be set back a minimum distance equal to the height of the tower from its base to any public right-of-way or occupied structure, or property line of the lot or parcel containing the tower. 
                  (b)  Guy-wires and accessory buildings and facilities shall meet the minimum accessory use location and setback requirements. 
                  (c)  Towers shall not be located closer than five thousand two hundred eighty (5,280) feet from any existing tower; provided, however, that the administrator or governing authority may waive this requirement when it is determined that the placement of another tower within said five thousand two hundred eighty (5,280) feet is technologically required or visually preferable. This requirement shall not apply to amateur radio towers. 
                  12.4.6.  Security fencing/anti-climbing devices. All towers and supporting equipment shall be enclosed by fencing not less than six (6) feet in height and shall also be equipped with appropriate anti-climbing devices. Fencing shall be of chain link, wood or other approved alternative. 
                  12.4.7.  Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern landscaping surrounding all towers. 
                  (a)  Where adequate vegetation is not present, tower facilities shall be landscaped with a landscaped strip of plant materials which effectively screens the view of the tower compound. Landscaped strips shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet in width and eight (8) feet in height at planting and located outside the fenced perimeter of the compound. 
                  (b)  Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. Where natural vegetation around the perimeter of the site would provide an adequate visual screen, an undisturbed buffer may be utilized. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost. 
                  (c)  Landscaping shall be maintained by the provider and shall be subject to periodic review by the administrator to assure proper maintenance. Failure to maintain landscaping shall be deemed a violation of this article. 
                  Amateur radio towers and antennas, or receive-only antennas shall not be subject to this section unless specifically required by the governing authority by virtue of other provisions of the Zoning Ordinance of Liberty County, Georgia. 
                  12.4.8.  Maintenance impact. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector or local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector or local street, utilizing existing access to the property on which such facility is to be located, where possible. 
                  12.4.9.  Federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, the permittee, owner or the lessee of the tower and/or antenna governed by this article shall bring such tower and/or antenna into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6) months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more or less stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring such tower and/or antenna into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall be deemed to be a declaration of abandonment of the tower and/or antenna and constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's, permittee's, or lessee's expense. Any such removal by the governing authority shall be in the manner provided by section 5-84 et seq. of the Code of Ordinances of Liberty County, Georgia, governing unsafe or abandoned structures. 
                  12.4.10.  Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner, permittee or subsequent lessee of a tower or alternative tower structure shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the administrator concludes that a tower fails to comply with all applicable codes and standards, or constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon receipt of written notice by the owner, permittee or lessee of the tower, said party shall have fifteen (15) days to bring the tower into compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such tower into compliance within fifteen (15) days shall be deemed a declaration of abandonment of the tower and constitute grounds for removal of the tower as provided in section 5-84 et seq. of the Code of Ordinances of Liberty County, Georgia, governing unsafe or abandoned structures. Prior to the removal of any tower, the administrator may consider detailed plans submitted by the owner, permittee or subsequent lessee for repair of substandard towers, and may grant a reasonable extension of the above referenced compliance period. 
                  12.4.11.  Change of ownership notification. Upon the transfer of an ownership interest in any tower, alternative tower structure, or lot upon which such a structure has been erected, the tower permittee shall notify the administrator of the transaction in writing within thirty (30) days.

                  12.7.1.  General. 
                  (a)  If the proposed location, height, setback or other aspect of a proposed telecommunications facility cannot comply with the minimum requirements established in this article or are otherwise ineligible for administrative approval pursuant to section 12.6, then a conditional use permit shall be required for the construction of a tower or the placement of an antenna in any zoning district. All such uses shall comply with requirements set forth in this article and all other applicable codes and ordinances, unless the applicant can show that the denial of a permit in such a location will cause a significantly harmful and permanent degradation of service which cannot be overcome by any other means including planned or potential locations which would provide the same or similar coverage or capacity. 
                  (b)  In granting a conditional use permit, the governing authority may impose additional conditions to the extent that it concludes such conditions are necessary to minimize adverse effects from the proposed tower on adjoining or nearby properties as set out in section 12.7.5. 
                  12.7.2.  Application; contents; fee. All applications for conditional use permits shall be submitted to the administrator who shall forward the same to the governing authority for its consideration.

                  12.7.3.  Co-location of antennas required. Applicants for the erection of a tower or antenna, except amateur radio operators, shall be required to co-locate upon an existing tower structure. An exception to co-location shall only be made if the applicant adequately demonstrates that an existing tower suitable for co-location does not exist in the geographic antenna placement area, and that no suitable alternative tower structure is available as set forth in section 12.4.3 contained herein. 
                  12.7.4.  Public hearing. Before taking action upon the proposed conditional use permit, the governing authority shall hold a public hearing on the matter.

                  (a)  A sign shall be erected, in a conspicuous location, on or adjacent to the property under consideration. The sign shall state the time, place, location, and purpose of the public hearing. 
                  (b)  A letter shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to all property owners of record of abutting parcels, and to all property owners of residentially-used parcels lying in whole or in part within a distance of two (2) times the height of the proposed tower as measured from its base (as such property owners may be reasonably ascertained by the administrator), giving notice of the public hearing. The letter shall state the same information as required for the sign. 
                  (c)  A public notice shall be published in the newspaper in which the sheriff's advertisements appear once a week for two (2) consecutive weeks prior to the date of the hearing. 
                  (d)  Subsections (b) and (c) above shall be the responsibility of, and at the expense of, the applicant. 
                  12.7.5.  Considerations in approval or denial of conditional use permits. Any denial of a request to place, construct or modify a telecommunications facility shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record. The following factors may be taken into consideration in acting upon a conditional use permit application under the provisions of this article: 
                  (a)  The height and setbacks of the proposed tower, antenna, and equipment and structures in support thereof; 
                  (b)  The proximity of the tower, antenna, and equipment and structures in support thereof to residential structures and residential district boundaries; 
                  (c)  The nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties; 
                  (d)  The surrounding topography; 
                  (e)  The surrounding tree coverage and foliage; 
                  (f)  The design of the tower, antenna, and equipment and structures in support thereof, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness; 
                  (g)  The proposed ingress and egress; 
                  (h)  The availability of suitable existing towers or other structures for antenna co-location; 
                  (i)  The impact of the proposed tower, antenna, and equipment and structures in support thereof upon scenic views and visual quality of the surrounding area; 
                  (j)  The needs of the applicant as balanced against the detrimental effects on surrounding properties; 
                  (k)  The impact of the proposed tower or antenna(s) on adjacent and nearby properties; and 
                  (l)  Such other considerations as may be implicated by the provisions of this article. 
                  12.7.6.  Requirements for issuance of conditional use permit. The conditional use permit may be issued by the governing authority only upon satisfaction of the following requirements: 
                  (a)  A proper application filed in accordance with the requirements of section 12.5; 
                  (b)  The application is otherwise in compliance with the conditions for the proposed conditional use required by this section; 
                  (c)  The applicant complies with the conditions imposed by the governing authority for the purpose of reducing the harmful effects of the use on surrounding uses and ensuring compatibility with surrounding uses; 
                  (d)  The governing authority determines that the benefits and need for the proposed conditional use are greater than any possible depreciating effects or damages to neighboring or nearby properties; and 
                  (e)  All fees and other expenses required have been paid in full. 
                  12.7.7.  Independent expert review.

If the applicant is unable to address those concerns to the satisfaction of the administrator or governing authority, the applicant shall be allowed a reasonable amount of time, not to exceed thirty (30) days, following the receipt of the letter to such effect, in which to modify the application to alleviate the administrator's or governing authority's concerns or withdraw the application altogether. If the applicant fails to so modify or withdraw the application within the required time, the administrator or governing authority may proceed to engage a licensed professional engineer to conduct the independent expert review and the expert's reasonable fees, costs and expenses shall be paid by the applicant; provided that the administrator or governing authority shall give the applicant written notice of its intent to do so. The expert's opinion shall not necessarily be determinative, but shall be a significant factor to be considered in granting or denying the application. No permit shall issue until the applicant has paid all such fees, costs and expenses incurred under this section. 
                  12.7.8.  Resubmittal of conditional use application. An application for a conditional use permit which has been denied shall not be resubmitted for a period of six (6) months and then only if the applicant can document a substantial change in need for a tower or antenna at the same location.

                  The procedure for review and approval of a subdivision plat consists of five (5) separate steps. These are: 
                  (a)  Review of sketch plan by the planning commission/governing authority. (Optional.) 
                  (b)  Review and recommendation of preliminary plat by the planning commission. 
                  (c)  Review and approval of preliminary plat by governing authority. 
                  (d)  Review and approval of proposed development plan by governing authority staff. 
                  (e)  Review and approval of the final plat by the governing authority. 
                  Step (a) may and steps (b) and (c) and (d) shall be completed prior to making any street improvements, or installing any utilities. Step (e) shall be completed prior to the sale of any lots in the proposed subdivision. The site proposed to be subdivided must be zoned in the appropriate residential, commercial, industrial, planned development or other zoning district prior to the completion of step (b). 
                  Sec. 4.2. - Review procedure. 
                  The following procedure shall be followed in the submission, review, and action upon all subdivision plats: 
                  4.2.1  Sketch plan review procedures. Prior to the filing of a preliminary plat, the subdivider may submit to the secretary of the planning commission a simple sketch plan of the proposed subdivision. The sketch plan may be a simple freehand drawing. Included with the sketch plan should be a sketch map, which shows the subdivision in relation to the surrounding area. The purpose of the sketch plan is to assist the subdivider prior to extensive site planning for the preparation of the preliminary plat and enable the subdivider to become familiar with the regulations affecting the land to be subdivided. The secretary of the planning commission shall coordinate for the review of the sketch plan for zoning measures and approve, disapprove, or approve with modification the sketch plan zoning within fifteen (15) days from the meeting at which it is presented. Pertinent comments and recommendations shall be noted in the minutes of the planning commission meeting. The secretary shall also forward copies of the sketch plan to the governing authority for review. 
                  4.2.2  Preliminary plat procedures. Application for preliminary approval of a subdivision plat shall be submitted to the secretary of the planning commission at least twenty-five (25) days prior to the regularly scheduled meeting date of the planning commission. The plat of the subdivision shall be submitted in six (6) blackline or blueline prints and shall be such as to meet the minimum requirements contained herein, as well as one (1) electronic copy in a read-only format acceptable to the planning commission. Any preliminary plat submitted to the planning commission shall contain the name and address of the subdivider (or subdivider's designee) to whom notice of hearing may be sent, and no preliminary plat shall be acted upon by the planning commission without affording a hearing thereon, notice of time and place of which shall be sent to said address not less than five (5) days before the date of the hearing. 
                  (1)  The planning commission may request additional copies of the plat and supplemental information. The above-mentioned copies shall be distributed as required by subsection 5.2.4 of this ordinance and additionally as deemed necessary by the secretary of the planning commission. The person or agency to which a copy of the preliminary plat is directed shall review the preliminary plat and indicate any required changes or comments on the plat and submit to the planning commission prior to the formal presentation of the preliminary plat. The local governing authority shall approve the preliminary plat following action by the planning commission. 
                  (2)  The secretary of the planning commission shall examine the preliminary plat to determine if it meets all requirements of these regulations and shall place a preliminary plat on the agenda of the planning commission for their action. 
                  (3)  Subdivider must provide written assurance of availability of adequate water and sewer service from a public/private provider. If water and/or sewerage systems not connected to a municipal system are to be installed, the subdivider is to indicate who will own the system, who will operate the system, and what assurance will be given to the governing authority for continued operation. 
                  (4)  The planning commission shall act on the preliminary plat within forty-five (45) days after formal submission and having received confirmation of all necessary approvals as described in paragraph 4.2.2(2) above. Failure of the planning commission to act within forty-five (45) days after formal submission of the complete preliminary plat shall be deemed to constitute approval and certificate to that effect shall be issued by the planning commission on demand; provided, however, that the subdivider may waive this requirement and consent in writing to the extension of such period. The action of the commission shall be recorded in the minutes of the commission meeting. 
                  (5)  The planning commission shall vote to approve or disapprove the preliminary plat. Failure of a subdivider to initiate any development within eighteen (18) months from the approval of the preliminary plat will require the preliminary plat to be resubmitted to the planning commission for approval. The developer shall not initiate action to change any of the existing conditions reported on the preliminary plat as required by paragraph 5.2.2 until the preliminary plat has been approved by the governing authority and a proposed development plan approved by the governing authority staff. 
                  (6)  Approval of a preliminary subdivision plat shall not constitute approval of the final subdivision plat. Preliminary approval shall constitute approval of the proposed widths and alignments of streets, location of other required easements, and the dimensions and shapes of lots. Application for approval of the final plat will be considered only after the requirements for final plat approval as specified herein have been fulfilled and after all other specified conditions have been met. Upon approval of the preliminary subdivision plat by the planning commission and the governing authority, the subdivider may proceed to comply with the other requirements of these regulations and the preparation of the final subdivision plat. 
                  4.2.3  Reserved. 
                  4.2.4  Final plat procedure.

Application for approval of a final plat shall be submitted to the secretary of the planning commission. A bond or letter of credit for an amount necessary to complete any remaining primary and secondary improvements, shall be submitted at least ten (10) days prior to the regularly scheduled meeting date of the governing authority. Remaining primary improvements must be completed within six (6) months from the date of final plat approval by the governing authority. Remaining secondary improvements must be completed within two (2) years from the date of final plat approval by the governing authority. 
                  Until a final plat of a subdivision has been submitted to, reviewed and approved and signed by the planning commission and governing authority, the clerk of the superior court of Liberty County shall not record the plat of such subdivision, nor shall the owner or agent of such subdivision transfer title to any lot within the subdivision by reference to the subdivision plat. For large subdivisions, the final plat may be submitted for approval in contiguous sections satisfactory to the governing authority. 
                  The installation of streets, sidewalks, drainage systems, water, non-potable reuse water lines, and sewerage systems, and other improvements shall be in compliance with the governing authority's standard specifications for materials and installation procedures on file with the planning commission and the governing authority's flood regulations. The elevation of fill and the installation of streets, drainage systems, water, nonpotable reuse water lines and or sewerage systems shall be certified by the developer's registered engineer as being in compliance with applicable requirements before approval of the final plat. 
                  4.2.5  Final approval. Final approval of the plat shall be by the governing authority. 
                  4.2.6  Certification by planning commission secretary. The secretary of the planning commission shall certify for recording all plats approved by the governing authority and all plats found to be exceptions under section 4.3 of this ordinance without referral to the governing authority. The planning commission shall retain copies of such plats as information.

                  (1)  Family conveyance exception. When the applicant certifies to the planning commission that the applicant's intended division of the land is only for conveyance to one (1) or more family members for single-family residential or agricultural use in lands currently zoned for agricultural or agricultural and rural residential uses, the secretary of the planning commission may receive the final plat as information and indicate the final plat may be recorded.

                  ARTICLE VI. - REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS 

                  Sec. 6.1. - Required improvements. 
                  A well-designed subdivision or development includes improvements that provide for the safety and security of all citizens, includes adequate open spaces for recreation and circulation, preserves and protects our wetlands, streams and marshes, and promotes the overall public good. A subdivision means little to a prospective lot buyer until such buyer can see actual physical transformation of raw land into lots with all necessary improvements provided. Likewise, a subdivision is not an asset to the community until the necessary improvements have been installed and provide adequate levels of service. In order that prospective lot purchasers may get useable products, and new subdivisions may be an asset rather than a liability to the community, the subdivider shall install and/or pay for the improvements required by these regulations necessary to serve the subdivision prior to the approval of the final plat. Any request for an exception to these required improvements must be documented by the developer, and address the reason for the exception and why it meets the spirit and intent of these regulations. 
                  6.1.1.  Natural gas. When gas lines are located in a street right-of-way, where possible, such lines shall be located outside the portion of the street to be surfaced as per the typical roadway detail to prevent having to cut into the paved surface to serve abutting properties. 
                  6.1.2.  Water supply. All lots, tracts or parcels must be served by a water source. The water source may be an individual water system, a municipal water system, or a community water system. The water source must be approved by the governing authority, the health department and, when necessary, the environmental protection division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. All required improvements must meet the requirements of these agencies. Individual wells shall be installed in accordance with the rules and administrative regulations of the county health department. 
                  (1)  Subdivisions located in any municipality, or near or adjacent to an existing municipal water supply, shall connect to that municipal water supply, unless the municipality certifies that it will not supply water to the proposed development. 
                  (2)  Subdivisions not located within and served by a municipality and located adjacent to an existing private water supply may connect to that water supply provided that the owner agrees to the connection in writing, that the proposed system is approved as mentioned above, and that the existing system is capable of providing an adequate supply of water. 
                  (3)  When the water main is located in the street to serve the abutting lots, a water service line shall be stubbed out to the property line to serve each lot before the street is surfaced. The location of each service line shall be marked clearly on the record drawings and submitted to the governing authority. 
                  (4)  All developments shall address provisions for fire protection. For developments with municipal or community water systems, appropriate water sources, water flows and pressures must be provided for fire protection and be approved by the county's fire coordinator. For developments of more than ten (10) lots, where the minimum lot size is one (1) or more acres, and all lots are served by individual private water systems, dry hydrants or other means of fire protection shall be considered. For developments with individual water systems: 
                  a.  With ten (10) or fewer lots where the minimum lot size is one (1) or more acres; or 
                  b.  When the minimum lot size for the development is three (3) or more acres; 
                  no provision for community or central fire protection is required, but individual building protection (such as sprinkler systems) is encouraged. 
                  6.1.3.  Sanitary sewerage. Subdivisions located in any municipality, or near or adjacent to an existing municipal sanitary system, shall connect to that municipal system, unless the municipality certifies that it will not provide sanitary sewerage services. 
                  (1)  In other areas not served by municipal systems or other public systems, a community water system and a community sanitary sewerage system shall be installed in a subdivision with more than fifty (50) lots or with potential for more than fifty (50) lots. A variance from the community sanitary sewerage system requirement for subdivisions with more than fifty (50) and less than one hundred (100) lots may be granted by the governing authority if the lot sizes are one (1) acre or more, and the soil conditions are able to support the required number of on-site sewage disposal units. The variance request must be accompanied by a detailed soils report by a qualified professional attesting to the conditions of the site. For subdivisions with one hundred (100) or more lots or with potential for more than one hundred (100) lots, a variance from the requirement for a community water and sewer system may be granted by the governing authority only if the lots are five (5) acres or more, and if unique conditions meeting the requirements in article X exist, and the soil conditions are able to support the required number of on-site sewage disposal units. The variance request must be accompanied by a detailed report by a qualified soils professional and a qualified engineer attesting to the conditions of the site. If a sanitary sewerage system is installed in a subdivision, the proposed sewerage system shall be installed in accordance with the plans and specifications approved by the local governing authority's engineer, and the requirements of the environmental protection division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. 
                  (2)  Individual septic systems, if approved, shall be installed in accordance with the approved plans and specifications and in accordance with the rules and administrative regulations of the local governing authority and the county health department. 
                  (3)  Subdivisions located near or adjacent to a private sewerage system may connect to that system provided that the owner agrees to the connection in writing, that the extension is reviewed and approved as mentioned above, and that the existing system is capable of providing adequate treatment and disposal. 
                  (4)  When the sewer line is located in a street right-of-way and it will be necessary to cut into the street surface to serve the abutting lots, a connection shall be stubbed out to the property line to serve each lot prior to surfacing the street. The location of each service line shall be marked clearly on the record drawings and submitted to the governing authority. 
                  6.1.4.  Sewage disposal systems. Prior to the construction of any community sewerage disposal system such as private septic tanks, an oxidation pond or other facility, the location, size, plans, and specifications of such a facility shall be approved by and be in accordance with the rules and administrative regulations of the governing authority, the county health department, and the environmental protection division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. 
                  6.1.5.  Curbs and gutters. Concrete curbs and gutters shall be installed along new streets and roadways. Existing public roadways that are included in or are adjacent to the development or subdivision shall be developed and improved to the same curb and gutter and sidewalk standards as new streets. All concrete curbs shall be installed in accordance with the approved plans and standard specifications. All streets designated and shown shall be constructed and surfaced with the requirements of this ordinance and with the details, drawings and specifications as published by the governing authority. A copy of the standard specifications will be kept on file at the planning commission. Higher standards than those required by the standard specifications may be required by the governing authority to provide adequately for unusual soil conditions, extraordinary traffic volume or other abnormal conditions. Curbs and gutters may not be required by the governing authority when the subdivider provides for "low impact design" and/or "clustering" of development to address runoff in a way that improves the quality and reduces the quantity of runoff. Approval of the developer's plans by the reviewing engineer and the governing authority is required. 
                  6.1.6.  Street grading and surfacing (local streets). Street grading, base preparation and surfacing of local streets shall be carried out in accordance with the approved plans and specifications. Grading, base preparation, and surfacing of local collection and arterial streets shall be installed in accordance with the standard specifications. Approval of the developer's plans by the county engineer and governing authority is required. 
                  6.1.7.  Storm drainage. An adequate drainage system, including necessary open ditches, pipes, culverts, storm sewers, storm drains, drop inlets, bridges, and other necessary appurtenances shall be installed by the subdivider in accordance with the plans, standard specifications, and drainage ordinance. Approval of the developer's plans by the county engineer and governing authority is required. 
                  6.1.8.  Signs. Street name signs shall be installed at all intersections within a subdivision. Traffic control signs shall be installed in accordance with the Uniform Manual of Traffic Control Devices. The governing authority shall approve the location and design. 
                  6.1.9.  Topsoil. Topsoil shall not be removed from residential lots or used as spoil, but shall be redistributed so as to provide at least six (6) inches of cover on the lots and at least four (4) inches of cover between sidewalks and curbs, and shall be stabilized by seeding or planting. 
                  6.1.10.  Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be installed in all approved subdivisions in accordance with section 7.1.19 of this regulation. For residential subdivisions, sidewalks may be installed on individual lots at the time of home construction and made a condition of the certificate of occupancy. However, all sidewalks must be installed within twenty-four (24) months of final plat approval. 
                  6.1.11.  Nonpotable reuse water line. A nonpotable reuse water system shall be installed in all approved subdivisions and other planned developments where reuse water will be available in accordance with the plans and specifications approved by the governing authority. 
                  6.1.12.  Street lights and poles.

A street lighting plan, developed by the appropriate utility company, shall be submitted with the preliminary plat. 
                  6.1.13.  Electric and other utilities. All utilities and systems (electric, telephone, cable, etc.) shall be placed underground by the developer, and shall be installed as approved by the appropriate utility company and the governing authority. A variance from this requirement may be granted by the governing authority if unique conditions meeting the requirements in article X exist. 
                  6.1.14.  Other required improvements. Following a detailed review of the impact of the proposed subdivision or other planned developments described in article VIII on the infrastructure systems of the governing authority, other improvements, either on or off the site under development, may be required to be installed or paid for by the developer. The governing authority staff shall determine and approve the need and cost for all other required improvements and shall submit a report to the governing authority for approval. 
                  6.1.15.  Minimum corner clearance requirements for full access driveways (providing both ingress from and egress to either direction) at or near intersections. Roadway classification intersecting clearance with (in linear feet as measured from the curb return of the intersecting street to the first curb return of the driveway): 
                  Arterial to Arterial: 250*** 
                  Arterial to Collector: 125*** 
                  Arterial to Local: 50 
                  Collector to All: 50 
                  Local to All: 50 
                  Properties which do not meet the above minimum distance requirements may be approved as "right in—right out" only provided that no driveway may be located closer than fifty (50) linear feet from the curb return of the intersecting street. 
                  *** It must be proven by an engineering traffic study that left-hand-turn storage is sufficient for both the intersection and the proposed full access driveway. If more intersection clearance distance is required based on the study, then that shall be the minimum corner clearance distance. In no event shall it be less that the minimums stated herein. 

                  Sec. 6.3. - Final plat revisions. 
                  If it should become necessary to revise a final plat due to a dimensional error, a revised plat shall be submitted to the county clerk of court for final recording after the planning commission has approved and signed the revised plat. 
                  Sec. 6.4. - Installation guarantee. 
                  In lieu of requiring the completion of all required improvements prior to the acceptance of a final plat, the governing authority may, at its discretion, accept a bond or guarantee from the subdivider, whereby the subdivider shall guarantee to complete all required improvements by this appendix or otherwise specified by the county engineer or his/her designated representative, to the satisfaction of the local governing authority.

Sufficient inspections shall be made to ensure compliance with the specifications set forth in these regulations. A registered engineer, employed by the developer, shall also certify in writing to the governing authority that he has inspected each and all phases of the development and finds all construction, including, but not limited to, the installation of all drainage systems, streets, sidewalks, water, non-potable reuse water lines, and sewerage systems to be in compliance with the approved development plans, specifications and standard specifications as set forth in these regulations. 
                  Sec. 6.6. - Acceptance of improvements. 
                  At the time of final plat approval, any completed public improvements required as a condition of final plat approval may be accepted by the governing authority. Upon completion of the remaining public improvements, if any, the governing authority may accept the public improvements provided that roadway improvements deemed acceptable for public use and maintenance shall be adopted by resolution of the governing authority in accordance with O.C.G.A § 32-4-40 and recorded in the minutes of said governing authority. Each portion of these improvements must have also been inspected and approved by the engineer or his designated representative, and/or the governing authority. All primary and or secondary improvements must also have been constructed in accordance with the standard specifications. Prior to acceptance of any primary and/or secondary public improvements, the governing authority must obtain the engineer's certificate referred to in section 6.5 and a maintenance bond referred to in section 6.8. 
                  Sec. 6.7. - Building permits. 
                  No building permit in a subdivision shall be issued and no building other than a farm building shall be erected on any lot unless the street giving access to the lot upon which the building is proposed to be placed has been accepted, or shall have otherwise been approved, by the governing authority. 
                  Sec. 6.8. - Maintenance bond. 
                  A maintenance bond (warranty bond) is required for acceptance of any completed public primary and or secondary improvements. The bond shall be written in the amount of fifteen (15) percent of the construction cost of the work. The amount of the maintenance bond shall be reviewed and approved by the designated engineer as sufficient to cover maintenance. The maintenance bond shall guarantee the work for a period of one (1) year, from the date of acceptance of the improvements by the local governing authority as shown in section 6.6. 
                  During the period of the one-year guarantee, any maintenance, replacement or repair required will be the responsibility of the developer. The required improvements will be inspected by the governing authority at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the maintenance bond. Any required maintenance shall be completed prior to release of the bond. If maintenance is not completed, the bond will be forfeited to the governing authority. Upon expiration of the one-year period, the governing authority shall consider for acceptance the public primary and secondary improvements for maintenance pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 32-4-40 as may be amended from time to time. Prior acceptance by the governing authority shall not relieve the developer of responsibility for subsequent failures occurring within the period of the one-year guarantee. If at any time during the one-year period the developer fails to make prompt repairs or fails to maintain the road to the satisfaction of the governing authority, the governing authority may inform the developer and utilize bond funds or guarantee funds as needed. 
                  Sec. 6.9. - Dedications. 
                  After the adoption of a major street plan as provided by law, the county or other public authority shall not accept, lay out, open, improve, grade, pave, or light any street or authorize the laying of water mains, sewers, connections, or other facilities or utilities in any street within the territorial jurisdiction of the planning commission unless such street has been accepted or opened as, or shall otherwise have received the legal status of, a public street prior to the attachment of the planning commission's subdivision jurisdiction, or unless such street corresponds in its location and lines with a street shown on a subdivision plat approved by the planning commission and the local governing authority. The governing authority may locate and construct or may accept any other street if the ordinance or other measure for such location and construction, or for acceptance, is first submitted to the planning commission for its approval, and if disapproved by the planning commission is approved by the governing authority. A street approved by the commission upon submission, or by the governing body having appropriate jurisdiction or constructed or accepted the governing authority after disapproval by the commission, shall have the status of an approved street as though it had originally been shown on a plat approved by the planning commission or on a plat made and adopted by the planning commission.

                  7.1.3.  Access to adjacent properties. It is desirable to provide for street access to adjoining property. Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary of such property and a temporary turnaround shall be provided, unless the governing authority approves another system for access. Houses fronting on minor streets shall have access from minor streets only. Each subdivision should seek to provide at least two (2) points of access (streets) to existing public streets where feasible, and in a subdivision with, or the potential for, seventy-five (75) or more lots, two (2) or more access streets shall be provided unless the development can meet the standards for a variance as defined in article X. 
                  7.1.4.  Street names. Proposed streets, which are obviously in alignment with other existing and named streets, shall bear the assigned name of the existing streets. In no case shall the names of the proposed streets duplicate or be phonetically similar to existing street names, irrespective of the use of suffix, street, avenue, boulevard, drive, place, court, etc. It shall be unlawful for any person in laying out any new street or road to name such street or road on any plat, by marking, or in any deed or instrument, without first getting approval of the planning commission. The planning commission shall coordinate, or cause to be coordinated, with the emergency 911 department for approval of street names. 
                  7.1.5.  Minor streets. Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be discouraged.

                  8.2.1.  Intent. It is not the intent of these regulations to freeze new developments into any single type of design. It is, however, the intent of these regulations to ensure that all new developments shall contribute to the building of economically sound, sustainable and desirable areas within the community with all necessary services and facilities. The purpose of the designation of quality developments is to allow the utilization of land while ensuring that there are little or no detrimental impacts on the environment, neighboring properties, and the public safety, welfare and interest. The intent is that all quality developments far exceed the minimum standards defined and encourage innovation in development that enhances and improves public safety and welfare. 
                  8.2.2.  Authority to modify standards. In order to provide the developer with maximum flexibility in the design and character of new subdivisions and other planned developments, the planning commission is hereby authorized to recommend that the governing authority modify the standards and requirements, but not the intent of these regulations and zoning standards, in the case of a plan that exhibits unique quality growth features within a planned unit, which, in the judgment of the planning commission: 
                  (1)  Provides significant public spaces for circulation, recreation, light, air and service needs of the tract when fully developed and populated; and 
                  (2)  Which exhibits unique "quality" features in keeping with state department of community affairs principles; and 
                  (3)  Which addresses each of Liberty County's quality development guidelines; and 
                  (4)  Which provides such covenants or other legal provisions as will assure conformity to and achievement of the comprehensive development plan. 
                  Any development considered for "quality development" status shall be analyzed using these principles and the guidelines listed below. The following is a list of Liberty County's performance guidelines against which all proposed quality developments will be analyzed: 
                  (1)  Does the proposed development provide an appropriate and significant amount of uplands dedicated to open space, recreational, and other public uses that are available for the use and enjoyment of the residents and users of the development and citizens of Liberty County? 
                  (2)  Will the development as designed minimize impacts to, and preserve, wetlands and floodplains? 
                  (3)  Has the proposal minimized the impervious surfaces in order to minimize stormwater runoff, and does it include the use of measures such as low impact design or other strategies to reduce the quantity and improve the quality of all runoff? 
                  (4)  Are the connectivity of open spaces and wetlands maximized in such a way as to create and preserve habitat areas for wildlife? 
                  (5)  Does the design maximize the preservation and protection of large hardwood trees and woodlands in wetlands and uplands? 
                  (6)  Does the proposal minimize or include mitigation for impacts on Liberty County's, and the neighboring governments', infrastructure systems? 
                  The planning commission and governing authority staff shall review the proposed development in accordance with these guidelines and the principles, and may consider modification of standards and requirements should the proposed development exceed the subdivision regulations and adequately address each of these principles and guidelines. The developer or subdivider shall request that the governing authority staff consider the development for designation as a "quality development" and provide the information required by the planning commission and governing authority staff in order to evaluate the request for the designation and the modification of any standards or requirements. 
                  8.2.3.  Maintenance of spirit of regulations. Any development or subdivision approved under this section shall maintain the objectives, purposes, and intent of these regulations. To this end, the planning commission and governing authority staff may recommend modification to the standards and requirements of these regulations and the standards defined in the Liberty County Zoning Ordinance. 
                  Sec. 8.3. - Conservation subdivisions. 
                  Conservation subdivisions shall be permitted on all residential zones subject to the following provisions: 
                  8.3.1.  General regulations. 
                  (1)  Applicability of regulations. This conservation subdivision option is available as a use by right in all agricultural and single-family residential zoning districts, including A-1, AR-1, and R-1. Applicant shall comply with all other provisions of the land development code and all other applicable laws, except those that are incompatible with the provisions contained herein. 
                  (2)  Ownership of development site. The tract of land to be subdivided may be held in single and separate ownership or in multiple ownership. If held in multiple ownership, however, the site shall be developed according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility. 
                  (3)  Housing density determination. The maximum number of lots in the conservation subdivision shall be determined by either of the following two (2) methods, at the discretion of the applicant: 
                  (a)  Calculation. The maximum number of lots is determined by dividing the area of the tract of land by the minimum lot size specified in the underlying zoning. In making this calculation, the following shall not be included in the total area of the parcel: 
                  i.  Slopes over twenty-five (25) percent of at least five thousand (5,000) square feet contiguous area; 
                  ii.  The 100-year floodplain; 
                  iii.  Bodies of open water over five thousand (5,000) square feet contiguous area; and 
                  iv.  Wetlands that meet the definition of the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to the Clean Water Act. 
                  (b)  Yield plan. The maximum number of lots is based on a conventional subdivision design plan, prepared by the applicant, in which the tract of land is subdivided in a manner intended to yield the highest number of lots possible. The plan does not have to meet formal requirements for a site design plan, but the design must be capable of being constructed given site features and all applicable regulations. 
                  8.3.2.  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  Site analysis map required. Concurrent with the submission of a preliminary plat, applicant shall prepare and submit a site analysis map. The purpose of the site analysis map is to ensure that the important site features have been adequately identified prior to the creation of the site design, and that the proposed open space will meet the requirements of this article. The preliminary site plan shall include the following features: 
                  (a)  Property boundaries; 
                  (b)  All streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands and other hydrologic features;

                  (i)  Potential connections with existing greenspace and trails. 
                  (2)  Open space management plan required. An open space management plan, as described in section 8.3.3, shall be prepared and submitted prior to the issuance of a land use permit. 
                  (3)  Instrument of permanent protection required. An instrument of permanent protection, such as a conservation easement or permanent restrictive covenant and as described in section 6.28.3, shall be placed on the open space concurrent with the issuance of a land use permit. 
                  (4)  Other requirements. The applicant shall adhere to all other applicable requirements of the underlying zoning district and the subdivision regulations. 
                  8.3.3.  Open space. 
                  (1)  Definition. "Open space" is the portion of the conservation subdivision that has been set aside for permanent protection. Activities within the open space are restricted in perpetuity through the use of an approved legal instrument.

                  vi.  Existing trails that connect the tract to neighboring areas. 
                  (d)  Above-ground utility rights-of-way and small areas of impervious surface may be included within the protected open space but cannot be counted towards the forty (40) percent minimum area requirement (exception: historic structures and existing trails may be counted). Large areas of impervious surface shall be excluded from the open space. 
                  (e)  At least twenty-five (25) percent of the open space shall consist of land that is suitable for building. 
                  (f)  At least seventy-five (75) percent of the open space shall be in a contiguous tract.

The responsibility for maintaining the open space and any facilities located thereon shall be borne by the homeowner's association. 
                  ii.  A nonprofit conservation organization deemed acceptable by the governing authority. The conveyance to the nonprofit conservation organization must contain appropriate provisions for reversion in the event that the organization becomes unwilling or unable to uphold the terms of the conveyance. 
                  iii.  Public dedication of open space. The governing authority may accept the dedication of a conservation easement to the common open space, provided the common open space is accessible to the residents of the city or county and provided the county or city agrees to and has access to maintain the common open space. 
                  iv.  Individual ownership. An individual may hold fee title to the land while a nonprofit or other qualified organization holds a conservation easement governing uses of the open space.

                  ii.  Estimates the costs and staffing requirements needed for maintenance and operation of, and insurance for, the open space and outlines the means by which such funding will be obtained or provided; 
                  iii.  Provides that any changes to the plan be approved by the governing authority; and 
                  iv.  Provides for enforcement of the plan. 
                  (c)  In the event the party responsible for maintenance of the open space fails to maintain all or any portion in reasonable order and condition, the governing authority may assume responsibility for its maintenance and may enter the premises and take corrective action, including the provision of extended maintenance. The costs of such maintenance may be charged to the homeowners' association, or to the individual property owners that make up the homeowners' association, and may include administrative costs and penalties. Such costs shall become a lien on all subdivision properties. 
                  (6)  Legal instrument for permanent protection. 
                  (a)  The open space shall be protected in perpetuity by a binding legal instrument that is recorded with the deed. The instrument shall be one (1) of the following:

                  B.  A governmental entity with an interest in pursuing goals compatible with the purposes of this ordinance. If the entity accepting the easement is not the governing authority, then a third right of enforcement favoring the governing authority shall be included in the easement. 
                  ii.  A permanent restrictive covenant for conservation purposes in favor of a governmental entity. 
                  iii.  An equivalent legal tool that provides permanent protection, if approved by the governing authority. 
                  (b)  The instrument for permanent protection shall include clear restrictions on the use of the open space. These restrictions shall include all restrictions contained in this article, as well as any further restrictions the applicant chooses to place on the use of the open space. 
                  (7)  Tax assessment of open space. Once a legal instrument for permanent protection has been placed upon the open space, the Liberty County Tax Assessor may, upon request of the property owner, reassess the open space at a lower value to reflect its more limited use. If the open space is used purely for passive recreational purposes and the terms of the instrument for permanent protection effectively prohibit any type of significant economic activity, then the assessment may be at a value of zero.

                  Sec. 10.1. - Variances. 
                  When, due to a particular hardship experienced by an owner of a tract of land, such as inadequate size, shape, drainage, etc., it is impractical for a developer to comply with the interpretations of the design requirements of these regulations the planning commission shall be authorized to recommend variances to such requirements provided the intent and purpose of these regulations are not violated. Such variations, and the reasons for granting them, shall be considered for approval by and entered into the minutes of the governing authority. The conditions for granting the variance by the governing authority are as follows: 
                  (1)  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to this particular piece of property because of its size, shape or topography; and 
                  (2)  The application of the standards to this particular property would create an unnecessary hardship; and 
                  (3)  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and 
                  (4)  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of the article. 
                  Sec. 10.2. - Exceptions. 
                  In order to promote the public welfare and enhance the safety and health of the public, it may be in the best interests of the governing authority to modify or provide exceptions to certain development and design standards. The planning commission shall be authorized to consider exceptions to such requirements, provided the intent and purpose of these regulations are not violated. All exceptions, and the reasons for granting them, shall be entered into the minutes of the planning commission and also the approving governing authority. 
                  10.2.1.  Special developments. Exceptions to design standards may be considered, when due to particular and unique proposed development standards such as: equestrian developments, developments proposed to follow low impact design to improve the quality and reduce the quantity of stormwater runoff, developments which promote enhanced walkability and bicycling, and those developments which meet a majority of, or all of, the quality development guidelines in article VIII. 
                  10.2.2.  Reserved. 
                  10.2.3.  Minor subdivision exception. Minor subdivisions in the county and outside of any municipal boundaries containing not more than ten (10) residential lots or units may be granted an exception from the paving and sidewalk requirements of this article provided the following conditions are met: 
                  (1)  Minimum lot size shall be forty-three thousand five hundred sixty (43,560) square feet (one (1) acre) and the minimum lot width shall be one hundred (100) feet; and 
                  (2)  The subdivision shall be restricted from further subdivision or extension until the street is paved in accordance with the current design standards; and 
                  (3)  The future paving of any street in the subdivision will be at the abutting property owners' expense; and 
                  (4)  The length of all roads exempted under the provisions of this article are not longer than twenty-five hundred (2,500) feet including any cul-de-sac; and 
                  (5)  All streets shall be private streets and meet all requirements for a private street exception, other than paving. 
                  10.2.4.  Private street exception. Private streets may be considered as an exception by the planning commission and may be permitted by the planning commission with the approval of Liberty County if they meet all of the following conditions: 
                  (1)  Private streets shall meet the requirements of this ordinance regarding preliminary and final plat, as well as receiving all required permits and construction inspection of infrastructure. 
                  (2)  Private streets in subdivisions shall be platted and constructed according to the design standards established for public streets. 
                  (3)  All private streets and street name markers shall be maintained by the owners of the property within such subdivisions and the governing authority has no responsibility whatsoever for their maintenance and repair until and unless improved to approved street standards and dedicated and accepted by the governing authority. 
                  (4)  All lots or parcels abutting any private street subsequently sold following this exception shall include a disclosure that the street is not a public street, and the street shall be maintained by the owners of the property within such subdivisions and the governing authority has no responsibility whatsoever for their maintenance and repair until and unless improved to approved street standards and dedicated and accepted by the governing authority. 
                  (5)  A property owners' association must be created to maintain all private streets, and be filed with the clerk of superior court, and, as a minimum, shall provide for: mandatory and automatic membership in the property owners' association before any individual properties are sold; all owners to have equal access and right to use all shared private facilities; perpetual and continued maintenance of the private streets and any open space; bond instruments to ensure maintenance of streets and common areas; bond or tax liability in the case of default; the method of assessment of dues; maintenance and related costs; and restoration in the event of damage or destruction. 
                  (6)  Where this article requires or allows the presentation and maintenance of private streets and other open space through a property owners' association, and if the property owners' association fails to maintain the private streets and common property in a reasonable condition, the governing authority shall serve written notice upon the association and upon the individual property owners, setting forth the manner in which the organization has failed to maintain common open space and private streets in a reasonable condition. The notice shall include a demand that these deficiencies of maintenance are corrected within thirty (30) days of the notice. If the deficiencies are not corrected within thirty (30) days, Liberty County, in order to preserve the taxable values of the properties within the development and to prevent the common open space and private streets from becoming a public nuisance, may enter upon the common open space and private streets and maintain it for one (1) year and thereafter until the association is prepared to provide maintenance. The cost of this maintenance by Liberty County shall be assessed against the maintenance bond established and funded by the property owners' association or, if the bond has been allowed to lapse, the cost shall be assessed against all properties within the developments that have a right of enjoyment of the private streets, and shall become a lien upon the properties. 
                  (7)  A perpetual maintenance bond with Liberty County as the beneficiary as defined in paragraph 10.2.4(6) is required for the completed paving, curb and gutter, sidewalks, drainage, water and sewer facilities, and other required improvements. The bond shall be written in the amount of twenty-five (25) percent of the construction cost of the work. The amount of the maintenance bond shall be reviewed and approved by the governing authority's engineer as sufficient to cover maintenance. The bond may be released or reduced only if the governing authority accepts any or all improvements for maintenance. If at any time the property owners' association fails to make prompt repairs or fails to maintain the road and other improvements to the satisfaction of the governing authority, the governing authority may inform the association and utilize bond funds or guarantee funds as needed. 
                  (8)  Private streets shall always remain open for police, fire, ambulance, and other vehicles of all government agencies.

                  Sec. 11.5. - Maintenance of common areas and private facilities. 
                  (a)  If any development includes private facilities and common areas, a property owners' association must be created to maintain all private facilities and areas, and be filed with the clerk of superior court and, as a minimum, shall provide for: mandatory and automatic membership in the property owners' association before any individual properties are sold; all owners to have equal access and right to use all shared private facilities; perpetual and continued maintenance of the private facilities and any open space; tax liability in the case of default; the method of assessment of dues; maintenance and related costs; and restoration in the event of damage or destruction. 
                  (b)  Where this article requires or allows the preservation and maintenance of private facilities and other open space through a property owners' association, and if the property owners' association fails to maintain the common property in a reasonable condition, the governing authority shall serve written notice upon the association and upon the individual property owners, setting forth the manner in which the organization has failed to maintain common open space and private streets in a reasonable condition. The notice shall include a demand that these deficiencies of maintenance are corrected within thirty (30) days of the notice. If the deficiencies are not corrected within thirty (30) days, Liberty County, in order to preserve the taxable values of the properties within the development and to prevent the common open space and private facilities from becoming a public nuisance, may enter upon the common open space and private facilities and maintain it for one (1) year and thereafter until the association is prepared to provide maintenance. The cost of this maintenance by Liberty County shall be assessed against the properties within the developments that have a right of enjoyment of the common open space and private facilities, and shall become a lien upon the properties. 
                  Sec. 11.6. - Soil erosion and sedimentation control plan and land-disturbing activity permit. 
                  If required by the Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Ordinance, a soil erosion and sedimentation control (E. and S.) plan shall be submitted to the director of the Liberty Consolidated Planning Commission. The E. and S. plan may be submitted prior to the time of filing the development's construction or site plans. A copy of the E. and S. plan shall be submitted as a part of the filing of any construction plans or the site plans when they are required. A land-disturbing activity permit shall be obtained from the governing authority following or concurrent with receiving plan approval from the Coastal Soil and Water Conservation District. Land-disturbing activities shall not begin prior to the issuance of a land-disturbing activity permit. 
                  Sec. 11.7. - Drainage and floodplain requirements. 
                  All developments shall comply with the requirements of the drainage ordinance. The development shall consider the impacts of drainage on both the flow rates and volumes as well as the 100-year flood elevations upstream and downstream of any proposed developments. The drainage plans should ensure that no other parcels are negatively impacted by the rate, volume or flow of stormwater resulting from the development.

                  Sec. 12.4. - Erection of buildings.
