            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Suwanee, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances subsequently adopted by the Mayor and City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
This 2008 republication includes all amendatory legislation through ordinances adopted in December 2007, and was accomplished under the supervision of Lennon Akins, Editor. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Ronald K. McLaughlin, Code Attorney, and Leesa Hampton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Gregory D. Jay, City Attorney, Hardin Watkins, City Manager, and Lisa Pendley, City Clerk for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

ADOPTING ORDINANCE 
ORDINANCE OF 4-22-2008(1) 
An Ordinance Adopting and Enacting a New Code for the City of Suwanee, Georgia; Providing for the Repeal of Certain Ordinances Not Included Therein; Providing a Penalty for the Violation Thereof; Providing for the Manner of Amending Such Code; and Providing When Such Code and This Ordinance Shall Become Effective. 
Whereas, the City Council of the City of Suwanee has previously adopted that certain "Code of Ordinances, City of Suwanee, Georgia" codifying its ordinances into a unified, bound Code for the public's use; 
Whereas, the City desires to replace said Code with a new bound edition that incorporates existing ordinances and new ordinances adopted since [May 15, 2001] in one single, unified volume; 
Now Therefore, Be it Ordained and Resolved by the authority of the City Council of the City of Suwanee, a Georgia Municipal Corporation, and it is Hereby Ordained and Resolved as Follows: 
Section 1. The Code entitled "Code of Ordinances, City of Suwanee, Georgia," published by Municipal Code Corporation 2008, consisting of chapters 1 through 58, each inclusive, is hereby adopted in its entirety and shall replace that prior Code of Ordinances adopted in 2001. 
Section 2. All ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted on or before [May 15, 2001], and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein, are repealed. 
Section 3. The repeal provided for in section 2 hereof shall not be construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance that is repealed by this ordinance. 
Section 4. Unless another penalty is expressly provided, every person convicted of a violation of any provision of the Code or any ordinance, rule or regulation adopted or issued in pursuance thereof shall be punished by a fine of $1,000.00, imprisonment not exceeding six months or by both such fine and imprisonment. Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any Code section, whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the city may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief and revocation of licenses or permits. 
Section 5. Additions or amendments to the Code when passed in such form as to indicate the intention of the City Council to make the same a part of the Code shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments. 
Section 6. Ordinances adopted after April 22, 2008 that amend or refer to ordinances that have been codified in the Code shall be construed as if they amend or refer to like provision of the Code. 
Section 7. This ordinance shall become effective the date adopted herein below.

Amendments to the Charter are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended sections. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original act.

Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. 

                  ARTICLE I. - INCORPORATION AND POWERS 

                  Section 1.10. - Name.

                  (e)  Ineligibility of elected official. Except where authorized by law, neither the mayor nor any councilmember shall hold any other elective or compensated appointive office in the city or otherwise be employed by said government or any agency hereof during the term for which he or she was elected.

The office of any elected official shall be declared vacant upon such elected official qualifying, in a general primary or general election, or special primary or special election, for another state, county, or municipal office or qualifying for the House of Representatives or the Senate of the United States if the term of the office for which such official is qualifying for begins more than 30 days prior to the expiration of such official's present term of office. 
                  (g)  Penalties for violations.

                  The city council may make inquiries and investigations into the affairs of the city and the conduct of any department, office, or agency thereof and for this purpose may subpoena witnesses, administer oaths, take testimony, and require the production of evidence. Any person who fails or refuses to obey a lawful order issued in the exercise of these powers by the city council shall be punished as provided by ordinance.

Notice of such special meetings shall be served on all other members personally, or by telephone personally, at least 48 hours in advance of the meeting. Such notice to councilmembers shall not be required if the mayor and all councilmembers are present when the special meeting is called. Such notice of any special meeting may be waived by a councilmember in writing before or after such a meeting and attendance at the meeting shall also constitute a waiver of notice of any business transacted in such councilmember's presence. Only the business stated in the call may be transacted at the special meeting. 
                  Section 2.19. - Rules of procedure.

Voting on the adoption of ordinances shall be by voice vote and the vote shall be recorded in the minutes, but any member of the city council shall have the right to request a roll-call vote and such vote shall be recorded in the minutes. Except as otherwise provided in this charter, the affirmative vote of three councilmembers shall be required for the adoption of any ordinance, resolution, or motion. 
                  Section 2.21. - Ordinance form; procedures. 
                  (a)  Every proposed ordinance should be introduced in writing and in the form required for final adoption. No ordinance shall contain any subject which is not expressed in its title. The enacting clause shall be "The Mayor and Council of the City of Suwanee hereby ordain..." and every ordinance shall so begin. 
                  (b)  An ordinance may be introduced by any councilmember and be read at a regular or special meeting of the city council.

                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

Such a withdrawal shall not serve to bring any new ownership into the partnership. This section shall not prohibit transfer of stock between persons who held stock in the corporation at the time of issuance of the license nor shall it prohibit transfers of stock, which does not result in any person increasing his stock holdings to a total of ten percent or more of any class of stock. 
                  (f)  Any licensee who desires to transfer the location of an establishment licensed to sell alcoholic beverages within the city shall notify the business services director or designee prior to any transfer of location.

The city shall have the authority to approve or deny the transfer of location in the same manner that it may approve or deny issuance of a new license. Should a transfer of location be approved, with no change of ownership of the business, the license fee paid for the old location shall be applied to the new location.

                  (a)  If the business services director or designee deems it necessary to conduct an audit of the records and books of the licensee, the licensee shall be notified and an agreed upon date, time and place of the audit shall be arranged. The business services director or designee may designate the city's auditor or other designated person to perform any audit authorized in this chapter. The licensee shall cooperate with the audit or forfeit any license issued under this chapter. Failure to arrange an agreed upon date within three months of an audit request will be deemed as an uncooperative act and the licensee will forfeit any licenses issued. 
                  (b)  All licensed establishments must maintain the following records for a three-year period and make them available for audit at the licensed premises: 
                  (1)  Monthly income or operating statements. 
                  (2)  Daily sales receipts showing food sales separate from liquor, beer and wine sales. This requirement applies to retail consumption on premises licensees only.

                  (4)  Monthly state sales and use tax reports. 
                  (5)  Federal income tax return with all form 1099s. The business services director or designee can waive all or some of the requirements of this requirement if the business services director or designee finds that no such records exist and it is not financially practical based on the net income of the licensed establishment to require them to keep such records. 
                  (c)  If a licensed establishment is unable to provide the records, or does not meet the required food consumption percentage, another audit shall be performed within 90 days. If after two, or more, consecutive audits a licensed establishment is unable to provide the records, or does not meet the required food consumption percentage, the licensed establishment license will be suspended for 30 days. During the 30-day suspension period, no alcoholic beverages will be allowed on the premise.

When a license is suspended or revoked, the city shall not be required to refund any portion of the license tax to the holder of such suspended or revoked license.

The completed building or the proposed building shall comply with city ordinances, regulations of the state board of commissioners and the state. The proposed building shall also be subject to final inspection and approval by the building inspector. 
                  (b)  Each building in which the business will be located shall contain sufficient lighting so that the building itself and the premises on all sides of the building are readily visible at all times from the front of the street on which the building is located so as to reveal all of the outside premises of such building. 
                  (c)  Each applicant for an alcoholic beverage license shall attach to the application evidence of ownership of the building or proposed building or a copy of the lease if the applicant is leasing the building.

                  (a)  In locations detailed in section 6-2 for on-premise consumption.

                  (e)  The city finds that its Town Center District (as previously defined and as amended) is contemplated as the central commercial and entertainment center of the city where ample parking, infrastructure, an amphitheater, nearby residential uses, etc. is present to allow the co-existence of certain establishments that sell alcohol that otherwise may not be appropriate in other areas in the city. The city believes that this regulation will further the vitality of this area and attract additional businesses where the location in other areas may be harmful or detrimental. The city further finds that this advances a legitimate end of government and such regulations are reasonably related to these goals.

                  Sec. 6-122. - Distance requirements. 
                  (a)  A license to sell any alcoholic beverages shall not be granted to any establishment within 300 feet of a church or within 600 feet of any school building nor shall a person knowingly and intentionally sell or offer to sell such beverages within these distances. Provided, however, the requirement for minimum distance from a church or school building shall not apply to a new license for the retail sale of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises. Nothing in this subparagraph shall prohibit a grocery store licensed for the retail sale of only wine and malt beverages for consumption off the premises from selling wine or malt beverages within 100 yards of any school building, school grounds, or college campus. As used in this subparagraph, the term "grocery store" means a retail establishment which has a total retail floor space of at least 10,000 square feet of which at least 85 percent is reserved for the sale of food and other nonalcoholic items, conducts all of its sales inside the building containing its retail floor space, and meets such other criteria as may be required by the local governing authority of the county or municipality; 
                  (b)  A license to sell retail package distilled spirits, a package store, shall not be issued to any establishment within 200 feet of any residence in addition to the distance requirements set forth in this section for churches and schools. 
                  (c)  A license to sell retail package distilled spirits, a package store, shall not be issued to any establishment within 1,500 feet of another package store located either within or outside the city limits. 
                  (d)  The term "school building" referred to in this section shall apply only to state, county, city or church school buildings. It includes only those structures in which instruction is offered. The term "instruction" refers to subjects commonly taught in the schools and colleges of this state. 
                  (e)  The term "church building" referred to in this section shall mean the main structure used by any religiously affiliated organization for purposes of worship. 
                  (f)  For the purposes of this section, distance shall be measured in a straight line from front door of the structure from which alcoholic beverages are sold or offered for sale, to the front door of the building of a church, government-owned treatment center or a retail package store.

                  (h)  As to any location licensed in the future, if the distance requirements in this section are met at the time of issuance of any license, the subsequent opening and operation of a church or school within the distance prohibited in this section shall not prevent the continuance of an existing license or the renewal thereof or the issuance of a new license to any subsequent owner of such property.

                  (b)  The requirement for approval of a patio/open area type environment is that the patio/open area be enclosed by some structure providing for public ingress/egress only through the main licensed premises. The purpose of this requirement is to prevent a customer from leaving the outside sales area with an open drink without the licensee's knowledge. 
                  (c)  The height of the structure required in subsection (b) of this section shall be a minimum of three and one-half feet above ground level. It does not have to be solid nor does it have to restrict visibility into or out of the patio/open sales area. It must be permitted and approved by the city's building inspection department and the county's fire department as required by their governing regulations or codes. 
                  (d)  The only exit from this type area is to be through the licensed establishment's main premises or through an approved fire exit (not for general public use unless an emergency exists). The fire exit should be of the type that sounds an alarm so that the establishment will be alerted in the event of unauthorized use when no emergency exists. 
                  (e)  If a licensee desires a patio/open sales area inside an existing structure, plans will be reviewed and approved on an individual basis by the business services director or designee. Interior type patio/open sales areas must also meet the requirements of the city's building, development and fire codes. 
                  (f)  Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit a hotel or motel with a consumption on the premises license from making sales and allowing consumption of alcoholic beverages in ballrooms, meeting rooms, reception rooms, or patio areas of such hotel or motel provided such functions are catered in connection with a meeting, conference, convention or similar type gathering at such hotel or motel. "Patio areas," as that term is used in this subsection, do not have to conform to the standards in this section.

However, nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the carrying out of wine or malt beverages for consumption at a golf course.

                  Editor's note— Ord. of 9-18-2001, adopted Sept. 18, 2001, amended article II in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former article II, §§ 10-31—10-131, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 1059, §§ 1—32, 6-15-1993. 

                  DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

                  Sec. 10-31. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed; however, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition, otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult dance establishments, this article represents a balancing of competing interests, reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons. 
                  The City of Suwanee finds that the regulation of the location of certain adult establishments is necessary to promote and protect the public health, safety, and general welfare of the city as said establishments would not be appropriate in certain zoning classifications and adjacent to or near certain institutions. The city takes official notice of certain studies which have illustrated harmful secondary negative effects of adult establishments/sexually oriented businesses including increased crime, decreased property values, and increased blight. The city takes notice of and incorporates herein by reference as if fully set forth herein those certain studies and findings along with the public hearing of the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners on July 17, 2001. Said hearing consisted of inter alia of testimony from law enforcement personnel and economic development experts. 
                  The city incorporates herein by reference the National Law Center for Children and Families Study of thirty-two (32) communities in the United States of America and incorporates each study as if fully set forth herein. 
                  The city also recognizes the right of speech grounded in the Georgia and U.S. Constitution and the manifestation of such through adult/sexually oriented businesses and the products and services they render. In seeking to protect this right the city finds the regulations set forth herein are the least restrictive means available in balancing this right while furthering the substantial governmental interests set forth above.

                  (2)  The conduct of the parade or public assembly will not require the diversion of so great a number of city police officers to properly police the line of movement and the areas contiguous thereto as to prevent normal police protection of the city; 
                  (3)  The concentration of persons, animals, and vehicles at public assembly points of the parade or public assembly will not unduly interfere with proper fire and police protection of, or ambulance service to, areas contiguous to such public assembly areas;

                  (12)  No event is scheduled elsewhere in the city where the police resources required for that event are so great that the deployment of police services for the proposed parade or public assembly would have an immediate and adverse effect upon the welfare and safety of persons and property; and

                  Sec. 22-60. - Financial qualifications. 
                  (a)  Applicants seeking a certificate of authority to act as professional bonding entities in the city must qualify under one of the following provisions: 
                  (1)  Real property. Applicants requesting permission to sign professional bail bonds by pledging their real property as collateral must do so in agreement with the chief of police. Such individual or entity must execute a deed to secure debt in favor of the chief of police to unencumbered real property within the county. Such deed shall be conditioned to allow the chief or his authorized agent to foreclose upon the default of the applicant by failure to pay any bond forfeiture judgment, subsequent to revocation of the certificate of authority, and subsequent to the depletion of any escrow account established in agreement with the chief of police for payment of such judgments. Such real property will be appraised by a qualified appraiser agreeable to the chief of police and the applicant will maintain title insurance in force on such property. Bondsmen may write bonds against the pledged property not to exceed one-half the unencumbered value of the property excluding homestead exemption on each parcel of property pledged. Bondsmen coming under this plan must comply with the same requirements placed on individuals signing property bonds. 
                  (2)  Escrow accounts. Applicants may sign an agreement with the chief of police providing for an escrow account in a federally insured savings and loan or commercial bank located within the county. The escrow agent shall be authorized to pay the chief of police the sum of any unsatisfied fi fa presented to the escrow agent by the chief of police or his authorized agent, subsequent to entry of the judgment on the general execution docket of the county and subsequent to 30 days from the date of mailing to the individual authorized to receive process for the bonding entity. This escrow shall be ten percent of the company's bonding capacity and shall not be less than $20,000.00. Any interest generated by such an account must revert to the applicant since the chief of police or the city is not authorized under state law to receive such interest. Escrow accounts will remain open until all bonds signed by the bonding entity under such an agreement are satisfied. 
                  (3)  Insurance companies. Applicants wishing to write bail bonds under the requirements of O.C.G.A. Title 33 provisions, must be approved and be currently certified by the state insurance commissioner. A copy of such certificate shall be provided with the application. The applicant's insurance company must be approved by the insurance commissioner and meet all requirements of O.C.G.A. Title 33, to do business in the state. Agents of such companies will provide copies of their current individual certificate of authorization to the bonding administrator appointed by the chief of police. Insurance companies will not at any time exceed a 3:1 net written premium to policy holder surplus ratio or it must collateralize any further bonds. Net written premiums will be defined as the company's gross writings less those writings reinsured. "Policy holder surplus" is defined as what is left out of admitted assets once all liabilities have been satisfied. O.C.G.A. § 33-3-17(6) requires payment of any final judgments within 30 days and failure to do so may also result in further action under O.C.G.A. § 33-3-20.

                  (a)  Financial. Individuals or legal entities applying for a certificate of authority shall submit copies of annual financial statements (or income tax returns, if an individual) as of December 31 for the last two years preceding the date of the application and shall submit annual financial statements on or before April 15 of the year just prior. Periodic reports will be submitted on a monthly basis and are due by the 15th of the month following the applicable month, i.e. April 15 for the month of March. These statements shall be sworn to by the corporate officers or the individual, if such is the case, submitting such statements, be sworn to and manually signed or may be signed by a certified public accountant. Periodic reports shall include a list of all bonds in force as of the date of the report and the current status of each obligation. 
                  (b)  Change of information. There shall be a continuous duty on all bonding companies and individuals to update their plan which must comply with the same requirements placed on individuals signing property bonds. 
                  (c)  Court documentation. Copies of any documentation filed that affects the status of bond obligations currently outstanding will be provided to the chief of police or the city clerk in a timely and appropriate manner. 
                  (d)  Police and procedure complaints. Problems of a policy or procedure nature will be brought to the attention of the chief of police or the city clerk for resolution. Areas that cannot be addressed on an informal basis will be submitted in writing.

                  Sec. 22-62. - Procedures. 
                  (a)  Each bondsman must be licensed by the state department of insurance. Any temporary status or licensing must be approved by the city attorney's office. 
                  (b)  A bondsman must not solicit business in or around the jail office or where prisoners are confined. If while at the jail on business a bondsman is asked if he is a bondsman, he may answer in the affirmative and conduct business in the normal manner. The initiative must be on the part of the inmate or the public. 
                  (c)  All bondsmen must sign the sign-in book when entering the jail for the purpose of doing business as a bondsman. 
                  (d)  When called to come to the jail to write a bond, it is recommended that bondsmen call the jail and advise them they are coming, name of the inmate and his estimated time of arrival. This should preclude the problem of several bondsmen responding to the same call. The jail staff have been instructed to advise the second bondsman calling for the same inmate of the previous call, thereby eliminating unnecessary response to the jail. 
                  (e)  All bondsmen using insurance companies will provide a serialized power of attorney from the surety stating the limits of liability. A power of attorney must be provided with every bond written. These powers of attorney must be serialized and state a value covering the amount of the bond to be written. 
                  (f)  All bonding companies must provide a monthly statement to the chief of police by the 15th of the month with the name of each defendant actively on bond, the amount of the bonds, the number of the power of attorney, the date the bond was made and the current status of each bond. 
                  (g)  No bondsman may pay a fee, come to any arrangement with or give anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any employee that works for the city without specific written permission of the mayor and city council. 
                  (h)  An insurer terminating the appointment of a bondsman shall file a written notice of termination with the chief of police. This notice shall state the reasons, if any, for termination. 
                  (i)  Each bondsman shall charge a fee no more or less than that specified by state statutes. No professional bondsman, his agents or his employees who receive compensation for becoming the surety on a criminal bond shall thereafter receive any other sum in the case. If, before final disposition of the case, the surety surrenders the defendant who is the principal on the bond into the custody of the court, he must first return to the principal the compensation received for signing the bond as surety. 
                  (j)  Professional bondsmen, their agents or employees shall not advise defendants, principals in bonds signed by them, or give any directions in the defense or disposition of the cases in which bonds are signed. 
                  (k)  When a fi fa is issued, the bonding companies will be given 30 days before levy process is implemented against escrow accounts. If, at the end of 30 days the fi fa has not been satisfied, bonding privileges will be suspended. Suspension of bonding privileges for this reason is administrative and not punitive. The state insurance commission will be notified for whatever actions it deems necessary in the case of insurance companies. 
                  (l)  Any violation of these procedures may result in the suspension of privileges pending an investigation of the violation. If, after an investigation the violation is substantiated, revocation of future privileges may result. If it is found that the violation did not occur as alleged or suspected, the suspension will be lifted. Any allegations of procedure violations must be submitted in writing to the chief of police for consideration. 
                  (m)  A copy of these procedures will be incorporated into and maintained within the detention services policy and procedures manual: 
                  (1)  If a person has no other way to post bond and must hire a professional bondsman, it is his responsibility to choose a bonding company. It is also his responsibility to contact the bonding company he has chosen. No employee is allowed to contact any bondsman or bonding company on behalf of anyone under arrest, even if the person under arrest should request the employee to do so. 
                  (2)  Under no circumstances is an employee allowed to recommend a bondsman or bonding company. 
                  (3)  If a bondsman calls and wishes to be notified when a certain person is brought in, the request shall be refused. 
                  (4)  No employee on duty, engaged in accepting bonds, should converse with a bondsman any more than is necessary to complete the transaction at hand. 
                  (5)  After signing the bond, the bondsman must leave the jail property unless the bondsman has legitimate business with someone else in the department who is not on duty to accept bonds. 
                  (6)  No bondsman will be allowed to enter the book-in area without specific approval of the shift supervisor or his superior. 
                  (7)  No bondsman will be allowed to view any records, receipts or files unless they pertain to his immediate client and such information is deemed necessary by a shift supervisor or his superior. 
                  (8)  No bondsman will be allowed to leave business cards, memo pads or other forms of advertisement around the jail. Bonding company signs will be rotated once a week in an orderly fashion. 
                  (9)  No employee shall give special consideration to any one particular bonding company. An employee shall remain impartial at all times.

                  Pawnshop means any business wherein a substantial part thereof is to take or receive, by way of pledge, pawn, consignment or exchange, any goods, wares, merchandise, or any kind of personal property whatever, as security for the repayment of money lent thereon.

                  Sec. 22-251. - Annual permit required. 
                  All persons before beginning the business of operating a pawnshop or similar place where money is advanced on goods or other effects, or merchandise of any kind is taken in pawn, shall first file an application with the city police department for an annual permit to conduct such business. The issuance of such permit will be based on a criminal history background investigation of the applicant. The cost of the permit/criminal history background investigation shall be $100.00, or a fee established by the city council. This fee is imposed to cover investigative expenses and/or administrative costs associated with issuing an initial permit for all owners. In the event an owner has more than one pawnshop, then each location will be assessed the above fee. This fee is nonrefundable in the event an applicant, for any reason, is not issued a permit and/or an occupational tax certificate. Owners are required to renew the permit upon expiration thereof and shall be required to pay a renewal fee established by the city council.

                  Sec. 22-253. - Application for permit. 
                  The application for the annual permit required by section 22-253 shall state the street number and address at which the business is proposed to be operated. The application shall contain the full name, address, phone number, date of birth, photograph, and Social Security Number of all persons, including pawnbrokers and employees, having any interest in the proposed business, plus any additional information, including fingerprints, deemed necessary by the finance department and/or the city police department. 
                  (Ord. of 2-23-2010, Att. A) 
                  Sec. 22-254. - Regulation as to employees and managers. 
                  (a)  No person shall be employed by a pawnshop in any capacity until such person is found to be in compliance with the qualifications as described in this section and has paid a fee which shall be established by the city council. Upon complying with the requirements of this chapter, a certificate authorizing such person to be a pawnshop employee will be issued. Each employee and/or manager will be required to renew the certificate annually. The certificate and occupation tax certificate will expire annually, on the date established generally for expiration of the occupation tax certificate. All persons having any interest in the proposed business including each owner, employee, manager, and pawnbroker shall while on the pawnshop premises, have in their possession and available for inspection such certificate. It shall be the duty of the pawnbroker to insure compliance with the provisions of this section. Certificates shall be prominently displayed on the premises in plain view. The cost of the certificate/criminal history background investigation shall be $100.00, or a fee established by the city council. This fee is imposed to cover investigative expenses and/or administrative costs associated with issuing a certificate to the respective employee. 
                  (b)  The following qualifications shall apply to all employees and managers: 
                  (1)  No certificate shall be issued until such time as a signed application has been filed with the city police department, chief of police or his designee and a search of the criminal record of the person completed. Such application shall include the applicant's name, fingerprints, Social Security Number, date of birth, and prior arrest record; though an applicant's arrest record shall be used for investigative purposes only and shall not give rise to a presumption or inference of guilt. Applicant must also provide positive identification (only official government issued pictured identification accepted, e.g. driver's license, passport, military card, or state identification card). 
                  (2)  The chief of police or his designee shall conduct a complete and exhaustive search relative to any police record of the applicant. 
                  (3)  In the event the applicant is qualified for employment in a pawnshop under this section and there is no record of a violation of this chapter, the chief of police or his designee shall issue a certificate to the applicant, by mail, stating that the person is eligible for employment. If it is found that the person is not qualified for a certificate and therefore ineligible for employment in a pawnshop, the chief of police or his designee shall notify the person in writing, that they are not eligible for employment, the cause of such denial and their right to appeal. 
                  (4)  No person who has been convicted or pled guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling, or any felonies, or any crime involving theft or fraudulent practices shall be issued a certificate for the five years preceding the date of application. For purposes of this chapter, a conviction or plea of guilt or nolo contendere entered under the Georgia First Offender Act, O.C.G.A. § 42-8-60 et seq., shall be ignored. Provided, however, that any such offense shall not be ignored where the defendant violated any term of probation imposed by the court granting first offender status or committed another crime and the sentencing court entered an adjudication of guilt as to the crime for which the defendant had previously been sentenced as a first offender. 
                  (5)  No person shall be issued a certificate if it is determined that the person falsified, concealed, or misrepresented any material fact by any device, trick, or scheme while making application to the police department for a pawnshop certificate under this section. 
                  (6)  All certificates issued through administrative error can be terminated and seized by the chief of police or his designee or the finance department or designee. 
                  (7)  Replacement certificates will be issued within 30 days of original date, upon paying one-half of the fee charged for pawnshop certificates. After 30 days of original application date, a new application and fee must be submitted. 
                  (8)  All certificates issued hereunder remain the property of the city police department, and shall be produced for inspection upon the demand of any officer or designee of the city police department or employee of the licensing and revenue department. 
                  (9)  No pawnshop owner shall allow any employee or manager to work on the premises unless the employee or manager has in their possession a current valid city certificate. For new employees, a receipt issued by the city police certificate unit may be used for a maximum of 30 days from the date of issue. Pawnshop owners are required by this chapter to inspect and verify that each employee or manager has in their possession a valid current pawnshop certificate. Issuance of this fee receipt shall allow the applicant to work in the position applied for only until such time as the required criminal history background investigation is completed. The temporary privilege conferred by issuance of this fee receipt shall expire immediately upon completion of such background investigation. If the background investigation indicates that the applicant does not meet the requirements for issuance of a pawnshop certificate, the applicant may appeal the denial of the certificate as provided in this chapter. However, issuance of this fee receipt and the temporary privilege granted thereby shall not be construed as conferring any right or privilege to the applicant to continue working in the position for which the certificate sought during the pendency of the appeal from the denial of a certificate under this chapter. 
                  (10)  It shall be the duty of all persons holding a pawnshop occupation tax certificate to file with the chief of police or his designee, the name of the establishment, the occupation tax certificate number and a list of all employees, including their date of birth, Social Security Number, home address and home telephone numbers twice annually; during the month of June and again during the month of December. 
                  (11)  If it is determined that any person issued a pawnshop certificate has falsified, concealed, or misrepresented any material fact by any device, trick, or scheme in the application for the pawnshop certificate such certificate shall be revoked or canceled. 
                  (12)  City employees who are directly involved in the issuance of pawnshop certificates or in the regulation of pawnshops shall not be eligible for a certificate.

Any applicant who is aggrieved or adversely affected by a final action of the chief of police may have a review thereof by appeal to the zoning board of appeals. 
                  Such appeal shall be by written petition, filed in the office of the finance department within 15 days after the final order or action of the chief of police and in order to defray administrative costs, must be accompanied by a filing fee of $100.00. The finance department, at its discretion, may waive or reduce the filing fee amount if it is determined the fee would create a hardship on the individual filing such appeal. The zoning board of appeals, at the request of the appellant, may refund the filing fee by a majority vote. 
                  (2)  A hearing shall be conducted on each appeal within 30 days of the date of filing with the finance department unless a continuance of such date is agreed to by the appellant and the city. The appellant at such hearing shall have the right to be represented by an attorney, at the expense of the appellant, and to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

                  (4)  The findings of the appeals board shall not be set aside unless found to be:

                  (a)  Insofar as practicable, sound will be measured while the source under investigation is operating at normal, routine conditions. 
                  (b)  All tests shall be conducted in accordance with the following procedures: 
                  (1)  The noise investigator shall, to the extent practicable, identify all sources contributing sound to the point of measurement. 
                  (2)  Measurements shall be taken at or within the property line of the affected person, except when the affected party is in a multiunit residential building. In such a case the sound level is measured from any point inside the affected unit. 
                  (3)  The measuring instrument must be calibrated using a calibrator recommended by the measuring instrument manufacturer before and after each series of readings. 
                  (4)  No outdoor measurements shall be taken: 
                  a.  When wind speeds (including gusts) exceed 15 mph; 
                  b.  Without a windscreen, recommended by the measuring instrument manufacturer, properly attached to the measuring instrument; 
                  c.  Under any condition that allows the measuring instrument to become wet (e.g., rain, snow, or condensation); or 
                  d.  When the ambient temperature is out of the range of the tolerance of the measuring instrument. 
                  (c)  Prior to taking noise measurements the noise investigator shall explore the vicinity of the source in question to identify any other sound sources that could affect measurements, to establish the approximate location and character of the principal sound source, and to select suitable locations from which to measure the sound from the source in question. 
                  (d)  When measuring continuous sound, or sound that is sustained for more than one second at a time, the measuring instrument shall be set for A-weighting, slow response, and the range (if the measuring instrument is designed to read levels over different ranges) shall be set to that range in which the meter reads closest to the middle of the scale. The minimum and maximum readings shall be recorded to indicate the range of monitored values along with the central tendency average most often displayed. 
                  (e)  The measuring instrument shall be placed at a minimum height of three feet above the ground or from any reflective surface. When handheld, the microphone shall be held at arm's length and pointed at the source at the angle recommended by the measuring instruments manufacturer. 
                  (f)  If extraneous sound sources, such as aircraft flyovers or barking dogs, that are unrelated to the measurements increase the monitored sound levels, the measurements should be postponed until these extraneous sounds have become of such a level as not to increase the monitored sound levels of interest. 
                  (g)  The monitoring session should last for a period of time sufficient to ensure that the sound levels measured are typical of the source in question.

As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6 subsection (b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs.

                  (5)  The local issuing authority may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in (c) (15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 34-209 (b) (2) of this article; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25 foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the city and the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specification and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (17)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to Code Section 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to Code Section 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land- disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the Division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing Authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in section 34-209(b) and (c) of this article. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

                  Sec. 34-220. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Suwanee without first obtaining a permit from the City to perform such activity and providing a copy of the notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the City and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 34-220(c) of this article. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 34-209(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by two copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-. 10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection (a) of O.C.G.A 12-7-8 half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the Division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 34-209 (c) (15), (16) and (17) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per section 34-220 (b) (6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 34-209(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and the seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 34-209 (c)(15), (16) and (17) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per section 34-220 (b) (6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. 12-7-7(f)(1).

                  (a)  The City of Suwanee Inspection Division will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting the land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the tertiary permitee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975.

                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8 (a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to Code section 12-7-8 (a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8 (a) has not administered or enforced its ordinance or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-7 (e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  Sec. 34-303. - Findings. 
                  It is hereby determined that: 
                  (1)  The city separate storm sewer system was designed and installed to manage stormwater so as to prevent localized flooding, damage to property and risk to public safety; 
                  (2)  The city separate storm sewer system was not designed or installed as a receiving system for nonstormwater discharges; 
                  (3)  Discharges to the city separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
                  (4)  These nonstormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the city separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments; 
                  (5)  These nonstormwater discharges not only impact local waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume nonstormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters; 
                  (6)  The impacts of these nonstormwater discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
                  (7)  These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the city separate storm sewer system; 
                  (8)  Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of nonpoint source pollution caused by nonstormwater discharges to the city separate storm sewer system; 
                  (9)  The Clean Water Act requires the management and maintenance of the city separate storm sewer system and the management of discharges to that system; 
                  (10)  Therefore, in order to prohibit such nonstormwater discharges to the city separate storm sewer system, it is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the city separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.

                  Sec. 34-304. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare through the regulation of nonstormwater discharges to the city separate storm sewer system to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal law. This article establishes methods for controlling the introduction of nonstormwater discharges into the city separate storm sewer system in order to comply with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. The objectives of this article are to: 
                  (1)  Comply with all Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) stormwater regulations developed pursuant to the Clean Water Act; 
                  (2)  Prohibit illicit discharges and illegal connections to the city separate storm sewer system; 
                  (3)  Prevent nonstormwater discharges, generated as a result of spills, inappropriate dumping or disposal, to the city separate storm sewer system; and 
                  (4)  To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance, monitoring and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this article.

                  (a)  The director or his designee may grant a variance from the requirements of this article if exceptional circumstances applicable to a site or premises exist such that strict adherence to the provisions of the ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship and will not fulfill the intent of the ordinance. Specifically, such variances may be granted in such individual cases of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the director or his designee that: 
                  (1)  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular site in question; 
                  (2)  The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the impact on upstream and downstream properties; 
                  (3)  The application of the ordinance to this particular site would create an unnecessary hardship; 
                  (4)  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular site involved; 
                  (5)  Such conditions are not the result of any actions of the site owner; 
                  (6)  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good nor impair the purposes or intent of this article; and 
                  (7)  No variance may be granted for a site for any discharge that is prohibited by this article or which would result in a deterioration of quality of stormwater from a site greater than would otherwise be allowed if no variance were involved. 
                  (b)  A written request for a variance shall be required and shall state the specific variance sought and the reasons, with supporting data, that a variance should be granted. The request shall include all information necessary to evaluate the proposed variance. 
                  (c)  The director or his designee will conduct a review of the request for a variance within 30 working days of receiving the request.

                  Site means the parcel of land being developed, or the portion thereof on which the development project is located. 
                  Start of construction includes substantial improvement, and means the date the permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of the structure on a site such as the pouring of slabs or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building (including a gas or liquid storage tank), that is principally above ground, or a manufactured home.

                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it's before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. This term also includes repetitive loss. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement to a structure taking place during a ten-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of the building means (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been identified by the City of Suwanee Building Official or Code Enforcement Officer. The term does also not include any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the requirements of this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in 15.80.040(E(2)) below; 
                  (2)  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment will not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A licensed professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and, 
                  (3)  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the City of Suwanee Planning and Inspections Director until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA or a no-rise certification is approved by the City of Suwanee Planning and Inspections Director.

                  ARTICLE IV. - REGULATION OF GRAFFITI 

                  Sec. 42-91. - Definitions. 
                  Graffiti means the unauthorized inscription, defacing, damaging or destroying by spraying of paint or marking or engraving of ink, chalk, dye or other similar substances, or by carving or scratching on public or private buildings, structures, places and properties. 
                  Graffiti abatement means the abatement procedure that identifies graffiti, issues notices to the landowner to abate the graffiti, and cures or removes such graffiti in absence of a response. 
                  Private contractor means any person with whom the city shall have contracted to remove graffiti. 
                  (Ord. of 7-25-05, § I) 
                  Sec. 42-92. - Findings; nuisance. 
                  The city council finds that graffiti is a public nuisance and destructive of the rights and values of property owners as well as the entire community. Unless the city acts quickly to remove graffiti from public and private property, the graffiti tends to remain. Other properties then become the target of graffiti, and entire neighborhoods are affected and become less desirable places in which to be, all to the detriment of the city. Further, the city finds that rapid or prompt removal (e.g. 24 to 48 hours) serves as a deterrent to future defacement and such defacement is less likely to reappear. 
                  Graffiti and other defacement of public and private property, including walls, rocks, bridges, buildings, fences, gates, signage, and other structures, trees, and other real and personal property within the city constitutes a nuisance. 
                  (Ord. of 7-25-05, § II) 
                  Sec. 42-93. - Prohibited. 
                  It shall be a violation of this chapter for any person to write, paint or draw, carve or scratch upon any wall, rock, bridge, building, fence, gate, signage and other structure, trees, and other real or personal property, either publicly or privately owned, any drawing, inscription, figure or mark of the type which is commonly known and referred to as "graffiti", to the extent the graffiti was not authorized in advance by the owner or occupant of the property, or, despite advance authorization, is otherwise deemed a public nuisance by the city. 
                  (Ord. of 7-25-05, § III) 
                  Sec. 42-94. - Violation. 
                  A violation of any of the provisions of this section shall be punishable by either fine and/or incarceration in an amount and length not to exceed state law or as otherwise set forth in the City of Suwanee Code of Ordinances. Nothing herein shall prevent the additional remedy of restitution if appropriate. 
                  (Ord. of 7-25-05, § IV) 
                  Sec. 42-95. - Notice of removal. 
                  (a)  Whenever the city's code enforcement officer or police officer, or his/her designee, determines that graffiti exists on any public or private buildings, structures, and places which are visible to any persons utilizing any public road, parkway, alley, sidewalk or other right of way within the city and when weather conditions permit the painting of exterior surfaces, the city manager or his designee shall cause a notice to be issued to abate such nuisance. The property owner shall have two business days after the date of the notice to remove the graffiti or the same will be subject to abatement by the city. 
                  (b)  This notice to abate graffiti pursuant to this section shall be a written notice to be served upon the owner(s) of the affected premises, as such owner(s) name and address appears on the last property tax assessment rolls of Gwinnett County, Georgia. If there is no known address for the owner, the notice shall be sent in care of the property address. The notice required by this section may be served in any one of the following manners: 
                  (1)  By personal service on the owner, occupant or manager of the property; or 
                  (2)  By registered or certified mail addressed to the owner at the last known address of said owner. If this address is unknown, the notice will be sent to the property address. 
                  (Ord. of 7-25-05, § V) 
                  Sec. 42-96. - City costs enforceable as a lien. 
                  Any and all costs incurred by the city in the abatement of the graffiti nuisance as provided in this chapter shall constitute a debt owed to the city by the property owner and shall be enforceable as a lien against the property which such nuisance existed, in addition to the other legal remedies available for enforcement of debts. Any abatement procedure shall be in accordance with the City of Suwanee Code of Ordinances. 
                  (Ord. of 7-25-05, § VI) 
                  Sec. 42-97. - Removal by city. 
                  Upon failure of persons to comply with the notice by the designated date, or such continued date thereafter as set forth by the city's officer, then the graffiti may be abated by the city or by private contractor, and the city or its private contractor is expressly authorized to enter the premises for such purposes during regular business hours or at times mutually agreeable with the property owner or occupant. All reasonable efforts to minimize damage from such entry shall be taken by the city. If the city provides for the removal of the graffiti, it shall not authorize or undertake to provide for the painting or repair of any more extensive area than the area where the graffiti is located. When graffiti is painted over, the city or its private contractor shall attempt to match the paint with the underlying color of the defected surface. Property owners in the City of Suwanee may consent in advance to the city entry onto private property for graffiti removal purposes but such consent is not mandatory. 
                  (Ord. of 7-25-05, § VII) 
                  Sec. 42-98. - Severability. 
                  Should any section, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this chapter, or its application to any person or circumstances, be declared unconstitutional or otherwise invalid for any reason, or should any portion of this chapter be pre-empted by state or federal law or regulation, such decision or pre-emption shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this chapter or its application to other provisions or circumstances. 
                  (Ord. of 7-25-05, § VIII) 
                  Sec. 42-99. - Provisions not mandatory. 
                  It is the specific intent of this chapter that neither provision nor any term used in this chapter is intended to impose any duty whatsoever upon the city or any of its officers or employees, for whom the implementation and enforcement of this chapter shall be discretionary and not mandatory. 
                  Nothing in this chapter is intended nor shall be construed to create or form the basis of any liability on the part of the city, or its officers, employees, or agents, for any injury or damage resulting from any action or inaction on the part of the city related in any manner to the enforcement of this chapter by its officers, employees, or agents.

                  Sec. 46-31. - Objectives and findings. 
                  In an effort to maintain high quality, long-lasting and sustainable development within the city, the city adopts the following design guidelines and standards for all newly constructed buildings within RM-6, RM-8, C-1, C-2, C-3, O-I and M-1 zoning districts. These guidelines are intended to enhance the visual aspect and livability of the entire city. They are intended to encourage an old-town look and feel of historical state villages. These guidelines will foster architectural diversity and interest yet achieve and maintain a consistent, durable and pleasing aesthetic/visual quality. The use of a common palate of building materials should be maintained for all building facades to create a consistent and traditional architectural identity. Traditional architecture includes the use of red brick, pitched roofs, low-profile signage and subdued colors. For large commercial/retail buildings, variations in facade, roofline and depth should be provided to lend the appearance of multi-tenant occupancy.

                  Table II—Allowed Building Materials—Industrial/Warehouse/Distribution Uses over 30,000 square feet Gross Floor Area (GFA) 

                   
                  Notes: 
                  *  Allowed only on rear facades of buildings larger than 10,000 square feet gross floor area. When allowed it must be tinted or painted to blend with the balance of the building. 
                  @  For industrial/warehouse buildings less than 30,000 square feet gross floor area. 
                  #  Allowed for buildings intended to have a residential appearance. Building must have a minimum 4:12 roof pitch. 
                  (3)  Accent/trim exterior building material. Small amounts of building materials such as wood, tile, etc., may be used to enhance the elevation of the building or for decorative elements but should not exceed ten percent of the total wall area per facade. 
                  (4)  Facade calculations. With the exception of accent/trim materials there shall be no more than two primary building materials used. When a material is restricted as a percentage in Table I or Table II, such as stucco, siding, etc., the building material may not be combined with another restricted building material. The allowed facade materials shall not apply to windows, glass-front windows, entry doors and/or roll-up doors. The amount of permitted material shall be calculated using the gross square footage of wall area per facade. A building material that is allowed, such as brick, may be used in any percentage throughout the structure. A material that is restricted, such as stucco, is allowed as a maximum percentage. For example, if a building has a front facade with a gross facade area of 1,200 square feet with 400 square feet consisting of windows and doors, begin with 1,200 square feet for required building material calculations. In this case, the front facade of a building in the C-2 zoning district with a wall area of 1,200 square feet shall have no more than 300 square feet of stucco on the front facade (example: 1,200 × 25% = 300). The balance shall be brick or another allowed material.

                  ARTICLE III. - CHATTAHOOCHEE RIVER WATERSHED PROTECTION 

                  Sec. 46-71. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted development. Land disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation which threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxicants, nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies. 
                  (b)  The city has determined that land inside the city lies within the Chattahoochee River water supply watershed. This watershed is greater than 100 square miles in size and is categorized as a large water supply watershed under the provisions of this article. As of the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived, no portion of the city lies within seven miles upstream of an active water supply intake or water supply reservoir.

                  ARTICLE V. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREA PROTECTION 

                  Sec. 46-156. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. Therefore, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that the city and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water. Groundwater resources are contained within aquifers which are permeable rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. 
                  (b)  Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. Therefore, it is necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized. 
                  (c)  According to available data provided by the state department of natural resources, the city contains significant groundwater recharge areas. According to the state groundwater pollution susceptibility map, the city is within an area having a low susceptibility rating (drastic rating less than 141).

                  Sec. 46-157. - Objectives. 
                  The objectives of this article are to: 
                  (1)  Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas; 
                  (2)  Protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development; and 
                  (3)  Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality.

                  Sec. 46-159. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Aquifer means any stratum (rock layer) or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well. 
                  Groundwater recharge area means an area of the Earth's surface where water infiltrates the ground thereby replenishing the groundwater supplies within an aquifer. 
                  Hazardous material/waste means any substance defined as hazardous waste by the state department of natural resources pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-8-60 et seq., as amended. 
                  Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of groundwater to pollution from chemical spills, leaching of pollutants from dump sites, animal waste from agricultural operations or pollution generated by other human activities. 
                  Pollution susceptibility maps means maps prepared by the state department of natural resources that show the relative susceptibility of groundwater to pollution. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas of high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential. 
                  Significant groundwater recharge areas means areas mapped by the state department of natural resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 edition. Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology (chemical nature and form of the rock), soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts, geologic structure, presence of karst topography (sinkholes, caves and fissures associated with limestone and other carbonate rocks) and potentiometric surfaces.

                  Sec. 46-172. - Utility registration. 
                  (a)  Registration required. Each utility who occupies, uses or has facilities in the rights-of-way at the time of passage of this article, including by lease, sublease or assignment, to operate facilities located in the rights-of-way, unless specifically exempted by state or federal law or this Code, shall file a registration statement with the department of planning within 90 days of the effective date of this article. 
                  (b)  Registration procedure. The registration information provided to the city shall be on a form approved by the city and include, but not be limited to: 
                  (1)  The name, legal status (i.e. partnership, corporation, etc.), street address, email address, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the utility filing the registration statement (the "registrant"). If the registrant is not the owner of the facility in the right-of-way, the registration shall include the name,, street address, email address if applicable, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the owner; 
                  (2)  The name, street address, email address if applicable and telephone and facsimile numbers of one or more facilities representative(s). Current information regarding how to contact the facilities Representative(s) in an emergency shall be provided at the time of filing a registration and shall be updated as necessary to assure accurate contact information is available to the city at all times;

                  (c)  Incomplete registration. If a registration is incomplete, the city shall notify the registrant and shall provide a reasonable period of time in which to complete the registration. If a registration is complete, the director shall so notify the utility in writing. 
                  (d)  Acceptance of the registration shall not convey title in the rights-of-way. Acceptance of the registration is only the nonexclusive, limited right to occupy rights-of-way in the city for the limited purposes stated in the acceptance. Acceptance of the registration does not excuse a utility from obtaining permits required by city ordinances nor from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before using the facilities of others, including the city. Acceptance of the registration does not excuse a Utility from notifying the city of construction as required herein. 
                  (e)  Facilities in place without registration. Beginning one year after the effective date of this chapter, any facilities or part of a facility found in a right-of-way for which registration is required but has not been obtained unless specifically exempted by law, and for which no valid service agreement exists with the city, may be deemed to be a nuisance and an unauthorized use of the rights-of-way. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to abating the nuisance; taking possession of the facilities, evicting the utility from the right-of-way; prosecuting the violator; and/or any other remedy provided by city ordinance or otherwise allowed in law or in equity.

It shall be unlawful for any utility to excavate or to construct, install, maintain, renew, remove or relocate facilities in, on, along, over or under the public roads of the city without a utility permit from the department of planning and inspections in accordance with the terms of this chapter. 
                  (b)  Permit procedure. Utility permits shall be obtained from the city upon application made on forms prescribed by the planning and inspections department. The written application shall include the following: 
                  (1)  The name and address of the utility; 
                  (2)  The nature, extent, and location of any work proposed to be done, along with satisfactory plans as attachments showing in detail the location of the proposed facility or operations as described in the permit application. The plans shall show the size or capacity of facilities to be installed; their relationship to street features such as right-of-way lines, pavement edge, structures, etc., horizontal and vertical clearance to critical elements of the roadway and any other information necessary to evaluate the impact on the street and its operation; 
                  (3)  The name and address of the person or firm who is to do such work; 
                  (4)  The name, street address, email address if applicable and telephone and facsimile numbers of one or more facilities representative(s).

                  (7)  A copy, if requested, of the registrant's certificate of authority (or other acceptable evidence of authority to operate) from the Georgia Public Service Commission and/or the FCC and any other similar approvals, permits, or agreements; and 
                  (8)  A copy, if requested, of the service agreement, if applicable or other legal instrument that authorizes the utility to use or occupy the right-of-way for the purpose described in the application. 
                  (c)  Permit fees. Fees shall be determined by the director, subject to the approval by resolution of the city council. A fee schedule shall be available at the offices of the director and the city clerk and open for public inspection. 
                  (d)  Issuance of permit. If the city determines the applicant has satisfied the following requirements, a permit may be issued. 
                  (1)  Whether issuing of the permit will be consistent with this chapter; and 
                  (2)  Whether the applicant has submitted a complete application and has secured all certificates and other authorizations required by law, if applicable, in order to construct facilities in the manner proposed by the applicant; and 
                  (3)  Whether the applicant has adequately addressed project impacts on safety, visual quality of the streets, traffic flow, other users of the right-of-way, project duration, project timing, and other issues related to construction and maintenance. 
                  (e)  Emergency situations. 
                  (1)  Each utility shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, notify the city of any event regarding its facilities which it considers to be an emergency. The utility may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary in order to respond to the emergency. A utility who engages in an emergency excavation shall take all reasonable precautions to avoid or minimize damage to any existing facilities. 
                  (2)  In the event that the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding utility facilities, the city may attempt to contact the affected utility or facilities representative. The city may take whatever action it deems necessary in order to respond to the emergency, including cut or move any of the wires, cables, amplifiers, appliances, or other parts of the facilities. The city shall not incur any liability to the utility, for such emergency actions, and the cost of such shall be paid by each utility affected by the emergency. 
                  (f)  Effective period of permit. 
                  (1)  Each permit shall have a set commencement and expiration date based on information provided in the applicant's permit application. 
                  (2)  The permit shall remain in place until construction is completed or until its expiration date unless the utility is in default. The city may give written notice of default to a utility if it is determined that a utility has: 
                  a.  Violated any provision or requirement of the issuance or acceptance of a permit application or any law of the city, state, or federal government; 
                  b.  Attempted to evade any provision or requirement of this chapter;

                  d.  Made a material misrepresentation or omission of fact in its permit application. 
                  (g)  Cancellation for cause. If a utility fails to cure a default within 20 working days after such notice is provided to the utility by the city, then such default shall be a material breach and city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity to terminate the permit. If the city decides there is cause or reason to terminate, the following procedure shall be followed: 
                  (1)  City shall serve a utility with a written notice of the reason or cause for proposed termination and shall allow a utility a minimum of 15 calendar days to cure its breach. 
                  (2)  If the utility fails to cure within 15 calendar days, the city may declare the permit terminated. 
                  (h)  Expiration of permit. If work is not begun within six months of the date of issuance, the permit will automatically expire. 
                  (Ord. of  9-26-2017 ) 
                  Sec. 46-174. - Required minimum standards. 
                  (a)  Utility Accommodation Manual adopted. The "Utility Accommodation Policy and Standards, 2016", including all references contained therein to codes, rules, regulations, schedules, forms and appendix items, except Appendix A ("Permit Forms and supporting Documents"), promulgated by the State of Georgia Department of Transportation, as may be amended from time to time is hereby adopted by reference and incorporated in the article as if fully set forth herein, subject to the amendments and modification contained in this chapter. A copy of the manual shall be maintained at the city and open for public inspection. Any conflicts between the provisions of this article and the manual shall be resolved in favor of the manual. References to state personnel, agencies, and fees shall be interpreted, where required, as meaning the City of Suwanee municipal equivalents. 
                  (b)  Protection of traffic and roadway. Unless specifically in the permit, no utility may occupy the city rights-of-way unless sufficient space is available so that the free flow and safety of traffic and other capacity considerations are not unduly impaired and the installation does not prevent the city from reasonably maintaining the streets, structures, traffic control devices and other appurtenant facilities, and further provided that maintenance and operations of the facilities do not jeopardize the traffic, street structure, other users of the right-of-way or the right-of-way itself. 
                  (c)  Grading. If the grades or lines of any street within the city right-of-way are changed at any time by the city during the term of the permit and this change involves an area in which the utility's facilities are located, then the utility shall, at its own cost and expense and upon the request of the city upon reasonable notice, protect or promptly alter or relocate the facilities, or any part thereof, so as to conform with such new grades or lines. In the event the utility refuses or neglects to so protect, alter, or relocate all or part of the facilities, the city shall have the right to break through, remove, alter, or relocate all or any part of the facilities without any liability to the utility and the utility shall pay to the city the costs incurred in connection with such breaking through, removal, alteration, or relocation. 
                  (d)  Installation of poles and other wireholding structures and relocation. Unless otherwise provided in a valid service agreement, no placement of any pole or wireholding structure of the utility is to be considered a vested interest in the right-of-way, and such poles or structures are to be removed, relocated underground, or modified by the utility at its own expense whenever the city determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. The facilities shall be so located and installed as to cause minimum interference with the rights and convenience of property owners. 
                  (e)  As provided in O.C.G.A § 25-9-6 (the Georgia Utility Facility Protection Act) and other applicable state law currently in place or as amended, no utility shall commence, perform, or engage in blasting or in excavating with mechanized excavating facilities unless and until the utility planning the blasting or excavating has given 48 hours' notice by submitting a locate request to the utility protection center, beginning the next working day after such notice is provided, excluding hours during days other than working days. 
                  (Ord. of  9-26-2017 ) 
                  Sec. 46-175. - Restoration of property. 
                  (a)  Each utility shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any facilities in the rights-of-way and adjoining property or other facilities which it or its facilities damage. 
                  (b)  A utility shall be liable, at its own cost and expense, to replace, restore or repair, any street, facilities or property or structure thereon, thereunder, thereover or adjacent thereto that may become disturbed or damaged as a result of the construction or installation, operation, upgrade, repair or removal of facilities to a condition as good as or better than its condition before the work performed by the utility that caused such disturbance or damage. If the utility does not commence such replacement or repair after 20 working days following written notice from the city, the city or the owner of the affected structure or property may make such replacement or repair and the utility shall pay the reasonable and actual cost of the same. 
                  (Ord. of  9-26-2017 ) 
                  Sec. 46-176. - Inspection. 
                  (a)  The utility shall make the construction site available to the city and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all reasonable times during the execution and upon completion of the construction. 
                  (b)  At any time, including the time of inspection, the city may order the immediate cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the health, safety, or welfare of the public, violates any law, or which violates the terms and conditions of the permit and/or this chapter or issue an order to correct work which does not conform to the permit and/or applicable standards, conditions or codes. 
                  (c)  When the construction under any permit is completed, the utility shall notify the department. 
                  (Ord. of  9-26-2017 ) 
                  Sec. 46-177. - Other approvals, permits and agreements. 
                  (a)  Additional permits required. The utility shall obtain all construction, building or other permits or approvals as according to city ordinance, state or federal law. In addition, a permittee shall comply with all requirements of laws, shall complete work in a way as to not cause any unnecessary or unauthorized obstructions of sidewalks, streets, waterways or railways, and is responsible for all work done in the rights-of-way regardless of who performs the work. No rights-of-way obstruction or excavation may be performed when seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work, except in the case of an emergency. 
                  Sec. 46-178. - Penalties. 
                  (a)  Every utility convicted of a violation of any provision of this chapter shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000.00 per violation. Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall occur constitute a separate offense. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the city may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief and revocation of licenses or permits. 
                  (Ord. of  9-26-2017 ) 
                  Sec. 46-179. - Other provisions. 
                  (a)  Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this chapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. 
                  (b)  Reservation of regulatory and police powers. The city by issuing a written approval of registration under this chapter, does not surrender or to any extent lose, waive, impair, or lessen the lawful powers and rights, which it has now or may be hereafter vested in the city under the Constitution and Laws of the United States, State of Georgia and the City Charter, and under the provisions of the city's codified ordinances to regulate the use of the rights-of-way. The utility by applying for and being issued a written permit, is deemed to acknowledge that all lawful powers and rights, regulatory power, or police power, or otherwise as are or the same may be from time to time vested in or reserved to the city, shall be in full force and effect and subject to the exercise thereof by the city at any time. A utility is deemed to acknowledge that its interests are subject to the regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public and is deemed to agree to comply with all applicable general laws enacted by the city pursuant to such powers. In particular, all utilities shall comply with city zoning and other land use requirements pertaining to the placement and specifications of facilities. 
                  (c)  Compliance. No person shall be relieved of its obligation to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter by reason of any failure of city to enforce compliance. 
                  (d)  Appeal of administrative decisions. All appeals provided for by this chapter and any notification to the city required by this chapter shall be in writing and sent via certified mail to the city manager. 
                  (e)  Chapter headings. Chapter headings are for convenience only and shall not be used to interpret any portion of this chapter.

                  (a)  Use of estimated information for returns. All occupational taxes levied under this article are computed on the volume of business to be conducted during the current calendar year; however, for the convenience of the city and the business community, each business or professional subject to the levy of an occupational tax shall, on or before the dates set forth in subsection (f) of this section, file with the licensing and revenue officer the application and return provided for, showing the gross receipts of that business during the preceding calendar year. This return shall be used as the basis for making estimated payments on the tax due for the current calendar year. The final actual amount of tax payable in a calendar year shall be computed and paid based upon the final return of taxable gross receipts to be made after the end of the year. 
                  (b)  Final returns. The owner or responsible official of each business subject to the occupational tax shall, after the end of the taxable year, and on or before March 31 of the ensuing year, file with the licensing and revenue officer a signed application and return in the form required, setting forth the amount of gross receipts for the business for the preceding calendar year. This form will be used to determine the final tax due for the year just ended and as an estimate of the gross receipts and occupational tax for the current year. 
                  (c)  Part year returns. Where the business subject to the tax levied in this article has been conducted for less than the full preceding calendar year, the amount of actual gross receipts shall be included on the return. Such return shall also include a figure, that when combined with the actual receipts, will be a reasonable estimate of an annualized, whole-year gross receipts. 
                  (d)  Newly established businesses. In the case of a newly established business subject to an occupational tax in the current year, and for which no business was conducted within the city in the previous calendar year, the owner or responsible official shall, prior to the actual commencement of business, file a return estimating the gross receipts for the current calendar year, and the tax shall be computed thereon. The tax shall become due 30 days from filing of the return and shall be delinquent if not paid within 30 days of the due date. 
                  (e)  False or fraudulent returns or estimates. Failure to supply complete or accurate information is punishable pursuant to this article. In addition to any other sanctions available, upon a finding that an estimated projection of gross receipts is unreasonable, or would result in a substantial underpayment of tax, the licensing and revenue officer may impose a reasonable estimate of gross receipts and compute the tax thereon. 
                  (f)  Dates. Unless otherwise provided for in this article, the following deadlines are applicable: 
                  (1)  Final returns and applications for occupational tax certificates are due no later than February 15. 
                  (2)  The amount of occupational tax for the current year shall be payable on January 1 and shall become delinquent if not paid by March 31 of that year. 
                  (3)  Final payment of underpaid prior year's tax is due no later than March 31 of the ensuing year, or 30 days from receipt of a final statement, whichever is later. 
                  (4)  Applications by newly established businesses are due prior to commencing business operations, and payments are due no later than 30 days from filing of the application and return.

                  (b)  If the amount of the occupational tax required in this article, computed based upon the final return, is less than the amount of the occupational tax previously paid by the business based upon an estimated filing, the difference in amounts shall be due and payable as provided for in this article, and shall become delinquent if not paid. 
                  (c)  If the amount paid for an occupational tax during the immediately preceding year, computed on the estimated gross receipts for the period, is more than the amount due as computed upon the final actual return, the overpayment difference shall be refundable to the business, or alternatively, if the business enterprise remains in existence, the overpayment may be credited towards the estimated occupational tax due for the current year. 
                  (d)  Refunds of the occupational tax shall be permitted where there has occurred a clerical error in the submission of a return or application, or where there has been discovered a clerical error in business classification or tax computation, or where there has been a voluntary or involuntary overpayment of the tax. Written requests for refund of the occupational tax, or any part thereof, must be filed with the licensing and revenue officer by the owner or responsible business official, and the request shall set forth a detailed justification for a claim for a refund. 
                  (e)  Evidence of gross receipts generated during any period may be substantiated by a certified copy of Schedule C of Form 1040 filed with the Internal Revenue Service by the certificate holder, and shall be required to be submitted upon request of the licensing and revenue officer.

                  The occupational tax levied in this article is for revenue purposes only and is not for regulatory purposes, nor is the payment of the tax made a condition precedent to the practice of any such profession, trade or calling. The occupational tax only applies to those businesses and occupations which are covered by the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-13-5—48-13-26.

On any new profession, trade or calling begun in the city in 1995 or succeeding years, the registration and tax shall be delinquent if not applied for and obtained prior to beginning business, and with payment within 30 days of such application. The certificate provided for in this article shall be issued by the licensing and revenue collection officer and if any person, firm or corporation whose duty it is to obtain a registration, after such registration or occupational tax becomes delinquent, shall transact or offer to transact in the city any profession, trade or calling subject to this article without having first obtained such registration, such offender shall, upon conviction by the city judge, be punished as set forth in section 1-11. 
                  (b)  In addition the remedies in this section, the city may proceed to collect such tax in the same manner as provided by law for tax executions.

                  For those businesses that have multiple locations inside and outside of the city where gross receipts can be allocated to each location, the gross receipts used to determine the occupational tax assessed will be those gross receipts attributed to each location in the city. Where the dollar amount of gross receipts attributed locally cannot be determined in those businesses with multiple locations, the total gross receipts will be divided by the total number of locations in the city and elsewhere, and allotted to those locations. Upon request, the business of a practitioner with a location or office situated in more than one jurisdiction shall provide to the city the following: 
                  (1)  Financial information necessary to allocate the gross receipts of the business or practitioner; and 
                  (2)  Information relating to the allocation of the business' and practitioner's gross receipts by other local governments. 
                  Where the business has locations outside of the city and taxation is levied for a criteria other than gross receipts in the other local governments, the city shall not assess more than the allotted share of gross receipts for the local operation.

                  (Ord. of 11-15-2005) 
                  Sec. 54-49. - Contesting the civil penalty. 
                  (a)  In accordance with O.C.G.A. § 40-6-20(D), liability shall be determined based upon a preponderance of the evidence. Prima-facie evidence that the vehicle described in the citation issued pursuant to this ordinance was operated in violation of O.C.G.A. § 40-6-20(a), together with proof that the defendant was at the time of such violation the registered owner of the vehicle, shall permit the trier of fact in its discretion to infer that such owner of the vehicle was the driver of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation. Such an inference may be rebutted if the owner of the vehicle: 
                  (1)  Testifies under oath in open court that he or she was not the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation. 
                  (2)  Presents to the court prior to the return date established on the citation a certified copy of a police report showing that the vehicle had been reported to the police as stolen prior to the time of the alleged violation. 
                  (3)  Submits to the court prior to the return date established on the citation a sworn notarized statement identifying the name of the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation. 
                  (4)  Such presumption shall be rebutted if the recorded image depicts the vehicle passed through the intersection in violation of section 54-44 et seq. of the Suwanee City Code as part of a funeral procession. 
                  (5)  Such presumption shall be rebutted if the recorded image depicts the vehicle passed through the intersection in violation of section 54-44 et seq. of the Suwanee City Code in order to avoid impeding the efforts of an emergency vehicle to pass through the intersection. 
                  (6)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the recorded image detected by a traffic light signal violation monitoring system depicts the vehicle passed through the intersection in violation of section 54-44 et seq. of the Suwanee City Code is commercially licensed, then the owner of that vehicle shall be sent notice of the date, time and location of the alleged violation with at least two recorded images thereof. Within ten days of the receipt of said notice, the owner of the vehicle shall provide proof to the city of the name and address of the driver of the vehicle at the date, time and location of the violation and within the same time period, shall provide the driver of the vehicle with at least two recorded images of the alleged violation. After receipt by the city of the proof of the name address of the driver of the vehicle, the driver of the vehicle shall be prima facie responsible for such violation. Failure of the owner of the vehicle found to be in violation of section 54-44 et seq. of the Suwanee City Code to provide the name and address of the driver at the time of the violation within the period prescribed shall cause the owner to be held responsible. 
                  (b)  The provisions of this ordinance shall not limit law enforcement agencies to the use of traffic-control signal monitoring devices in enforcing O.C.G.A. § 40-6-20(a); and, when there is evidence obtained from another source or sources which constitutes a prima-facie case of a violation of O.C.G.A. § 40-6-20(a), such violation may be prosecuted as otherwise provided by law in lieu of, but not in addition to, enforcement under this ordinance.
