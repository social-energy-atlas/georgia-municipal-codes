PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the County of Lincoln, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Index 
                  The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Milton E. Lefkoff, Senior Code Attorney, and Catherine Ponson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
                  The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Ben B. Ross, County Attorney, and Ms. Roxanne B. Ashmore, County Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the county readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the county's affairs.

                  Be it Ordained by the Board of Commissioners of Lincoln County, Georgia:

                  Section 2. All ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted on or before December 11, 2003, and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein, are repealed. 
                  Section 3. The repeal provided for in Section 2 hereof shall not be construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance that is repealed by this ordinance. 
                  Section 4. Unless another penalty is expressly provided, every person convicted of a violation of any provision of the Code or any ordinance of the county shall be punished by a fine of not less than $100.00 and not to exceed $1,000.00, by imprisonment in the county jail for a period of time not to exceed 60 days or by both such fine and imprisonment, or up to the limits of any penalty provided by state law for the ordinance. Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall continue or occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any Code section whether or not such penalty is enacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the county may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief and revocation of licenses or permits. 
                  Section 5. Additions or amendments to the Code, when passed in the form as to indicate the intention of the Board of Commissioners to make the same a part of the Code, shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments. 
                  Section 6. Ordinances adopted after December 11, 2003, that amend or refer to ordinances that have been codified in the Code shall be construed as if they amend or refer to like provisions of the Code. 
                  Section 7. This ordinance shall become effective March 11, 2004. 
                  Passed and adopted by the Board of Commissioners this 11th day of March, 2004.

                  (a)  By contract or by county personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared on an annual basis. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive, permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the board of commissioners during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made by the supplement in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages that have become obsolete or partially obsolete.

For example, the codifier may: 
                  (1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions. 
                  (2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles. 
                  (3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers. 
                  (4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _____ to _____" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code that embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and 
                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
                  Sec. 1-14. - Effective date of ordinances and resolutions.

When such meetings are to be held, the clerk shall provide notice to the legal organ of the county or a newspaper with a general circulation at least equal to that of the legal organ and to each member of the board of commissioners as soon as possible. The notice shall include the subjects expected to be considered at the meeting. In addition, the minutes shall reflect the reason for the emergency meeting and the nature of the notice given to the media.

                  Sec. 2-68. - Executive sessions. 
                  (a)  Executive sessions of the board may be held for the purpose of conducting business excepted from public access requirements as authorized by O.C.G.A. §§ 50-14-2 and 50-14-3. Where a meeting of the board is devoted in part to matters within the authorized exceptions to public access requirements, any portion of the meeting not subject to any such exceptions shall be open to the public. 
                  (b)  No executive session shall be held except pursuant to a majority affirmative vote of a quorum present at the meeting. The minutes of the public meeting shall reflect the names of the commissioners present, those voting for the executive session and the specific reasons for the executive session. Minutes of the executive session may be maintained by the clerk of the board of commissioners at the direction of the chair. Any such minutes shall be maintained in a confidential file and shall not be subject to disclosure, except that disclosures of such portions of minutes identifying real estate to be acquired by the board may only be delayed until such time as the acquisition of the real estate has been completed, terminated, or abandoned or court proceedings have been initiated. The board shall comply with any other requirements of O.C.G.A.

                  Rules of order may be suspended in the case of an emergency. A motion to suspend the rules requires a second, is debatable and requires a majority vote of the board. Rules governing quorum, section 2-53, voting methods and requirements, sections 2-54 and 2-55, the notification to commissioners of meetings, sections 2-67 and 2-68 and rules necessary for compliance with state law cannot be suspended.

                  Sec. 2-70. - Committees. 
                  The chair may create committees of members of the board to study any issue before the board or contemplated by the board to be an issue. Any such committees may make recommendations to the board of commissioners but no committee shall be empowered to make any final decision on any matter before it for consideration. In addition to board members, committees may include other county officials, staff or citizens at large. Whenever a committee is created, its duties, any limitation on the scope of its duties, and the times, places and periods of time for which the committee may operate shall be determined by the chair with the concurrence of the board. The chair shall serve as an ex officio member of all committees.

                  All meetings of the board of commissioners shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of this division. 
                  (Ord. No. 45, 12-12-2002) 
                  Sec. 2-102. - Main motion. 
                  In order for the board to take any official action on any subject, a commissioner must propose a main motion. A proposed main motion will not be recognized by the chair until another commissioner agrees to second the motion. A second does not require the commissioner seconding the motion to support the motion. A commissioner may withdraw a main motion that he has made at any time before the board has voted on that motion. 
                  (Ord. No. 45, § 1-01, 12-12-2002) 
                  Sec. 2-103. - Debate. 
                  (a)  After the main motion is recognized by the chair, the board of commissioners shall debate the motion. The debate shall be managed by the chair in a manner that is fair to all members of the board. Commissioners can participate in the debate only when they are recognized by the chair. 
                  (b)  During the course of debate, commissioners may introduce subsidiary motions that propose that the board take a particular action on a motion, section 2-106. There are two classes of subsidiary motions: debatable subsidiary motions and undebatable subsidiary motions. 
                  (1)  Debatable subsidiary motions consist of motions to postpone indefinitely, amend, refer to committee, and postpone to a time certain and require a second before they can be voted on or debated. 
                  (2)  There are three undebatable subsidiary motions: 
                  a.  Limit debate; 
                  b.  Vote immediately; and 
                  c.  Lay on the table. 
                  They require a second and cannot be debated. 
                  (c)  Commissioners may also introduce privileged motions, section 2-107. Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting and can be introduced during the course of debate. Privileged motions consist of a motion to raise a question of privilege and motions to recess and adjourn. The motions to recess and adjourn require a second. Debate is not allowed on privileged motions. 
                  (Ord. No. 45, § 1-02, 12-12-2002) 
                  Sec. 2-104. - Voting; procedure. 
                  Voting on debatable motions and voting on undebatable motions shall take place in accordance with the following provisions: 
                  (1)  Debatable motions. In the case of debatable motions, the vote can be proposed in one of two ways: 
                  a.  If debate has been completed and no other commissioner wishes to speak, the chair can call for the vote. If there are no objections then the chair can proceed with the vote; 
                  b.  If the chair calls for the vote and there is an objection, a member of the board may move to vote immediately ("move the previous question"). If this motion is seconded and approved by a majority vote of a quorum, present at the meeting, debate will stop. The chair will then state the proposed motion to the board and ask for the votes of the commissioners. 
                  (2)  Undebatable motions. In the case of undebatable motions, the vote shall occur immediately after the motion is recognized by the chair. The chair shall state the proposed motion to the board and then call for the vote. 
                  (Ord. No. 45, § 1-03, 12-12-2002) 
                  Sec. 2-105. - Ranking of motions. 
                  (a)  Each subsidiary and privileged motion is assigned a specific rank. A motion of higher precedence can interrupt a motion of lower precedence. The higher motion must be decided before the board returns to consider the motion of lower precedence. 
                  (b)  A main motion has the lowest rank and does not take precedence over any other motion. A motion to adjourn has the highest rank and will take precedence over all other subsidiary and privileged motions. The order of precedence of motions shall be in accordance with this section. Motions at the top of the following list take precedence over motions at the bottom of the list. 

                   
                  (Ord. No. 45, § 1-04, 12-12-2002) 
                  Sec. 2-106. - Subsidiary motions. 
                  During the course of debate, commissioners may introduce motions that propose that the board take a particular action on a main motion. These motions are called subsidiary motions and they allow a board to reach a conclusion on the main motion. Subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. Three subsidiary motions, amend, limit debate and vote immediately, also can apply to other subsidiary motions. 
                  (1)  Postpone indefinitely. If a commissioner believes that the main motion should not be considered by the board, that commissioner may move to postpone the consideration of the main motion indefinitely. If the motion is successful, consideration of the main motion stops and the main motion is tabled for the duration of the meeting. A motion to postpone indefinitely can be debated but it cannot be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (2)  Amend. 
                  a.  If a commissioner believes that a main motion that is being discussed should be changed in order to make it more acceptable, he can move to amend the motion. Amendments must be closely related to the original motion and must not change the nature of the motion that they amend. Motions to refer, amend, postpone to a time certain and the motion to recess can also be amended. A motion cannot be amended more than two times. 
                  b.  Debate is allowed on a motion to amend only if the original motion is debatable. Debate is limited to the proposed amendment. A majority vote is required for the board to adopt an amendment. If the amendment is adopted then the board shall consider the amended version of the motion. 
                  (3)  Refer to a committee (commit). If a commissioner believes that further information is needed before the board can act on a main motion, he may propose that the motion be referred to a specific committee or department for further study. If an appropriate committee does not already exist, then a committee may be formed as a part of the motion. A motion to commit should specify the date that the committee or department will report back to the board. This motion is debatable and amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (4)  Postpone to a time certain (postpone definitely). A motion to postpone to a certain time may be proposed if a commissioner believes that the main motion should not be considered until a future time. This motion shall set a particular time for the main motion to be considered again. It is debatable and can be amended. If this motion is passed, the chair will bring the original motion back to the board for consideration at the specified time which may be at the same meeting, at a subsequent meeting, or upon the occurrence of a specified event. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (5)  Limit or extend limits or debate. A motion to limit debate places a time constraint on the length of debate. The details of such a motion are to be decided by the commissioner who makes the motion. This motion can also be used to extend the limits of debate if a limit on debate already exists. Debate is not allowed on this motion and a majority vote is required. 
                  (6)  Vote immediately (previous question). If a commissioner believes debate on a motion should end and that the motion that is being considered should be voted on, the commissioner can move to vote immediately. The motion is undebatable and a vote of majority of the board is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (7)  Lay on the table (postpone temporarily). A motion to lay on the table proposes that the consideration of a main motion be postponed until a later time in the same meeting. The main motion can be brought back for consideration only if a motion to resume consideration is accepted by the board during the same meeting. The motion will die if it is not taken up during the meeting. Debate is not allowed on this motion and the motion is not amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (Ord. No. 45, § 1-05, 12-12-2002) 
                  Sec. 2-107. - Privileged motions. 
                  Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting. They do not address or relate to a main motion and can be introduced whether or not there is a main motion under consideration. Privileged motions take precedence over all subsidiary motions. Debate is not allowed on these motions. 
                  (1)  Question of privilege. A formal question addressed to the chair concerning the rights of a commissioner or of the board as a whole is referred to as a question of privilege. It does not require a second and cannot be debated or amended. The chair is required to make a ruling on the question. 
                  (2)  Recess. A motion to recess proposes that the meeting be suspended for a particular amount of time when business is still pending. It is a temporary intermission of the proceedings. The motion must specify the length of the recess. The motion must also be seconded. Debate is not allowed on this motion but the motion can be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (3)  Adjourn. In order for a meeting to come to a close, a commissioner must make a motion to adjourn. The motion to adjourn has the highest rank of any motion and as a result it can be introduced at any time. The motion requires a second, but is not debatable or amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (Ord. No. 45, § 1-06, 12-12-2002) 
                  Sec. 2-108. - Incidental motions. 
                  Incidental motions allow commissioners to exert their rights as a member of the board. Incidental motions can be introduced at any time during a meeting. 
                  (1)  Appeal. If a commissioner disagrees with a ruling that is made by the chair, that commissioner may appeal the decision. If the appeal is seconded, the appeal will be considered by the board. The chair has the opportunity to explain the ruling that has been challenged. The board may then debate the appeal. The board shall decide by majority vote if the chair's decision is to be upheld or overturned. An appeal is high in precedence and can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or by a lay on the table. 
                  (2)  Parliamentary inquiry. If a commissioner has a question about the rules of order, he may ask the chair to give an opinion on that question. This question should take the form of a parliamentary inquiry and should relate to the current business of the board. This motion takes precedence over all motions except privileged motions. This motion does not require a second and is not debatable or amendable. 
                  (3)  Point of order (question of order). If a commissioner believes that a violation of the rules of parliamentary procedure has occurred, he can raise a point of order. A second is not required. The chair can make a ruling on the question or can allow the board to debate and then rule on the question by majority vote. A point of order can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or a motion to lay on the table. 
                  (4)  Point of information (request for information). If a commissioner has a question about the facts of a particular issue that is being considered, he may ask for a point of information. This motion is addressed first to the chair and then to the appropriate person. A second is not required and the motion is not debatable or amendable. 
                  (Ord. No. 45, § 1-07, 12-12-2002) 
                  Sec. 2-109. - Supplementary main motions. 
                  Three motions allow the board to act on a main motion that has either been passed or tabled by the board. These motions are considered to be main motions but differ from usual main motions in the ways specified. 
                  (1)  Reconsider. The motion to reconsider allows the board to debate whether or not to overturn a decision made at the meeting that is in progress. It allows the board to consider new information that may affect the decision that has already been made. Any commissioner can make a motion to reconsider and any commissioner may second the motion. The motion is debatable but it cannot be amended. A majority vote of the board is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to reconsider is passed, the original decision will be voided and the board will return to debate and revote the original motion. 
                  (2)  Rescind. A motion to rescind proposes that the board overturn a motion passed at a previous meeting. A motion to rescind can be made by any commissioner. It is in order as long as the original motion has not been implemented. An announcement of the intention to rescind a motion may be made at the meeting where the decision was made, or the commissioner seeking to rescind may place the matter on the agenda for the next meeting. The motion to rescind will then be placed on the agenda for the next meeting. At the next meeting, the motion to rescind will formally be made. If it is seconded, then the board shall debate and vote on rescission. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to rescind is passed, the original decision will be voided. 
                  (3)  Resume consideration. The motion to resume consideration allows the board to consider a motion that has been temporarily postponed. This motion requires a second and is not debatable or amendable. It is a main motion but ranks higher than any debatable motion. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.

                  Sec. 6-31. - Purpose and intent. 
                  (a)  It is the purpose of the board of commissioners in enacting this article to provide standards to safeguard life, public health, property and welfare by regulating the location, size, illumination, erection, maintenance and quality of materials of all signs. More specifically, signs have a powerful impact on the aesthetic environment of the community, and it is the purpose of this article to encourage an aesthetically attractive environment, while allowing sufficient opportunities for communications to serve business and comply with the federal and state constitutions and laws. Signs create visual clutter and therefore should be regulated in their size, location, construction and illumination. Signs can detract from the beauty of the neighborhood and lower property values. In seeking to comply with federal and state law, the board of commissioners has determined the following: 
                  (1)  Large billboards are, as the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized, and aesthetic harm; 
                  (2)  The state supreme court has upheld sign regulations on the basis of aesthetics and preserving the beauty of the environment; and 
                  (3)  The Eleventh Circuit has recognized portable signs are visual clutter and a potential traffic hazard. 
                  The holdings show that this article is within the law and therefore constitutional, which is a goal of the county. 
                  (b)  Many signs can also be a hazard and negatively impact traffic safety, by distracting drivers and blocking views of other vehicles and dangers, by making intersections more treacherous, and by making it difficult to see oncoming traffic when entering a roadway. Therefore, it is also the purpose of this article to prevent those harms by regulating signs to safe locations, safe sizes, with proper and safe illumination and construction.

Notice shall be given to the permit holder and/or property owner, then to the owner of the sign; or if the sign owner cannot be found or cannot be determined, notice shall be given to the sign erector or property owner, or any party associated with such sign.

If the sign owner cannot be found or cannot be determined, then the costs of removal shall be the responsibility of the sign erector and/or property owner or any other party associated with the placement of the sign. If removed by the county as referenced in this article, and for the purposes of collecting any and all reimbursable cost to the county for such removal; if payment, or satisfactory arrangements to make payment, is not made by the property owner, sign erector, or owner within 30 days after the receipt of the statement, the enforcement personnel shall certify the amount thereof for collection to the county attorney.

If any signs that are removed remain unclaimed for more than 60 days from the date of removal, the signs may be disposed of in accordance with state law. 
                  (d)  Invalid permits. The enforcement personnel may issue a removal order when it has been determined that a permit was improperly issued as a result of misstatement of fact or fraud, that the sign has not been placed or constructed in compliance with this article or with the specifications of the application or site plans, that the sign permit has expired or that the sign is otherwise not in compliance with this article. If a sign is not removed after receipt of a removal order, enforcement personnel may institute legal proceedings hereunder against the property owner, sign owner, lessee, sign erector, associated party, or combination thereof. 
                  (e)  Nonconforming signs. 
                  (1)  Signs which do not comply with this article and were legally placed before the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall become nonconforming with respect to the requirements set forth in this article; however, signs which were illegally erected, established or maintained with respect to the applicable requirements of prior ordinances shall be removed or brought into compliance with the provisions of this article. Nonconforming signs made of paper, cloth or other nondurable material, all temporary signs other than those permitted therein, and any signs that are not affixed to a building or the ground, or are located within a public right-of-way, may be removed.

                  (2)  A nonconforming sign shall not be replaced by another nonconforming sign except that the substitution or interchange of advertising panels, painted boards or demountable material on nonconforming signs shall be permitted. Those signs considered grandfathered upon the passage of zoning shall be governed by the signage requirements for the zoning classification, as designated by the DCA, which most closely approximates its use. 
                  (3)  Minor repairs and maintenance of nonconforming signs such as repainting, electrical repairs and neon tubing may be permitted. However, no structural repairs or changes in the size or shape of the sign shall be permitted except to make the sign comply with the requirements of this article. 
                  (4)  If a nonconforming sign must be removed due to a county or state road improvement or other project, the planning commission may authorize the relocation of such sign even though the new location may not meet the setbacks, or other provisions of this article. 
                  (f)  Fines and penalties. 
                  (1)  Without limitation, sign erectors or owners, property owners and/or associated parties may be cited for the violation of any provision of this article in accordance with section 14-427. 
                  (2)  The fine for any one sign found in violation of this article tried upon a citation or upon an accusation shall be as provided in section 14-427.

Any defendant who is charged with one or more ordinance violations may, at any time before trial, demand that the case be removed for a jury trial to the state court of the county or to the superior court of the county if there is no state court. Such a demand shall be written. Upon such a demand the court shall grant the demand. Failure to so demand removal of the case shall constitute a waiver of any right to trial by jury which the defendant may otherwise have. 
                  (Ord. No. 51A, 8-14-2003; Ord. No. 51B, § 4, 10-16-2003) 
                  Sec. 26-105. - Violations of ordinances; prosecution for violations. 
                  (a)  Ordinance violations may be tried upon citations with or without a prosecuting attorney as well as upon accusations. 
                  (b)  Each citation shall state the time and place at which the accused is to appear for trial, shall identify the offense with which the accused is charged, shall have an identifying number by which it shall be filed with the court, shall indicate the identity of the accused and the date of service, and shall be signed by the county agent who completes and serves it. 
                  (c)  Prosecutions for violations of ordinances upon citations shall be commenced by the completion, signing, and service of a citation by any agent of the county who is authorized by the county governing authority to issue citations. A copy of the citation shall be personally served upon the accused; and the original shall promptly be filed with the court. 
                  (d)  No person shall be arrested prior to the time of trial, except for the offenses of public drunkenness or disorderly conduct; provided, however that the accused may be arrested prior to the time of trial for the violation of a county ordinance relating to loitering; and provided, further, that any defendant who fails to appear for trial shall be arrested thereafter on the warrant of the magistrate and required to post a bond for his future appearance. 
                  (Ord. No. 51A, 8-14-2003; Ord. No. 51B, § 5, 10-16-2003) 
                  Sec. 26-106. - Appearance in court; failure to appear. 
                  (a)  The chief magistrate shall establish a schedule of cash bonds for the personal appearance in court of any person charged with a violation of an ordinance. The chief magistrate shall designate the officer authorized to accept cash bonds pursuant to the schedule of bonds published by the court. In no event shall any officer or agent who is authorized to issue citations be authorized to accept a cash bond at the time of or in conjunction with the issuance of any citation. The officer accepting a cash bond shall issue a receipt for the bond to the person charged with the violation. 
                  (b)  Any person who is accused by citation but has not been arrested may, but shall not be required to, give a cash bond for his personal appearance in court for trial. If a person who has given a cash bond fails to appear for trial, the failure to appear shall be deemed to constitute a guilty plea and such cash bond shall be forfeited upon the call of the case for trial. It shall not be necessary for the county to take any further action to forfeit the cash bond. Forfeiture of a cash bond shall be deemed to constitute imposition of a sentence and payment of a fine and shall be a bar to a subsequent prosecution of the accused for the violation. The court may, however, in any case enter an order pursuant to which bond forfeiture shall not be deemed to constitute imposition of a sentence and subsequent prosecution shall not be barred; and in any such case the amount of the bond forfeited shall be credited against any fine subsequently imposed. 
                  (c)  It shall be the duty of the clerk of magistrate court to furnish the officer authorized under the order with a book of blank receipts consecutively numbered in triplicate and readily distinguishable and identifiable. The receipts shall be completed by the officers when accepting a cash bond so as to show the name of the person cited or arrested, the date of citation or arrest, nature of the offense, amount of cash bond given, and the name of the receiving officer. The receiving officer shall deliver a copy of the receipt to the person cited or arrested at the time the cash bond is given and shall file the original together with the cash bond with the clerk of the magistrate court not later than the next succeeding business day following the date of issuance of the receipt.

Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land- disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15), (16) and (17), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2); 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25 foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the Director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50 foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed ; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25 foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (17)  There is established a 25 foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25 foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c). 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

                  Sec. 30-100. - Authorization. 
                  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the county commissioners, of Lincoln County, Georgia, does ordain as follows: 
                  (Ord. No. 55, 11-10-2005; Amend. of 4-10-2008) 
                  Sec. 30-101. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of Lincoln County, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. No. 55, 11-10-2005; Amend. of 4-10-2008) 
                  Sec. 30-102. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion, and; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions, and; 
                  (7)  To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  Existing construction means any structure for which the "start of construction" commenced before April 14, 2005 (i.e., the effective date of the FIRST floodplain management code or ordinance adopted by the community as a basis for that community's participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)). 
                  Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before April 14, 2005 (i.e., the effective date of the FIRST floodplain management regulations adopted by a community). 
                  Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads.

                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the water shed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is:

                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program the term is synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after July 6, 2010 (the effective date of the initial firm) and includes any subsequent improvements to the structure. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after April 14, 2005 (the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the county) and includes any subsequent improvements. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after April 14, 2005 (i.e., the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community). 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA flood management maps. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle, which is:

                  (4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are NOT exempt from any ordinance requirements). For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. The market value of the building should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements: Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 30-400(4), "Elevated Buildings". 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction: New construction or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 30-302(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles: Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (ref. subsection 30-400(f) above) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions), or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (3)a and c, above. 
                  (4)  Floodway: Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 30-201, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection (4)a. above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 4.

                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the director of planning and zoning or designee in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the county planning commission may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Lincoln County, Georgia, as provided in Section 5-4-1 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the county planning board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (Ord. No. 55, 11-10-2005; Amend. of 4-10-2008) 
                  Sec. 30-501. - Conditions for variances. 
                  (a)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  (1)  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  (2)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and; 
                  (3)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (b)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (c)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (d)  The planning and zoning director or designee shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (e)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the county planning and zoning board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

Site plan approval and nonresidential subdivision plat approval may proceed simultaneously at the discretion of the planning commission. A nonresidential subdivision shall be subject to all the requirements of these regulations, as well as such additional standards required by the planning commission, and shall conform to the proposed land use and standards established in the comprehensive plan. 
                  (b)  Standards. In addition to the principles and standards in this chapter, which are appropriate to the planning of all subdivisions, the applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the planning commission that the street, parcel, and block pattern proposed is specifically adapted to the uses anticipated and takes into account other uses in the vicinity. The following principles and standards shall be observed: 
                  (1)  All proposed industrial parcels shall be suitable in area and dimension to the types of industrial development anticipated.

                  ARTICLE IV. - PROCEDURE FOR PLAT APPROVAL 

                  Sec. 34-101. - Procedure. 
                  (a)  Subdivision defined. A "subdivision" is the division of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots or building sites. "Subdivision" also relates to the process of subdividing or to the land or area subdivided. The term shall also include the opening of a new street or road. The combination or recombination of portions of previously platted lots where the total number of lots is not increased and the resultant lots meet the standards of the county subdivision regulations are not included within this definition. 
                  (b)  Steps for approval. The procedure for review, consideration and approval of a subdivision plat consists of two separate steps, which are: 
                  (1)  Preliminary subdivision plat (step 1); 
                  (2)  Final subdivision plat (step 2). 
                  (c)  Official submission dates. For the purpose of this chapter, the date of the meeting of the planning commission at which the hearing of a preliminary plat or public meeting on approval of a final subdivision plat, including any adjourned date thereof, is closed, accordingly shall constitute the official submission date of the plat on which the statutory period required for formal approval, conditional approval or disapproval of the preliminary plat or final plat submittal shall commence to run. 
                  (d)  Compliance with plat requirements. Approval of all steps is contingent upon full compliance with the plat requirements specified in sections 34-131—34-141 and 34-171—34-178. Step 1 shall be completed prior to making any street improvement or installing any utilities. Step 2 shall be completed prior to the sale of any lots in the proposed subdivision. 
                  (e)  Exemptions from preliminary plat requirements. 
                  (1)  A subdivision which will have four or fewer lots fronting on a road or street shown on the official road map of the county; provided no new street, community water system, or community sewer system is required and provided no new lots have a depth greater than 2.5 times the width, shall be exempted from the requirements of a preliminary plat approval. The subdivision shall be required to obtain a recording and approval certificate as a final plat. 
                  (2)  Any division of land to heirs or any division of land pursuant to a judicial partition, or any division of land occurring from the foreclosure of a deed of trust; provided, however, that such exemption shall not require the county to issue permits if the resulting lots or parcels fail to meet any applicable regulations of the local jurisdiction. A plat meeting this exemption must have the following notation on the plat: 
                  "This final plat is exempt from the preliminary plat requirements, however, the lots shown on the plat are for estate planning purposes only, do not meet the minimum requirements of the Land Development Ordinance of Lincoln County, and no building permit will be issued for development on these lots as they are shown on this plat.

                  Sec. 34-102. - Preapplication. 
                  Prior to the review, consideration and approval of a preliminary plat by the planning commission, the subdivider may schedule an initial meeting with the director of planning and zoning to discuss the proposed development. The developer may offer a simple sketch plan for comments from the director if desired. The purpose of the meeting is to assist the subdivider with questions he may have prior to extensive site planning necessary for the preparation of the preliminary plat and enable the subdivider to become familiar with the regulations affecting the land to be subdivided. Recommendations received from the director of planning and zoning concerning the proposed development or the sketch plan do not authorize the developer to begin the proposed construction or improvements.

                  Sec. 34-131. - Application procedure. 
                  (a)  A complete application for preliminary approval of a subdivision plat shall be submitted to the director of planning and zoning together with the appropriate fee as determined by the board of commissioners. The director shall not accept a fee until an application has been completed according to the requirements of this section. 
                  (b)  No less than five copies of the plat of the subdivision shall be submitted and shall be such as to meet the minimum requirements contained in this chapter. Also, one copy shall be returned to the owner or proprietor of the subdivision or his representative with the date of the approval or disapproval noted thereon. The sheet size shall not exceed 18 by 24 inches nor be less than 8 ½ by 11 inches. If the complete plat cannot be shown on one sheet, it may be shown on more than one sheet with an index map on a separate sheet of the same size. Each copy shall have original signatures in a contrasting color. 
                  (c)  Any preliminary plat submitted to the planning commission shall contain the name, phone number and address of the subdivider (or subdivider's designee); and no preliminary plat shall be approved by the planning commission without full compliance with the requirements of the preliminary plat. The preliminary plat shall be prepared by a licensed land surveyor, registered professional engineer or licensed landscape architect. 
                  (d)  Additional copies of the plat and supplemental information may be requested by the planning commission. The above-mentioned copies shall be distributed to any other person or agency as deemed necessary by the planning commission. The person or agency to which a copy of the preliminary plat is directed shall indicate any desired changes or comments on the plat and submit the plat to the planning commission prior to formal approval of the preliminary plat.

                  Sec. 34-132. - Public hearing. 
                  After acceptance of a complete application for preliminary plat approval, including all accompanying material, by the director, the planning commission shall call a public hearing for the next scheduled meeting of the commission to be held at least 30 days after the date of the application. 
                  (Ord. No. 48, § 6-2, 1-9-2003) 
                  Sec. 34-133. - Public notice. 
                  Public notice of the hearing on the application for preliminary plat approval shall be given at least 15, but not more than 45 days prior to the scheduled public hearing. The director shall file a notice of public hearing which shall be published once in the newspaper of general circulation in the county setting forth the time, place, and purpose of the hearing. Such notice shall identify the property affected. Additionally, at least 15 days before the scheduled public hearing, the director shall post, in a conspicuous place on the property a sign at least two feet by three feet in size. It shall set forth the time, place and purpose of the public hearing before the planning commission. Acts of vandalism or natural occurrences limiting the effectiveness of notice by a sign posted on the property shall not invalidate any proceedings or action taken under this article.

                  Sec. 34-134. - Preliminary plat approval. 
                  (a)  The planning commission shall approve, disapprove or approve with modification, the preliminary plat within 45 days after the date it is presented at the public hearing. If approved, the planning commission shall indicate so in writing, stating the conditions of such approval, if any, or if disapproved, the planning commission shall express in writing its disapproval and its reasons therefore. Failure of the planning commission to act within 45 days after formal submission of the preliminary plat and the public hearing is held, shall be deemed to constitute approval, and certificate to that effect shall be issued by the planning commission on demand; provided, however, that the subdivider may waive this requirement and consent in writing to the extension of such period. 
                  (b)  Preliminary approval of the subdivision plat shall be noted on the plat and certified by the planning commission. Also, noted shall be the date on which the planning commission granted preliminary approval and the date of written notification to the subdivider or subdivider's authorized agent. 
                  (c)  Approval of a preliminary subdivision plat shall not constitute approval of the final subdivision plat. Preliminary approval shall constitute approval of the proposed widths and alignments of streets and the dimensions and shapes of lots subject to the final approval of the county health department. Application for approval of the final record plat will be considered only after the requirements for final plat approval as specified in this chapter have been fulfilled and after all other specified conditions have been met. Upon approval of the preliminary subdivision plat by the planning commission, the subdivider may proceed to comply with the other requirements of these regulations and the preparation of the final subdivision plat.

                  (2)  If a public sewage system is proposed, adequate provision has been made for such a system and, if other methods of sewage disposal are proposed, that such systems will comply with federal, state, and local laws and regulations; 
                  (3)  All proposed streets on the preliminary plat are in conformity with adopted design standards, if any, and existing and proposed public street improvements; 
                  (4)  All areas of the proposed subdivision which may involve soil or topographical conditions presenting hazards or requiring special precautions have been identified by the subdivider and that the proposed uses of these areas are compatible with such conditions; 
                  (5)  The subdivider has the financial ability to complete the proposed subdivision in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations; 
                  (6)  There is not other available subdivided land in the jurisdiction of the county that would be more suitable for the applicant's proposed uses of the subdivision; 
                  (7)  The proposed subdivision will not result in the scattered subdivision of land that leaves undeveloped parcels of land lacking urban services between developed parcels; 
                  (8)  The subdivider has taken every effort to mitigate the impact of the proposed subdivision on public health, safety, and welfare. 
                  (b)  The planning commission is authorized to disapprove the preliminary plat even though the land proposed for subdivision is zoned for the use to which the proposed subdivision will be put and the proposed use is consistent with the comprehensive plan.

                  The planning commission may require that all public improvements be installed and dedicated prior to the signing of the final subdivision plat. If the planning commission does not require that all public improvements be installed and dedicated prior to signing of the final subdivision plat, the planning commission shall require that the applicant execute a subdivision improvement agreement and provide security for the agreement as provided in section 34-311(3). The planning commission shall require the applicant to indicate on the plat all roads and public utility improvements which shall be required to be established or extended, and any other special requirements deemed necessary by the planning commission in order to conform the subdivision plat to the county comprehensive plan.

                  ARTICLE VII. - REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS 

                  Sec. 34-201. - Number of lots versus improvement standards. 
                  (a)  Less restrictive development standards. By permitting varying numbers of lots and varying levels of improvements, regulations enable the small developer to provide for growth in the rural, more slowly developing area of the county characterized by a lower lot absorption rate. Less restrictive development standards are imposed according to quantity of lots to allow for flexibility in subdivision sizes. 

                   
                  (b)  Waiver provision. Where a single lot or parcel of land, in an existing residentially zoned district, is to be subdivided into two or three parcels, the planning commission may waive any and all of the subdivision requirements indicated in section 34-202 under the following conditions: 
                  (1)  The created lots or parcels meet the lot requirements of this chapter. 
                  (2)  All the resultant lots or parcels will have frontage on a county or state maintained roadway or access will be provided through a roadway that meets all criteria of a private street as specified in section 34-207.

                  Sec. 34-202. - Required improvements. 
                  A well-designed subdivision means little to a prospective lot buyer until such buyer can see actual physical transformation of raw land into lots with all necessary improvements provided. Likewise, a well-designed subdivision is not an asset to the community until the necessary improvements have been installed. In order that prospective lot purchasers may get useable products and new subdivisions may be an asset rather than a liability to the community, the subdivider shall install the improvements required by these regulations necessary to serve the subdivision prior to the approval of the final plat. 
                  (1)  Natural gas. When gas lines are located in a street right-of-way, where possible such lines shall be located outside the portion of the street to be surfaced to prevent having to cut into the paved surface to serve abutting properties. 
                  (2)  Water supply. When a water system is installed in a subdivision with more than 30 lots, water mains shall provide a minimum flow of water of 500 gallons per minute for two hours at the furthermost point from the tank. Fire hydrants, whether part of a wet or a dry fire hydrant system, shall be provided at distances not greater than 500 feet apart. When the water main is located in the street to serve the abutting lots a water service line three-fourths inch in size shall be stubbed-out to the property line to serve each lot before the street is surfaced. When connection to a county water system is not available, the county may make an exception to this rule. At the preliminary plat stage, unless granted a waiver by the Lincoln County Board of Commissioners, the water system of a development must connect to the county water system. All systems commercial or residential, public or private, must be approved by the board of commissioners. The water system shall be a permitted community water system as required by the Georgia Safe Drinking Water Act of 1977 (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-170 et seq.). 
                  (3)  Sanitary sewage. If sanitary sewers are installed in a subdivision, sanitary sewers shall be installed to the plans and specifications approved by and in accordance with the rules and administrative regulations of the county health department. When the sewer line is located in a street right-of-way and it will be necessary to cut into the street surface to serve the abutting lots, a connection shall be stubbed-out to the property line to serve each lot prior to surfacing the street. The subdivider shall install sewer mains and sewer laterals, extended to the property line of each lot, in accordance with accepted engineering practices. 
                  (4)  Sewage disposal systems. Prior to the construction of a community sewage disposal system such as private septic tanks, an oxidation pond or other facility, the location, size, plans and specifications of such facility shall be approved by and be in accordance with the rules and administrative regulations of the board of commissioners and the county health department. 
                  (5)  Lighting requirements. In accordance with the requirements of this chapter, lighting requirements necessitate that: 
                  a.  All public streets, sidewalks and other common areas or facilities in subdivisions created after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall be sufficiently illuminated to ensure the security of property and the safety of persons using such streets, sidewalks and other common areas or facilities. 
                  b.  All roads, driveways, sidewalks, parking lots and other common areas and facilities in unsubdivided developments shall be sufficiently illuminated to ensure the security of property and the safety of persons using such roads, driveways, parking lots and other common areas and facilities. 
                  c.  All subdivision entrances shall be adequately lighted to ensure the safety of persons entering and exiting subdivisions. 
                  d.  All entrances and exits in buildings used for nonresidential purposes and in two-family or multifamily residential developments containing more than four dwelling units shall be adequately lighted to ensure the safety of persons and the security of the buildings. 
                  e.  Lighting within any lot that unnecessarily illuminates any other lot and substantially interferes with the use or enjoyment of such other lot is prohibited. Lighting unnecessarily illuminates another lot if it clearly exceeds the standard set forth in this subsection. Also, if the standard set forth in this subsection could reasonably be achieved in a manner that would not substantially interfere with the use or enjoyment of neighboring properties. 
                  (6)  Electricity. Every principal use and every lot within a subdivision shall have available to it a source of electric power adequate to accommodate the reasonable need of such use and every lot within such subdivision. 
                  (7)  Telephone service. Every principal use and every lot within a subdivision shall have available to it a telephone service cable adequate to accommodate the reasonable need of such use and every lot within such subdivision. 
                  (8)  Curb and gutters. If concrete curbs or paved valley type gutters are required, they shall be installed in accordance with plans and specifications prepared by an engineer, registered surveyor or architect and approved by the director or board of commissioners or its designee. 
                  (9)  Street grading and surfacing. Street grading, base preparation, and surfacing shall be carried out by the subdivider according to plans and specifications approved by the county and/or state department of transportation. Prior to acceptance of the streets as part of the county road system, the same must be paved at the expense of the developer and/or owner in accordance with approved plans and specifications and must be conveyed or transferred to the county upon acceptance. The requirement of paved streets prior to acceptance shall not apply to the acceptance process related to public roads. 
                  (10)  Storm drainage. An adequate drainage system, including necessary open ditches, pipes, culverts, storm sewers, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges and other necessary appurtenances shall be installed by the subdivider according to plans and specifications approved by the director. 
                  a.  To the extent practicable, all development shall conform to natural contours of land, and natural and preexisting manmade drainageways shall remain undisturbed. 
                  b.  To the extent practicable, lot boundaries shall be made to coincide with natural and preexisting manmade drainageways within subdivisions to avoid the creation of lots that can be built upon only by altering such drainageways. 
                  c.  All developments shall be provided with a drainage system that is adequate to prevent the undue retention of surface water on the development site. 
                  d.  No surface water may be channeled or directed into a sanitary sewer. 
                  e.  Whenever practicable, the drainage system of a development shall coordinate with and connect to the drainage systems or drainageways on surrounding properties or streets. 
                  f.  Private roads and accessways within unsubdivided developments shall utilize curb and gutter storm drains to provide adequate drainage if the grade of such roads or accessways is too steep to provide drainage in another manner or if other sufficient reasons exist to require such construction. 
                  g.  All developments shall be constructed and maintained so that adjacent properties are not unreasonably burdened with surface water as a result of such developments. More specifically: 
                  1.  No development may be constructed or maintained so that such development unreasonably impedes the natural flow of water from higher adjacent properties across such development, thereby unreasonably causing substantial damage to such higher adjacent properties; and 
                  2.  No development may be constructed or maintained so that no additional surface waters from such development are channeled onto lower adjacent properties. 
                  (11)  Fire hydrants. In accordance with this chapter, the adequate provision of fire hydrants necessitates that: 
                  a.  Every development subdivided or unsubdivided that is served by a public water system shall include a system of fire hydrants sufficient to provide adequate fire protection for the buildings located or intended to be located within such development. If the development is not served by a public water system, a dry fire hydrant system shall be installed subject to the requirements of this subsection. 
                  b.  The fire hydrants must be located so that all parts of every building within the development may be served by a hydrant by laying not more than 500 feet of hose connected to such hydrant. However, the fire chief of the applicable district may authorize or require a deviation from this standard if in his professional opinion another arrangement more satisfactorily complies with the standard set forth in subsection (11)a. 
                  c.  The fire chief of the applicable district shall determine the precise location of all fire hydrants, subject to the other provisions of this section. In general, fire hydrants shall be placed six feet behind the curbline of publicly dedicated streets that have curb and gutter. 
                  d.  The fire chief of the applicable district shall determine the design standards of all hydrants based on fire flow needs. Unless otherwise specified by the fire chief, all hydrants shall have two 2½-inch hose connections and one 4½-inch hose connection. The 2½-inch hose connection shall be located at least 21½ inches from the ground level. All hydrant threads shall be national standard threads. 
                  e.  Water lines that serve hydrants shall be at least six-inch lines, and, unless no other practicable alternative is available, no such line shall be dead-end lines. 
                  (12)  Street name signs. Street name signs shall be installed at all intersections within a subdivision. The location and design shall be approved by the director. 
                  (13)  Slopes. 
                  a.  No existing or proposed cut or fill shall be deeper than two horizontal units to one vertical unit. 
                  b.  All fill slopes created for the purpose of street or other construction shall have a compaction of not less than 95 percent standard proctor as determined by established engineering practices. 
                  c.  All slopes created or existing within the subdivision or as a result of the subdivision development shall be planted or otherwise protected from erosion and sedimentation failure. 
                  (14)  Topsoil. Topsoil shall not be removed from residential lots or used as spoil, but shall be redistributed so as to provide at least six inches of cover on the lots and at least four inches of cover between sidewalks and curbs, and shall be stabilized by seeding or planting. The excavation and treatment of overburden during construction shall be inspected by the soil conservation office. 
                  (15)  Subdivision entrances. At the preliminary plat stage, the planning commission may limit the number of entrances, driveways, or curb cuts. At the preliminary and final plat stages, the planning commission shall be consistent with all state, federal, and local laws and applicable ordinances, including the state department of transportation rules and all amendments or revisions in effect as of the date of the preliminary plat approval. At the preliminary plat stage, the planning commission may consider safety as well as require available alternatives for adjusting the number of entrances, driveways or curb cuts. 
                  All entrances to residential subdivisions shall be landscaped. 
                  (Ord. No. 48, § 8-2, 1-9-2003; Amend. of 7-12-2007; Amend. of 11-12-2009) 
                  Sec. 34-203. - Underground utilities. 
                  (a)  All electric power lines (not to include transformers or enclosures containing electrical equipment including, but not limited to, switches, meters or capacitors which may be pad mounted), telephone, gas distribution and cable television lines in subdivisions constructed after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall be placed underground in accordance with the specifications and policies of the respective utility service providers. 
                  (b)  Whenever an unsubdivided development is hereafter constructed on a lot that is undeveloped on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, then all electric power, telephone, gas distribution and cable television lines installed to serve the development that are located on the development site outside of a previously existing public street right-of-way shall be placed underground in accordance with the specifications and policies of the respective utility companies. 
                  (Ord. No. 48, § 8-3, 1-9-2003) 
                  Sec. 34-204. - Utilities to be consistent with internal and external development. 
                  (a)  Whenever it can reasonably be anticipated that utility facilities constructed in one development will be extended to serve other adjacent or nearby external developments, such utility facilities (e.g., water or sewer lines) shall be located and constructed so that extensions can be made conveniently and without undue burden or expense or unnecessary duplication of service. 
                  (b)  All utility facilities shall be constructed in such a manner as to minimize interference with pedestrian or vehicular traffic and to facilitate maintenance without undue damage to improvements or facilities located within the development.

                  Sec. 34-205. - As-built drawings required. 
                  Whenever a developer installs or causes to be installed any utility line in any public right-of-way, the developer shall, as soon as practicable after installation is complete, and before acceptance of any water or sewer line, furnish the county with a copy of a drawing in both paper and electronic format that shows the exact location of such utility lines. Such drawings must be verified as accurate by the utility service provider. Compliance with this requirement shall be a condition of the continued validity of the permit authorizing such development. 
                  (Ord. No. 48, § 8-5, 1-9-2003) 
                  Sec. 34-206. - Dedications. 
                  After the adoption of a major street plan as provided by law, the county or other public authority shall not accept, lay out, open, improve, grade, pave or light any street or authorize the laying of water mains, sewers, connections or other facilities or utilities in any street within the territorial jurisdiction of the board of commissioners unless such street has been accepted or opened as, or shall otherwise have received the legal status of, a public street prior to the attachment of the board of commissioner's jurisdiction, or unless such street corresponds in its location and lines with a street shown on a subdivision plat duly approved by the planning commission. The board of commissioners may locate and construct or may accept any other street provided that the ordinance or resolution or other measure for such approval be first submitted to the director and the planning commission for approval or disapproval as provided for in the procedure on plats and, upon approval, any such street shall have the status of an approved street as fully as though it had been originally shown on a subdivision plat duly approved according to this chapter. 
                  (Ord. No. 48, § 8-6, 1-9-2003) 
                  Sec. 34-207. - Private streets. 
                  A street which is not accepted as a public street shall have the status of private street. Private streets may be approved for development only when they are eligible for categorization as a local street. The street shall be designed as to prohibit through traffic. To allow for installation of utilities, there shall be a five-foot utility easement indicated on the plat. Any private street shall be developed to present county standards. Prior to the issuance of building permits for lots within the development, the developer shall file with the director a release of maintenance agreement, releasing the county from any present or future maintenance of the streets. A sign indicating the existence of a private street will be erected at the intersection of each public street and private street. A disclosure statement shall be present on all plats of the subdivision and/or individual lots included in all sales contracts. The statement shall set forth the ownership of the streets, the rights of purchasers and others to use the streets, provisions and responsibilities for maintenance and liability, and rights of purchasers to enforce the provisions. Further, the statement shall advise purchasers that the county is not responsible for the maintenance of private streets. An association with the authority and responsibility to maintain the private streets must be established and approved by the planning commission. The board of commissioners or its designee may require a specific maintenance plan and/or financial guarantee to insure the continued safety and good order of private streets. 
                  (Ord. No. 48, § 8-7, 1-9-2003) 
                  Sec. 34-208. - Access. 
                  The planning commission shall not approve a subdivision in a location where the existing roads providing primary access are inadequate to serve the additional traffic generated by the development. If the ditches on existing county streets are to be used for drainage from the subdivision, the developer will regrade the ditches and provide an all-weather drainage outlet. All regrading and drainage outlets shall be approved by the board of commissioners or its authorized representatives. 
                  (Ord. No. 48, § 8-8, 1-9-2003) 
                  Sec. 34-209. - Permanent reference points. 
                  Prior to the approval of the final plat, all of the subdivision's permanent reference points shall have been placed in accordance with the following requirements: 
                  (1)  Subdivision corner tie. At least one corner of the subdivision shall be designated by course and distance (tie) from a readily discernible reference marker. If a corner is within 2,000 feet of a U.S. Coast and Geodetic Station, U.S. Geological Survey or state grid system coordinated monument, then this corner shall be marked with a monument so designated by computed X and Y coordinates which shall appear on the map with a statement identifying this station or monument to an accuracy of 1:10,000. When such a monument or station is not available, the tie shall be made to some permanent and readily recognizable landmark or identifiable point, physical object or structure. In subdivisions of more than ten lots, the information for this corner tie shall include elevation above sea level making it in effect a benchmark which can be used to determine if individual lots are in a floodprone area. 
                  (2)  Monuments. 
                  a.  Monuments shall be located in the ground at all angles in the boundaries of the subdivision; at the intersection lines of streets and at the intersections of the lines of streets with boundaries of the plat and at the intersection of alleys with the boundaries of the subdivision; at all points of curvature, points in the side lines of streets and alleys; and at all angles of an intermediate traverse line. 
                  b.  It is not intended or required that monuments be placed within the traveled portion of a street to mark angles in the boundary of the subdivision if the angle points can be readily reestablished by reference to monuments along the side lines of the streets. 
                  c.  All required monuments shall be placed flush with the ground where practicable. 
                  d.  If the required location of a monument is in an inaccessible place, or where the location of a monument would be clearly impracticable, it is sufficient to place a reference monument nearby and the precise location thereof shall be clearly indicated on the plat and referenced to the true point. 
                  e.  All monuments used shall be made of a minimum of solid iron or steel bars at least one-half inch in diameter and 24 inches long. 
                  f.  If a point required to be monumented is on a bedrock outcropping, a steel rod at least one-half inch in diameter shall be drilled and grouted into solid rock to a depth of at least eight inches. 
                  (3)  Control corners. Within each block of a subdivision at least two monuments designed and designated as control corners shall be installed. All control corners shall be constructed of concrete and shall be at least four inches in diameter or square and not less than three feet in length. Each monument shall have imbedded in its top or attached by a suitable means, a metal plate of noncorrosive materials and marked plainly with the point, the surveyor's registration number, the month and year it was installed and the words "control corner." 
                  (4)  Property marker. A steel or wrought iron pipe or the equivalent not less than one-half inch in diameter and at least 24 inches in length shall set all corners, except those located by monuments. 
                  (5)  Accuracy. Land surveys, both within the limits of incorporated areas and beyond shall be at an accuracy of at least 1:7,500.

                  Sec. 34-241. - Scope. 
                  The design standards contained in this article shall apply to all new development and they shall conform to the minimum requirements of the property's zoning designation as required in this chapter. 
                  (Ord. No. 48, § 9-1, 1-9-2003) 
                  Sec. 34-242. - Streets. 
                  Streets shall conform to current county road construction and maintenance specifications. 
                  (1)  Conformity to existing maps or plans. The location and width of all proposed streets shall be in conformity with official plans and maps and with existing amended plans of the planning commission. 
                  (2)  Continuation of adjoining street system. The proposed street layout shall be coordinated with the street system of the surrounding area. Where possible, existing major streets shall be extended. 
                  (3)  Access to adjacent properties. Where it is desirable to provide for street access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundary of such property and a temporary turnaround of a 30-foot radius shall be provided. Houses fronting on minor streets shall have access from minor streets only. 
                  (4)  Entrances to streets. All driveway entrances and other openings onto streets within the county's jurisdiction shall be constructed so that: 
                  a.  The vehicles can enter and exit from the lot in question without posing any substantial danger to themselves, pedestrians, or vehicles travelling in abutting streets; 
                  b.  Interference with the free and convenient flow of traffic in abutting or surrounding streets is minimized; 
                  c.  Vehicular access from properties to streets shall not exceed 30 feet in width; 
                  d.  No more than two points of vehicular ingress/egress from a property to each abutting public street shall be permitted for each 400 feet of lot frontage, or fraction thereof; provided, however, that lots with less than 100 feet of frontage shall have no more than one point of ingress/egress to any one public street; 
                  e.  No point of ingress/egress shall be allowed within 35 feet of the right-of-way line of any street intersection; 
                  f.  No curbs on county roads or rights-of-way shall be cut or altered for ingress/egress without approval of the county road department; 
                  g.  An ingress/egress driveway shall be located not closer than 30 feet to another such driveway on the same street. 
                  (5)  Street names. Proposed streets, which are obviously in alignment with other existing and named streets, shall bear the assigned name of the existing streets. In no case shall the name of the proposed streets duplicate or be phonetically similar to existing street names, regardless of the use of suffix, street, avenue, boulevard, drive, place, court, etc. It shall be unlawful for any person in laying out any new street or road to name such street or road on any plat, by marking or in any deed or instrument, without first getting approval of the director or his designee. 
                  (6)  Local streets. Local streets shall be so laid out that their use by through-traffic will be discouraged. 
                  (7)  Trees. It is recommended that as many trees as possible remain on the site during the initial clearing and grading and that trees normally remain unless they lie within a planned public right-of-way, within a planned building site or within the necessary paved area surrounding or adjacent to the primary structure. 
                  (8)  Railroads and highways (freeways, expressways). Railroad rights-of-way and limited access highways where so located as to affect the subdivision of adjoining lands shall be treated as follows: 
                  a.  In the residential district a buffer strip not less than 25 feet in depth in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall be provided adjacent to the railroad rights-of-way or limited access highways. This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be so designated on the plat: "This strip is reserved for the planting of trees and shrubs by the owner. The placement of structures hereon is prohibited." 
                  b.  In districts zoned for commercial or industrial uses, the nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad shall be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites. 
                  c.  All other streets which are parallel to the railroad, when intersecting a street which crosses the railroad at grade, shall, to the extent practicable, be at a distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients. 
                  (9)  Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets by less than 125 feet shall be prohibited. 
                  (10)  Right angle intersections. Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as practicable. 
                  (11)  Cul-de-sac. A minor street not to extend more than 1,200 feet in length and provided with a turnaround having a minimum roadway diameter of at least 80 feet, a maximum roadway diameter of 200 feet, and a right-of-way diameter of at least 100 feet. Turnarounds having a roadway diameter of 200 feet shall include a landscaped area, a minimum of 100 feet in diameter in the center of the turnaround. Temporary dead-end streets shall be provided with a turnaround having a 30-foot radius. See subsection 34-247(3) for radial lots. 
                  (12)  Alley. Service alleys or drives may be required in multiple dwelling, commercial and industrial developments and shall have a minimum surface treatment width of 15 feet, but shall not be provided in one-family and two-family residential developments unless the subdivider provides evidence satisfactory to the planning commission of the need for alleys. 
                  (13)  Street right-of-way widths. For street right-of-way widths, reference County Ordinance No. 5. If County Ordinance No. 5 requires more restrictive standards than those standards enumerated in this section, then the provisions of that ordinance shall govern. Street rights-of-way are designed and developed to serve several functions: (i) to carry motor vehicle traffic, and in some cases, allow on-street parking: (ii) to provide a safe and convenient passageway for pedestrian traffic; and (iii) to serve as an important link in the county's drainage system. In order to fulfill these objectives, minimum street right-of-way widths shall be as follows: 
                  _____ 
                  In order to fulfill these objectives, minimum street right-of-way widths shall be as follows: 
                  Curb and gutter type construction: 

                   
                  Shoulder-type lane construction: 

                   
                  * Includes 60 feet of right-of-way and five feet on each side for utility easements. 
                  Inverted crown type construction: 

                   
                  1.  When inverted crown is used the minimum grade shall not be less than one-half of one percent. 
                  2.  Except for local streets, roadway widths shown do not provide for on-street parking; service lanes are intended only for loading and unloading of passengers and goods and for disabled vehicles and not for the storage of vehicles. 
                  3.  Right-of-way width listed is for only that portion of the typical section between the limits indicated in diagram. Sloping rights of additional right-of-way will be required for cut and fill slopes outside these limits; these future slope areas beyond indicated right-of-way limits should also be kept clear of development until slopes have been constructed. 
                  4.  Right-of-way widths greater than minimum are encouraged because they make for a safer, more aesthetic and more "comfortable" facility and permit future roadway widening without disrupting abutting property. 
                  (14)  Sight distance for vertical curves. Where vertical curves are used, the minimum sight distance shall be as follows: 

                   
                  (15)  Horizontal curves. Where a deflection angle of more than ten degrees occur in the alignment of a marginal access or local street or road, a curve of reasonable radius shall be introduced. A curve shall be introduced at any change in direction of a collector, commercial or industrial service street or major thoroughfare. On major thoroughfares the centerline radius of curvature shall be determined by the state department of transportation or county road superintendent. On collector, commercial or industrial service streets, the centerline radius of curvature shall not be less than 350 feet. On local streets, the centerline radius of curvature shall not be less than 150 feet unless the topography of the land to be subdivided makes this impractical. 
                  (16)  Relationship of streets to topography. Streets shall be related appropriately to the topography. In particular, streets shall be designed to facilitate the drainage and stormwater runoff objectives set forth in this chapter and street grades shall conform as closely as practicable to the original topography. 
                  (17)  Street grades. Grades on major thoroughfares shall be established by the state department of transportation or county road superintendent. Grades on collector streets shall not exceed eight percent unless topographic conditions make this impractical. Grades on local streets shall not exceed 15 percent, unless topographic conditions make this impractical. All streets should have a minimum grade of not less than one-half of one percent. 
                  (18)  Access to arterial roads. When a subdivision is proposed with frontage along an existing arterial road, or state numbered highway, every attempt must be made to provide an access road or frontage road for direct access to the proposed lots. The planning commission shall evaluate this requirement in an attempt to reduce the number and frequency of curb cuts along arterial roads and state numbered highways. Where a driveway or curb cut along a state highway is necessary, approval from the state department of transportation must be submitted when the preliminary subdivision plat is submitted to the department of planning and zoning for approval.

                  (a)  Within unsubdivided developments, all private streets and accessways shall be designed and constructed to facilitate the safe and convenient movement of motor vehicle and pedestrian traffic. 
                  (b)  Whenever a road in an unsubdivided development connects two or more collector or arterial streets in such a manner that any substantial volume of through traffic is likely to make use of this road, such road shall be constructed in accordance with the standards applicable to subdivision streets and shall be dedicated. In other cases when roads in unsubdivided developments within the county are constructed in accordance with the specifications for subdivision streets, the county may accept an offer of dedication of such streets. 
                  (c)  In all unsubdivided residential developments, sidewalks shall be provided linking dwelling units with other dwelling units, the public street and on-site activity centers such as parking areas, laundry facilities and recreational areas and facilities. 
                  (d)  Whenever the permit-issuing authority finds that a means of pedestrian access is necessary from an unsubdivided development to schools, parks, playgrounds or other roads or facilities and that such access is not conveniently provided by sidewalks adjacent to the roads, the developer may be required to reserve an unobstructed easement of at least ten feet to provide such access. 
                  (e)  The sidewalks required by this section shall be at least four feet wide and constructed according to the specifications set forth in section 34-246, except that the permit-issuing authority may permit the installation of walkways constructed with other suitable materials when it concludes that: 
                  (1)  Such walkways would serve the residents of the development as adequately as concrete sidewalks; and 
                  (2)  Such walkways could be more environmentally desirable or more in keeping with the overall design of the development.

                  The sidewalks in subdivisions shall be at least four feet in width and sidewalk construction shall be similar to street construction, with subgrade compacted to 100 percent AASHTO T99. Concrete sidewalks shall be four inches thick (increasing to six inches thick at driveway entrances). Expansion joints shall be provided every 30 feet, and false joints every ten feet. However, the permit-issuing authority may permit the installation of walkways constructed with other suitable materials when it concludes that: 
                  (1)  Such walkways would serve the residents of the development as adequately as concrete sidewalks; and 
                  (2)  Such walkways would be more environmentally desirable or more in keeping with the overall design of the development. 
                  Whenever the permit-issuing authority finds that a means of pedestrian access is necessary from the subdivision to schools, parks, playgrounds or other roads or facilities and that such access is not conveniently provided by sidewalks adjacent to the streets, the developer may be required to reserve an unobstructed easement of at least ten feet in width to provide such access.

                  Sec. 34-284. - Preservation of natural features and amenities. 
                  (a)  Generally. In all new development or construction, no trees with a diameter of six inches or over, measured 4½ feet above ground level shall be taken down, damaged or destroyed without prior written approval of the planning commission. Limits of root damage shall be taken into consideration prior to such approval. Trees with a diameter of six inches or over and located in buffer or setback areas shall be shown on development and/or building site plans. It shall be the intent of this section to retain as many trees as possible for the visual attractiveness, natural preservation and energy conservation benefit gained by doing so. This provision shall not apply to individual owner-occupied parcels of land. Existing features that would add value to residential development or to the local government as a whole, such as trees, as herein defined, watercourses and falls, beaches, historic spots, and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be preserved in the design of the subdivision. No trees shall be removed from any subdivision nor any change of grade of the land effected until approval of the preliminary plat has been granted. All trees on the plat required to be retained shall be preserved, and all trees where required shall be welled and protected against change of grade. The preliminary plat shall show the number and location of existing trees as required by these regulations and shall further indicate all those marked for retention. 
                  (b)  Shade trees planted by developer. As a requirement of subdivision approval, where the development is not naturally wooded, the applicant shall plant shade trees on the property within the subdivision from the entrance to the subdivision to the first lot along that street. Trees are to be planted within five feet of the right-of-way of the road within and abutting the subdivision. One tree shall be planted for every 40 feet of frontage along each road from the entrance to the subdivision to the first lot. New trees shall have a minimum trunk diameter (measured 12 inches above the ground level) of not less than two inches. Only long-lived shade trees shall be planted. 
                  (c)  Maintenance of planted trees. The developer shall be responsible for replacing any tree that dies within one year of the completion of the entire development or, if a phased development, within one year of the completion of the phase in which the now dead tree was planted. 
                  (d)  Common areas. A disclosure statement shall be present on all plats of the subdivision and/or individual lots and shall be included in the sales contract. This statement shall set forth the ownership of common areas, the rights of purchasers and others to use common areas, provisions and responsibilities for the maintenance and liability, and rights of purchasers to enforce such provisions. Further, the disclosure statement shall advise purchasers that the county is not responsible for the maintenance of such common areas. An alternative, which must be approved by the planning commission on a project by project basis, is the establishment of a responsible association with the authority to maintain the common areas. 
                  (e)  Open space recommended: In residential subdivisions, as defined in this chapter, with greater than 60 lots averaging less than one acre per lot, an area up to ten percent of the land area of the subdivision may be set aside as protected greenspace.

                  Sec. 34-311. - Improvements and subdivision improvement agreement. 
                  (a)  Completion of improvements. Before the final subdivision plat is signed by the planning commission, all applicants shall be required to complete, in accordance with the planning commission's decision and to the satisfaction of the county engineer, all the street, sanitary and other public improvements, including lot improvements on the individual lots of the subdivision, as required in these regulations, specified in the final subdivision plat and as approved by the planning commission, and to dedicate those public improvements to the local government, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances on the dedicated property and public improvements. 
                  (b)  Subdivision improvement agreement and guarantee. 
                  (1)  Agreement. The board of commissioners at its sole discretion may waive the requirement that the applicant complete and dedicate all public improvements prior to approval of the final subdivision plat and, as an alternative, permit the applicant to enter into a subdivision improvement agreement by which the subdivider covenants to complete all required public improvements in accordance with the Lincoln County Code and approved plans and specifications no later than one year following the date on which the planning commission signs the final subdivision plat. The applicant shall covenant to maintain each required public improvement for a period of one year following the acceptance by the board of commissioners of the dedication of that completed public improvement and also shall warrant that all required public improvements will be free from defect for a period of two years following the acceptance by the board of commissioners of the dedication of the last completed public improvement. Planted trees must be guaranteed in accordance with section 34-284. The subdivision improvement agreement shall contain such other terms and conditions agreed to by the applicant and the board of commissioners. 
                  (2)  Covenants to run. The subdivision improvement agreement shall provide that the covenants contained in the agreement shall run with the land and bind all successors, heirs and assignees of the subdivider. The subdivision improvement agreement will be adopted by the board of commissioners, pursuant to applicable state and local laws, and shall be recorded in the clerk's office of the superior court of the county. 
                  (3)  Security. Whenever the board of commissioners permits an applicant to enter into a subdivision improvement agreement, it shall require the applicant to provide a letter of credit, cash escrow, or performance bond. as security for the promises contained in the subdivision improvement agreement. The form of such security shall be as approved by the county attorney. Either security shall be in an amount not less than 120 percent of the estimated cost of completion of the required public improvements, including lot improvements and such other subdivision improvements as are necessary to protect the health, safety, or general welfare of the subdivision residents and other residents of Lincoln County, or in such other amount as the planning commission at its sole discretion determines is necessary as security. The issuer of the letter of credit, the escrow agent, or the surety on the bond, as applicable, shall be acceptable to the board of commissioners. If construction of the subdivision improvements has not begun within one year of the date the final subdivision plat was recorded, the board of commissioners reserves the right to require the subdivider to modify the approved plans and specifications to reflect any changes made in the Lincoln County Code and to increase the security for the faithful performance of the agreement. 
                  a.  Letter of credit. If the applicant posts a letter of credit as security for the promises contained in the subdivision improvement agreement, the credit shall: 
                  1.  Be irrevocable; 
                  2.  Be for a term sufficient to cover the completion, maintenance and warranty periods in subsection (b)(1) of this section; and 
                  3.  Require only that the government present the credit with a sight draft and an affidavit signed by the county attorney attesting to the county's right to draw funds under the credit. 
                  b.  Cash escrow. If the applicant posts a cash escrow as security for its promises contained in the subdivision improvement agreement, the escrow instructions shall provide that: 
                  1.  The subdivider will have no right to return of any of the funds except as provided in section 34-312(b)(2); and 
                  2.  The escrow agent shall have a legal duty to deliver the funds to the county whenever the county attorney presents an affidavit to the agent attesting to the county's right to receive funds whether or not the subdivider protests that right. 
                  c.  Bond. If the applicant posts a performance bond as security for the promises contained in the subdivision improvement agreement, the bond shall: 
                  1.  Be irrevocable; 
                  2.  Be for a term sufficient to cover the completion, maintenance and warranty periods in subsection (b)(1) of this section; and 
                  3.  Require only that the government present the surety with notice signed by the county attorney of the principal's breach of the subdivision improvement agreement. 
                  4.  Should the government be notified that the surety becomes insolvent or otherwise shall no longer act as surety, the subdivider shall replace the bond with a new surety or provide other security as provided herein, within ten days after receiving notice from the government that the surety will no longer guarantee performance under the bond. 
                  If and when the county accepts the offer of dedication for the last completed required public improvement, the county shall execute a waiver of its right to receive all but 25 percent of the funds represented by the letter of credit, cash escrow, or bond if the subdivider is not in breach of the subdivision improvement agreement. The residual funds shall be security for the subdivider's covenant to maintain the required public improvements and its warranty that the improvements are free from defect. 
                  (4)  Extension. In the event that it is deemed necessary to extend the time for completion of the improvements, an extension may be granted by the board of commissioners and shall in no way affect the terms of the subdivision improvement agreement or release the security given for the faithful performance of the agreement. Extensions shall not exceed 18 months, shall be in writing, approved by the board of commissioners, and signed by the subdivider and county. Any request for extension shall be made by the subdivider no later than 60 days prior to the expiration of the subdivision improvement agreement. In consideration of a subdivision improvement agreement extension, the following may be required: 
                  a.  Revision of improvement plans to provide for current design and construction standards when required by the county engineer; 
                  b.  Revised improvement construction estimates to reflect current improvement costs as approved by the county engineer; 
                  c.  Increase of improvement security in accordance with revised construction estimates or if it is determined by the county engineer that work has not proceeded in a diligent manner; 
                  d.  Inspection fees may be increased to reflect current construction costs but shall not be subject to any decrease or refund; 
                  e.  Any additional requirements imposed by the board of commissioners, as recommended by the county engineer, or as deemed necessary as a condition to approving any time extension for the completion of improvements; 
                  f.  Payment of costs incurred by the county including any engineering fees, legal costs, and attorney's fees, as a result of the subdivider's failure to timely complete the improvements; and 
                  g.  Suspend final subdivision plat approval during which time the subdivider will have no right to sell, transfer or otherwise convey lots or homes with the subdivision without the express written approval of the county, or until the improvements are completed and accepted by the county. 
                  (c)  Costs of improvements. All required improvements shall be made by the developer, at his expense, without reimbursement by the local government. 
                  (d)  Failure to complete improvement. Where a subdivision improvement agreement has been executed and security has been posted and required public improvements have not been installed within the terms of the agreement, or satisfactory progress has not been made on the improvements, the local government may then: 
                  (1)  Declare the agreement to be in default and require that all the improvements be installed regardless of the extent of the building development at the time the agreement is declared to be in default; 
                  (2)  Suspend final subdivision plat approval until the improvements are completed and record a document to that effect for the purpose of public notice; 
                  (3)  Withhold issuance of building permits and certificates of occupancy within the subdivision; 
                  (4)  Obtain funds under the security and use the proceeds for engineering expenses, consultants' fees and charges, legal fees and costs, or other expenses, to complete improvements itself or through a third party; 
                  (5)  Assign its right to receive funds under the security to any third party, including a subsequent owner of the subdivision for which improvements were not constructed, in whole or in part, in exchange for that subsequent owners agreement to complete improvements in the subdivision; and 
                  (6)  Exercise any other rights available under the law. 
                  The subdivider hereby grants to the county, its assigns, agents, contractors, and employees, a nonexclusive right and easement to enter the property for the purposes of constructing, maintaining, and repairing such improvements. 
                  Should the cost of completing the improvements exceed the amount available under the faithful performance guarantee, subdivider agrees to pay such excess amount to the county on demand. County shall not accept or assume any responsibility for construction, operation, or maintenance of the subdivision improvements until final completion and acceptance by the county, and no representation or forbearance by any officer or agent of the county to the contrary shall obligate the county or constitute acceptance of the improvements. Further, the public's use of such improvements prior to final completion and acceptance by deed of dedication shall not constitute an implied dedication of such improvements to the county. 
                  (e)  Acceptance of dedication offers. Acceptance of formal offers of dedication of streets, public areas, easements, and parks shall be by ordinance of the board of commissioners. The approval of a subdivision plat by the planning commission, whether preliminary or final, shall not be deemed to constitute or imply the acceptance by the county of any street, easement, or park shown on the plat.

                  Sec. 34-312. - Inspection of improvements. 
                  (a)  General procedure and fees. The board of commissioners shall provide for inspection of required improvements during construction and ensure their satisfactory completion. The applicant shall pay to the county an inspection fee based on the estimated cost of inspection, and where the improvements are completed prior to final plat approval, the subdivision plat shall not be signed by the planning commission unless the inspection fee has been paid at the time of application. These fees shall be due and payable upon demand of the county and no building permits or certificates of occupancy shall be issued until all fees are paid. If the director finds upon inspection that any one or more of the required improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the county's construction standards and specifications, the applicant shall be responsible for properly completing the improvements. 
                  (b)  Release or reduction of security. 
                  (1)  Certificate of satisfactory completion. The board of commissioners will not accept dedication of required improvements, nor release nor reduce the amount of any security posted by the subdivider until the county engineer has submitted a certificate stating that all required improvements have been satisfactorily completed and until: 
                  a.  The applicant's engineer or surveyor has certified to the county engineer, through submission of a detailed as-built survey plat of the subdivision, indicating location, dimension, materials, and other information required by the planning commission or board of commissioners, that the layout of the line and grade of all public improvements is in accordance with construction plans for the subdivision; and 
                  b.  A title insurance policy has been furnished to and approved by the county attorney indicating that the improvements have been completed, are ready for dedication to the local government, and are free and clear of any and all liens and encumbrances. 
                  Upon such approval and recommendation by the county attorney, the board of commissioners shall thereafter accept the improvements for dedication in accordance with the established procedure. 
                  (2)  Reduction of escrowed funds and security. 
                  a.  If the security posted by the subdivider was a cash escrow, the amount of the escrow shall be reduced upon actual acceptance of the dedication of public improvements and then only to the ratio that the cost of the public improvement for which dedication was accepted bears to the total cost of public improvements for the subdivision. In no event shall a cash escrow be reduced below 25 percent of the principal amount. Funds held in escrow account shall not be released to the subdivider, in whole or in part, except upon express written instruction of the county attorney. At the end of the maintenance and warranty periods, all escrowed funds, if any, shall be released to the subdivider. 
                  b.  If the security provided by the subdivider was a letter of credit, the county attorney shall execute waivers of the county's right to draw funds under the credit upon actual acceptance of the dedication of public improvements and then only to the ratio that the cost of the public improvement for which dedication was accepted bears to the total cost of public improvements for the subdivision. In no event shall waivers be executed that would reduce the security below 25 percent of its original amount. 
                  c.  If the security provided by the subdivider was a bond, the county attorney shall execute waivers of the county's right to draw funds under the bond upon actual acceptance of the dedication of public improvements and then only to the ratio that the cost of the public improvement for which dedication was accepted bears to the total cost of public improvements for the subdivision. In no event shall waivers be executed that would reduce the security below 25 percent of its original amount.

                  Sec. 34-313. - Escrow deposits for lot improvements. 
                  (a)  Acceptance of escrow funds. Whenever, by reason of the season of the year, any lot improvement required by the subdivision regulations cannot be performed, the director may issue a certificate of occupancy, provided there is no danger to health, safety, or general welfare, upon accepting a cash escrow deposit in an amount to be determined by the board of commissioners for the cost of the lot improvements. The subdivision improvement agreement and security covering the lot improvements shall remain in full force and effect. 
                  (b)  Procedures on escrow fund. All required improvements for which escrow monies have been accepted by the director at the time of issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall be installed by the subdivider within a period of nine months from the date of deposit and issuance of the certificate of occupancy. If the improvements have not been properly installed at the end of the time period, the director shall give two weeks written notice to the developer requiring him to install the improvements, and if they are not then installed properly, the director may request the board of commissioners to proceed to contract out the work for the installation of the necessary improvements in a sum not to exceed the amount of the escrow deposit. At the time of the issuance of the certificate of occupancy for which escrow monies are being deposited with the director, the developer shall obtain and file with the building official prior to obtaining the certificate of occupancy a notarized statement from the purchaser of the premises authorizing the building official to install or have installed the improvements at the end of the nine-month period if the improvements have not been duly installed by the subdivider.

                  The developer shall be required to maintain all required public improvements on the individual subdivided lots until acceptance of the improvements by the board of commissioners. If there are any certificates of occupancy on a street not dedicated to the county, the county may effect emergency repairs and charge those costs to the developer. Following the acceptance of the dedication of any public improvement by the county, the board of commissioners may, in its sole discretion require the subdivider to maintain the improvement for a period of one year from the date of acceptance.

                  Sec. 34-315. - Deferral of waiver of requirement improvements. 
                  (a)  The board of commissioners may defer or waive at the time of final approval, subject to appropriate condition, the provision of any or all public improvements as, in its judgment, are not requisite in the interests of the public health, safety, and general welfare, or which are inappropriate because of the inadequacy or in existence of connecting facilities. Any determination to defer or waive the provision of any public improvement must be made on the record and the reasons for the deferral or waiver also shall be expressly made on the record. 
                  (b)  Whenever it is deemed necessary by the board of commissioners to defer the construction of any improvement required under these regulations because of incompatible grades, future planning, inadequate or nonexistent connecting facilities, or for other reasons, the subdivider shall pay his share of the costs of the future improvements to the local government prior to signing of the final subdivision plat by the planning commission, or the developer may execute a separate subdivision improvement agreement secured by a letter of credit guaranteeing completion of the deferred improvements upon demand of the county.

                  (a)  When a subdivision improvement agreement and security have been required for a subdivision, no certificate of occupancy for any building in the subdivision shall be issued prior to the completion of the required public improvements and the acceptance of the dedication of those improvements by the county, as required in the planning commission approval of the final subdivision plat. 
                  (b)  The extent of street improvements shall be adequate for vehicular access by the prospective occupant and by police and fire equipment prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit. The developer shall, at the time of the offer of dedication, submit monies in escrow to the county in a sum determined by the planning commission to cover the cost of the necessary final improvement of the street. 
                  (c)  No building permit shall be issued for the final ten percent of lots in a subdivision, or if ten percent is less than two, for the final two lots of a subdivision, until all public improvements required by the planning commission for the subdivision have been fully completed and the local government has accepted the developer's offers to dedicate the improvements.

                  Sec. 34-381. - Appeals. 
                  The planning commission shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by the appellant that there is an error in any order, requirement, permit, decision or refusal made by the director or other administrative official in the administration or enforcement of any provisions of this chapter. Such appeals shall be in accordance with the following: 
                  (1)  Appeals. An appeal to the planning commission may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any governmental officer, department, board or agency affected by any decision of the director or other administrative official with respect to this chapter. Such appeal shall be made within 15 days following notification of the decision appealed from, by filing with the planning commission, a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The director shall forthwith transmit to the planning commission all the papers constituting the record upon which the action was taken. 
                  (2)  Stay of proceedings. An appeal stays all actions by the director seeking enforcement of or compliance with the order or decision appealed from, unless the director certifies to the planning commission that a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by a court of competent jurisdiction. 
                  (3)  Evidence. The appellant and any public agency or private individual shall be entitled to present evidence on matters before the planning commission at the public hearing as required in section 34-384. 
                  (4)  Power of planning commission. The planning commission, in conformity with this chapter, may modify in whole or in part any order, requirement or decision of the director and to that end shall have the power of the director or administrative official from whom the appeal is taken. The planning commission may direct the issuance of a permit. It shall be the duty of the director to carry out the decisions of the planning commission. 
                  (Ord. No. 48, § 13-1, 1-9-2003) 
                  Sec. 34-382. - Special uses. 
                  Some zoning districts permit certain uses only upon approval of the planning commission. These uses are identified in this chapter as special uses and such uses may be allowed under special conditions. The granting of a special use does not constitute a permanent change in zoning or use. The special use may be forfeited if it does not meet the criteria provided in this section. Generally, a special use shall be compatible with the applicable zoning district under special conditions. 
                  (1)  Special use approval. Special uses shall be permitted subject to an approval by the planning commission according to procedures established in section 34-384. The required review shall determine whether the uses conform to the standards set forth in subsection (2) of this section. 
                  (2)  Special use standards. The special use shall be approved if it meets all the following factors: 
                  a.  A rezoning to a more intensive zoning district, which contains that use as a use by right, would not be appropriate for the property. 
                  b.  The location and character of the special use shall be compatible with the community development pattern and consistent with the needs of the neighborhood. 
                  c.  The special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of the natural environment or of other property in the immediate vicinity, or diminish and impair property values within the surrounding neighborhood. 
                  d.  The special use will not increase state or local expenditures in relation to the cost of servicing or maintaining neighborhood properties. 
                  (3)  Additional conditions and development standards. The planning commission may impose any additional conditions and development standards, along with the grant of the special use, as may be necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of surrounding landowners, neighborhoods and workers. The planning commission may require as part of its approval, the following conditions: 
                  a.  Planted or screen buffers to reduce adverse or potentially adverse effects on adjoining properties. 
                  b.  Limitation of street accessways, parking areas and loading docks. 
                  c.  The rearrangement of structures on the development site. 
                  d.  Increases in maximum building height. 
                  e.  Increases in the district requirements for lot size and building line setbacks, but not a reduction of these requirements. 
                  f.  Limitations on the hours of business operation when it can be shown that proposed operational times would cause an adverse effect on adjoining, existing uses. 
                  g.  Specified distances from existing residential, public, or institutional developments. 
                  In no case, however, shall the planning commission exempt any special use from meeting the minimum lot and structure requirements of the zoning district in which the proposed use is to be located. 
                  (Ord. No. 48, § 13-2, 1-9-2003) 
                  Sec. 34-383. - Variances. 
                  (a)  The planning commission shall hear and recommend to the board of commissioners applications for variances from the requirements of this chapter, but only in individual cases of practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship. This includes exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific piece of property, which at the time of adoption of this chapter, was a lot or plat of record; or where, by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary or exceptional conditions of a piece of property, the strict application of the said development requirements of this chapter would result in practical difficulties to, or undue hardship upon, the owner of such property. However, the planning commission shall not be authorized to recommend a density variance or a use variance to permit a use in a district in which the use is prohibited. 
                  (b)  No variance shall be recommended unless the planning commission finds that all of the following conditions exist: 
                  (1)  The special circumstances or conditions applying to the building or land in question are peculiar to the land involved and do not apply generally to other land or buildings in the vicinity. 
                  (2)  The strict application of the ordinance to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship by depriving the applicant of any reasonable use of his land. Mere loss in value shall not justify a variance from this chapter. There must be a deprivation of the beneficial use of land. 
                  (3)  The condition from which relief of a variance is sought did not result from action by the applicant. 
                  (4)  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of this chapter, provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited in a given district by this chapter. 
                  (c)  In reviewing an application for a variance, the burden of showing that the variance should be granted shall be upon the person applying thereof. Additional provisions are as follows: 
                  (1)  Review and approval of request; conditions. The planning commission when making a recommendation on a variance request, or the board of commissioners when granting a variance, may establish reasonable conditions concerning the use of such property and may establish a time period for the variance so that the purpose of this chapter will be served and to provide adequately for the maintenance of the integrity and character of the zoning district in which such permit is granted. 
                  (2)  Review and approval of request; guarantees. When necessary, the planning commission may recommend and the board of commissioners may require guarantees, in such form as it deems proper, to insure that conditions designated in connection therewith are being or will be complied with. Where any condition under which a request has been granted appears to have been violated, the planning commission may hold a public hearing thereon to determine whether or not the permit theretofore granted shall be terminated. 
                  (3)  Subdivisions. The planning commission may recommend, and the board of commissioners may grant variances from the required improvements and minimum standards of design contained in sections 34-201—34-209 and 34-241—34-248; provided the subdivider makes a specific request and shows to the satisfaction of the planning commission and the board of commissioners that topographical or other conditions peculiar and particular to the site are such that strict adherence to the requirements would cause him unnecessary hardship and would not carry out the intent of this chapter. 
                  (4)  Time limit for recommendation. The planning commission shall consider and decide whether to recommend approval or disapproval of a variance request within 45 days after the public hearing, as specified in section 34-384, in accordance with the standards set forth in section 34-382. 
                  (5)  Recommendation recorded in minutes; termination of variance. The recommendation of approval or disapproval of a variance request by the planning commission, and the grant of a variance by the board of commissioners shall be stated in the minutes with the reasons for departure from the strict application of the ordinance and the conditions under which the variance was granted. Any variance granted shall terminate automatically when the use ceases to be in full compliance with any conditions imposed by the board of commissioners, when the use has been abandoned or when the building permit shall have expired.

                  Sec. 34-384. - Public hearings. 
                  After receiving an application for an appeal, variance or special use, the planning commission shall schedule a public hearing. 
                  (1)  Application. The application and fee determined by the county for a hearing and decision on requests for an appeal, variance or special use shall be filed with the director on forms provided by the county at least 30 days prior to the next scheduled planning commission meeting. Each application shall contain such information as the director may require to enable the planning commission to make its decision on an appeal or special use, or a recommendation on a variance request. 
                  (2)  Notice of hearing. The planning commission shall publish once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county, a written notice of such public hearing at least 15 days but not more than 45 days prior to the public hearing. The public notice shall indicate the time, place and nature of the appeal, variance or special use to be considered by the planning commission. Upon the hearing any party may appear in person, or by agent, or by attorney. The cost of such newspaper notice shall be paid by the applicant. 
                  Additionally, at least 15 days before the scheduled public hearing, the director shall post, in a conspicuous place on the property a sign at least two feet by three feet in size. It shall set forth the time, place and purpose of the public hearing before the planning commission. Acts of vandalism or natural occurrences limiting the effectiveness of notice by a sign posted on the property shall not invalidate any proceedings or action taken under this article.

                  Sec. 34-422. - Building permits required. 
                  (a)  It shall be unlawful to commence the excavation for or the construction of any building or structure including accessory structures, or to commence the moving, alteration or repair of any structure including accessory structures, until the director or designee has issued for such work a building permit containing a statement that the plans, specifications and intended use of such structure in all respects conform with the provisions of this chapter. 
                  (b)  No building permit shall be issued for the construction of any building or structure located on a lot or plat subdivided or sold in violation of the provisions of this chapter.

                  Sec. 34-423. - Application for building permit. 
                  (a)  Application for a building permit shall be made in writing to the director of planning and zoning on forms provided for that purpose. It shall be unlawful for the director of planning and zoning to approve the plans or issue a building permit for any excavation or construction until he has inspected such plans in detail and found them to be in conformity with this chapter. To this end, the director of planning and zoning may require that every application for a building permit for excavation, construction, moving or alteration shall be accompanied by a plan or plat drawn to scale and showing the following in sufficient detail to enable the director of planning and zoning to ascertain whether the proposed excavation, construction, moving or alteration is in conformance with this chapter. The plat shall include: 
                  (1)  The actual shape, location and dimensions of the lot to be built upon. 
                  (2)  The shape, height, use and location on the lot, building or structures to be erected or altered.

                  (8)  Such other information concerning the lot or adjoining lots as may be essential in determining whether the provisions of this chapter and any applicable subdivision improvement agreement are being observed. 
                  (b)  If the proposed excavation, construction, moving or alteration as set forth in the application for a building permit is in conformity with the provisions of this chapter and any applicable subdivision improvement agreement, the director of planning and zoning shall issue a building permit for such excavation, construction, moving or alteration. If the application for a building permit is not approved, the director of planning and zoning shall state in writing on the application the cause for such disapproval. Issuance of a permit shall, in no case, be construed as waiving any provision of this chapter, and building permits shall be void after twelve months from date of issuance. If substantial progress on the project has been made by that time, an extension of the permit may be granted.

A certificate of occupancy shall be issued in accordance to the provisions of this chapter. If the certificate of occupancy is not granted upon request, the director of planning and zoning shall state in writing the reasons why the certificate was not granted.

                  (b)  Transfer or sale before approval prohibited.

                  Sec. 34-462. - Continuance of nonconforming uses. 
                  The lawful use of any building, structure, or land existing at the time of the enactment or subsequent amendment of this chapter may be continued even though such use does not conform with provisions of this chapter except that the nonconforming structure or use shall not be: 
                  (1)  Changed to another nonconforming use; 
                  (2)  Reestablished after discontinuance for one year; 
                  (3)  Extended or enlarged beyond its size at the time the structure or use became nonconforming. This includes, but is not limited to, the size of the building, the number of employees, operation during other hours of the day or night, the use of additional land and additional or more powerful equipment; or 
                  (4)  Rebuilt, altered, repaired or replaced after incurring damages exceeding 75 percent of its replacement cost at the time or condition except in conformity with this chapter. A nonconforming manufactured home may not be replaced with another manufactured home unless it is in compliance with all requirements of this chapter. 
                  Additionally, a nonconforming manufactured home use may be continued in any zoning district except R-1 by replacement for any reason, provided that the new manufactured home: 
                  (1)  Was not manufactured more than five years prior to the permit application date; 
                  (2)  Conforms to all other requirements for manufactured homes contained in articles XVII and XVIII of this code. 
                  Nothing in this article shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to safe condition of any building or part thereof, where the damage incurred is less than 75 percent of the replacement cost, declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official.

                  Sec. 34-463. - Temporary nonconforming uses. 
                  (a)  The director of planning and zoning shall have the authority to issue a temporary use permit allowing a modular office, manufactured home or travel trailer to be placed on an individual lot for a nonresidential use where the applicant for such permit shows that it is necessary to use such modular office, manufactured home or travel trailer as an office or work area for the preparation and completion of a construction project. 
                  (b)  The planning commission may authorize the director of planning and zoning to issue a temporary medical hardship permit for a single-wide manufactured home, unless the disability requires a larger manufactured home, on a lot with a minimum lot size of two acres, and an existing residence, in a situation where the unit will be used as an accessory dwelling by a member of the property owner's family. The medical disability must be certified by two physician statements and the member must be an immediate member of the property owner's family. Also, it must be shown by the applicant that the permit is necessary and the dwelling must be located nearby because the family member requires continuous observation. Once the medical hardship has terminated the temporary accessory dwelling shall be removed. The temporary medical hardship permit must be renewed with the director of planning and zoning by January 1 each year. Setup of the manufactured home shall meet the requirements set forth in section 34-558. 
                  (c)  An application for a temporary medical hardship permit authorizing temporary occupancy for the above-mentioned uses shall be submitted to the director of planning and zoning for approval. The temporary medical hardship permit shall be issued by the county for an appropriate period of time not to exceed 12-month increments. The owner of such temporary nonconforming use must agree to remove the temporary use upon expiration of the permit. The applicant can seek permit renewal in one-year increments if necessity continues beyond the initial year. The manufactured home must be removed within six months of the termination of the medical hardship. 
                  (d)  An applicant may seek approval for temporary use of a travel trailer or recreational vehicle while constructing a home. The temporary use permit shall not exceed 12 months. The applicant can seek an extension if necessity continues beyond the 12 months. 
                  (e)  An applicant may seek approval from the director of planning and zoning for temporary use of a travel trailer or recreational vehicle for the purpose of temporary housing while the occupants will be employed during a nonresidential construction project. This temporary use shall not be required to fully comply with section 34-625 of the Code of Lincoln County. Property owners will make application to Lincoln County Planning Commission for a "temporary use permit." The planning commission may authorize the director of planning and zoning to issue a temporary use permit for the construction camp site. Each applicant must meet the following conditions: 
                  (1)  Property must be zoned as Agricultural District (A-1, A-2, A-3). 
                  (2)  No more than five campers will be allowed per acre. 
                  (3)  A minimum setback of 250 feet is required off of any designated entrance corridors. 
                  (4)  Each camper shall be provided with an approved individual self contained camper service panel of not less than 30 amps with at least one GFCI 15 or 20 amp duplex receptacle.

                  (6)  All sites must have a sewage disposal system approved by the Lincoln County Health Department. (Unless public system is available) 
                  (7)  Must conform to the buffer requirements in subsection 64-631(3) of this Code. (Unless there is an existing wooded area to provide a comparable buffer) 
                  (8)  The temporary use permit shall not exceed 12 months. Property owner must seek an extension from the director of planning and zoning if necessity continues beyond the 12 months. 
                  (9)  A "guarantee of condition" bond will be required for all properties where travel trailers or recreational vehicles are being used for the purpose of temporary housing while the occupants will be employed during a nonresidential construction project. 
                  a.  The amount of the bond will be $500.00 for lots meeting all other requirements of this Code and containing up to ten campers; 
                  b.  The amount of the bond will be $1,000.00 for lots meeting all other requirements of this Code and containing more than ten campers; 
                  c.  Bond shall be by cash, certified check, bank check or money order; 
                  d.  The "guarantee of condition bond" will be refunded in full upon completion of construction project, removal of all campers, and subject to an inspection and approval by the Lincoln County Building Official and the property owner. 
                  (10)  During the temporary use permit the planning and zoning director or his designee may inspect the property at any time for compliance. Any violations found and not corrected in a timely manner may result in the temporary use permit being revoked.

                  (a)  List of districts. For the purpose of this chapter, the unincorporated area of the county is divided into the following classes of districts or zones: 
                  (1)  Agricultural districts: 
                  a.  A-1 Agricultural 
                  b.  A-2 Interior agricultural 
                  c.  A-3 Lakefront agricultural 
                  (2)  Residential zoning districts: 
                  a.  R-1 Low-density residential 
                  b.  R-2 Medium-density residential 
                  c.  R-3 High-density residential 
                  (3)  Commercial zoning districts: 
                  a.  C-1 Neighborhood commercial 
                  b.  C-2 General commercial 
                  c.  C-3 Heavy commercial 
                  (4)  Industrial zoning districts: 
                  a.  M-1 Light industrial 
                  b.  M-2 General industrial 
                  (5)  Other zoning districts: 
                  a.  P-1 Professional 
                  b.  PUD Planned unit development 
                  c.  PDD Planned development 
                  d.  ELCO Entrance/lake corridor overlay district 
                  (b)  Description of districts. 
                  (1)  Agricultural district (A-1). This district is established to provide for rural farm or nonfarm residences in areas where intensive land development is unlikely to or should not occur, yet permits a variety of housing options. 
                  (2)  Interior agricultural district (A-2). This district is established to provide for rural farm or nonfarm residences and agricultural pursuits in areas where intensive land development is unlikely to occur within the next five to ten years. 
                  (3)  Lakefront agricultural district (A-3). This district is established to provide for rural farm or nonfarm residences and agricultural pursuits in areas that will eventually develop as prime lakefront residential development. 
                  (4)  Low-density residential district (R-1). This district is established to provide for low to medium density single-family residential uses. 
                  (5)  Medium-density residential district (R-2). This district is established to provide for medium to high density single-family residential and two-family residential uses. 
                  (6)  High-density residential (R-3). This district is established to provide for high density single-family residential uses, two-family residential uses, multifamily residential uses, manufactured homes meeting the requirements of this chapter and manufactured home parks. 
                  (7)  Neighborhood commercial district (C-1). This district is established to provide decentralized areas for the retail sales of goods and for personal services which provide the everyday necessities and conveniences of local residents. This district is intended to permit only those nonresidential commercial uses of land and structures which blend smoothly into the character of adjoining residential areas. It is further intended to exclude all activities which generate perceptible light or noise or attract traffic from outside the immediate neighborhood. 
                  (8)  General commercial district (C-2). This district is established to provide for both highway commercial and planned commercial shopping or service centers. This district is intended to be utilized by those commercial uses which cater to community and regional shoppers as well as the traveling public. These commercial uses occupy relatively large sites and require access to major thoroughfares. It is intended that this district be located at major road intersections as provided by the county's development plan. 
                  (9)  Heavy commercial district (C-3). This district is established to provide areas for distribution, sales, service or storage activities involving goods or equipment requiring extensive indoor or outdoor spaces, large or specialized handling equipment or significant truck or rail transportation. These uses generate limited emissions and noise which make them incompatible with other commercial or residential uses. 
                  (10)  Light industrial district (M-1). This district is established to provide areas for industry in locations which lie near residential areas or which are served by major transportation facilities and adequate utilities but are not feasible nor highly desirable for conventional industrial development because of proximity to residential, recreational, retail or related developments. The regulations of this district are intended to encourage development compatible with uses of residential property adjoining or surrounding the district, with suitable open spaces, landscaping and parking areas. 
                  (11)  General industrial district (M-2). This district is established to provide areas for manufacturing, assembling, fabricating, warehousing and related activities. These uses generate some emissions and have some adverse effects on surrounding properties and are not compatible with primary commercial, institutional and residential uses. 
                  (12)  Professional district (P-1). This district is established to provide for the development of structures for professional services which do not generate large volumes of traffic, noise or other harmful effects on adjoining residential areas. It is intended that this district serve as a transition between more intensely developed commercial districts and residential districts. 
                  (13)  Planned unit development district (PUD). The intent of this section is to permit greater flexibility and consequently more creative and imaginative design for the development of residential, commercial and industrial areas than is generally possible under conventional zoning regulations. It is further intended to promote more economical and efficient use of the land while providing a harmonious variety of housing choices, a high level of amenities and preservations of natural qualities of open spaces. Within the planned unit development a variety of housing types and land uses may be permitted in an orderly relationship to one another and to existing land uses, as well as with due regard to comprehensive planning within the county. It is intended that this district be permitted only in areas where public water, sewer and other urban services are available. 
                  (14)  Planned development district (PDD). The intent of this use is to serve as a transition between more intensely developed commercial districts and single-family residential areas along major growth corridors. Special consideration shall be given to traffic safety, off-street parking and how the proposed development relates to and is buffered from existing homes. Major growth corridors are areas designated by resolution of the board of commissioners of the county, where intense growth is projected and where major road improvements are planned, in progress, or have been completed. 
                  (15)  Entrance/lake corridor overlay district (ELCO). The intent of this district is to protect and preserve the aesthetic character of major entrances into the county and along entrances to lakeshore areas and to reduce conflict between new construction and existing development and viewsheds. The corridors measure 250 feet to both sides from the centerline of a designated highway or street.

                  (a)  The boundaries of the various districts shall be shown on the official zoning map of the county. The official zoning map is hereby made a part of this chapter, and all notations, references and other information shown thereon shall be a part of this chapter as if set forth in this chapter. 
                  (b)  The official zoning map, as adopted by the board of commissioners and subsequently amended from time to time by its action, shall be maintained as so revised by the planning commission. The planning commission shall interpret the zoning map ( "official map") and answer questions concerning district boundary lines and lot lines.

                  (a)  District boundaries. Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any districts as shown on the zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 
                  (1)  Unless otherwise indicated, the district boundaries are lot lines, the centerlines of streets, railroad rights-of-way, streams, or such lines extended. Where district boundaries cut a block transversely or longitudinally, the line shall not cut through a lot, but shall coincide with the appropriate lot lines. 
                  (2)  Where the district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the corporate limit, such corporate limit line shall be construed to be such boundary. 
                  (3)  Zoning district boundary lines not coinciding with lot lines, the centerlines of streets or alleys or such lines extended, railroad right-of-way lines, the centerlines of creeks or streams or the corporate lines of any incorporated places in the county as it existed at the time of the enactment of this chapter shall be determined by use of the scale of the official zoning map of county unless actual dimensions are noted. 
                  (b)  Zoning district boundary changes. 
                  (1)  If in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, changes are made in the district boundaries or other information portrayed on the official zoning map, changes shall be made on the official zoning map by the planning commission within 30 days after the amendment has been approved by the county board of commissioners. 
                  (2)  Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the official zoning map which may from time to time be made or published, the official zoning map which shall be located in the office of the county planning and permits department shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of land in the county.

                  Sec. 34-628. - Animals in residential districts. 
                  (a)  Purpose. It is the intent of this section to permit certain uses in residential zoning districts which involve the keeping of limited numbers of domestic animals or pets where it is recognized that such areas are changing from agricultural to suburban residential in character. This section is further intended to minimize problems which may arise from such animal uses and to provide suitable standards for protection of health, safety, welfare and preservation of residential zoning districts from indiscriminate raising of animals. These restrictions apply to districts R-1, R-2 and R-3 and shall be subject to all state and local health codes. 
                  (b)  Uses permitted. 
                  (1)  Livestock. Horses, cows, pigs, ponies, donkeys and other domestic livestock may be kept, raised or bred for home use and enjoyment provided that only one such animal shall be permitted for each 15,000 square feet of land area and shall be adequately contained within the property. 
                  (2)  Domestic pets. Cats, dogs, rabbits or other generally recognized domestic pets may be kept or bred by persons residing on the property for their use and enjoyment. 
                  (3)  Fowl. Ducks, quail, chickens, turkeys, squabs, pheasants, etc. may be raised for home use provided such fowl are adequately contained within that property. 
                  (4)  Number of animals within a residence. These permitted use provisions for animals in residential areas are meant to apply outside of the residence on an individual lot and are not intended to restrict the type or number of animals within a residence. 
                  (5)  Distance from property lines. Notwithstanding any provision in this section to the contrary, buildings or other structures which are located in residential districts and are used to accommodate or restrain animals noted in subsections (b)(1) and (3) of this section shall be located no less than 50 feet from all property lines. 
                  (c)  Uses prohibited. The keeping, breeding or training of any animals or fowl for monetary gain or profit shall be deemed a commercial business and be permitted in the A district and expressly prohibited in all other residential districts except where such operations may qualify as a home occupation.

                  Sec. 34-630. - Height of fences and walls in a residential zoning district. 
                  No fence or wall, other than a retaining wall, in a required setback area for a residential zoning district shall be more than six feet in height above finished grade, except as required for screening as specified in section 34-633. 
                  (Ord. No. 48, § 20-10, 1-9-2003) 
                  Sec. 34-631. - Buffer requirements. 
                  A buffer shall be required whenever two adjoining properties are in different zoning districts. Buffers shall be located on the outer perimeter of a parcel along all lot lines adjoining different zoning districts including adjacent property lines, which may be separated by an existing or proposed public right-of-way. Buffers shall not be located on any portion of existing, dedicated or reserved public or private street rights-of-way. 
                  (1)  Required buffers in commercial and industrial zoning districts. In any commercial or industrial zoning district, where a commercial or industrial lot abuts any adjacent nonconforming residential use within that district, the required buffer for the commercial or industrial property when acquiring a building permit, unless the buffer was preexisting, shall consist of a 50-foot setback from the adjoining property line containing not less than a 20-foot base width consisting of plantings plus a wall (not otherwise part of a structure or accessory building), fence or a berm, or any combination thereof, which meets the screening standards in section 34-633. 
                  (2)  Required buffers between residential, commercial and industrial zoning districts. When two adjoining properties are in different residential, commercial or industrial zoning districts, the property within the zoning district allowing for more intensive uses is required to provide the buffer when acquiring a building permit unless the buffer was preexisting. When two adjoining vacant parcels are in different zoning districts, no buffer is required when the parcel zoned for the less intensive use requires a building permit. 
                  The required buffer shall consist of a 50-foot setback from the adjoining property line containing not less than a 20-foot base width consisting of plantings plus a wall (not otherwise part of a structure or accessory building), fence or a berm, or any combination thereof, which meets the screening standards in section 34-633. 
                  (3)  Required buffers between manufactured home parks, multifamily residential and single-family residential uses. When two adjoining properties are different in intensity of use (single-family residential is a less intensive use than either a multifamily residential or a manufactured home park), whether in the same or in different zoning districts, the property of the more intensive use is required to provide a buffer when acquiring a building permit unless the buffer was preexisting. 
                  The required buffer shall consist of plantings or a fence, wall (not otherwise part of a structure or accessory building), or a berm, which meets the screening standards of section 34-633. If plantings are used as the method of screening, the planting area shall have a minimum base width of 12 feet. 
                  (4)  Maintenance. The responsibility for maintenance of buffers shall remain with the owner of the property. Any required plant that has expired shall be replaced. 
                  (5)  Failure to comply with the buffer requirements. See sections 34-421—34-430 for enforcement and penalty provisions.

                  Sec. 34-632. - Screening of service areas. 
                  Any service area, loading area, refuse or storage area between a principal building and a public street being visible from the street and lying within 100 feet of the street shall be provided with screening consisting of not less than a 25-foot base width consisting of plantings plus a wall (not otherwise part of a structure or accessory building), fence or a berm, or any combination thereof, which meet the screening standards of section 34-633. 
                  (Ord. No. 48, § 20-12, 1-9-2003) 
                  Sec. 34-633. - Screening standards. 
                  Screening is a method of visually shielding one use from another by walls, fences, berms or densely planted vegetation. The director shall make a determination as to whether the required screening has occurred. 
                  (1)  Plantings. Plantings shall consist of either trees or shrubs or any combination of both. Planted areas shall be located along the abutting property lines or in areas that provide the best screening effectiveness. 
                  If trees or large shrubs are used solely as the screening device, under normal growing conditions, they should attain a minimum growing height of eight feet and a canopy spread of ten feet within four years. They shall be planted a minimum of 20 feet on center. 
                  When trees or large shrubs, are used in conjunction with a wall, fence or a berm, or combination thereof, to form the required screening, the minimum sufficient opaqueness shall be held to require no less than three feet of trees and/or shrubs in the area immediately adjacent to the wall, fence or a berm. This is to be measured along the ground surface from the fence to the inside border of such plantings. They should attain a minimum growing height of eight feet and a canopy spread of ten feet within four years. 
                  (2)  Walls. Walls shall be of masonry construction and a minimum six feet in height, but no greater than eight feet in height. The wall shall be placed on the edge of the buffer nearest the most intense use of land. 
                  (3)  Fences. Fences shall be a minimum of six feet in height, but no more than eight feet in height. They shall be constructed of standard wood fencing material and methods of chain link with woven inserts that will provide 90 percent visual blockage. The fence shall be placed on the edge of the buffer nearest the most intense land use. 
                  (4)  Berms. Earthen berms shall have a minimum height of six feet.

                  Sec. 34-634. - Entrance/lake corridor overlay district. 
                  The intent of this district is to protect and preserve the aesthetic character of major entrances into the county and along entrances to lakeshore areas and to reduce conflict between new construction and existing development and viewsheds. The corridors measure 250 feet to both sides from the centerline of a designated highway or street. 
                  (1)  Prohibited uses within an entrance or lake corridor. 
                  a.  Class A, B, or C manufactured housing. 
                  b.  Manufactured home parks. 
                  c.  Accessory buildings with no primary building constructed on the lot. 
                  (2)  Additional standards for accessory buildings. Accessory buildings with an entrance/lake corridor shall be architecturally similar to the main structure. Prefabricated carports, sheds or similar structures shall be permitted in all entrance or lake corridors where the underlying zoning district is agricultural (A-1, A-2, A-3) and shall conform to all other provisions of this code.

                  1.  The applicant shall contact the owners of all existing or planned towers of a height roughly equal to or greater than the height of the tower proposed by the applicant. A list shall be provided of all owners contacted, the date of such contact, and the form and content of such contact. 
                  2.  Such contact shall be made in a timely manner; that is, sufficiently before the filing of an application to include a response into the application when filed. 
                  i.  Failure of a listed owner to respond shall not be relevant if a timely, good faith effort was made to obtain one. However, where an existing or planned tower is known to have capacity for additional antennas of the sort proposed, based on the decision regarding such tower, that application for a new tower shall not be complete until the owner of the existing or planned tower responds. Such response is to be required as a condition of approval. 
                  ii.  Once an owner demonstrates an antenna of the sort proposed by the applicant cannot be accommodated on the owner's tower as described below, the owner need not be contacted by future applicants for antennas of the sort proposed. 
                  s.  The applicant shall request the following information from each tower contacted: 
                  1.  Identification of the site by location, tax lot number, existing uses, and tower height. 
                  2.  Whether each such tower could structurally accommodate the antenna proposed by the applicant without requiring structural changes be made to the tower. To enable the owner to respond, the applicant shall provide each such owner with the height, length, weight, and other relevant data about the proposed antenna. 
                  3.  Whether each such tower could structurally accommodate the proposed antenna if structural changes were made, not including totally rebuilding the tower. If so, the owner shall specify in general terms what structural changes would be required. 
                  4.  If structurally able, would collocation by such existing tower be precluded for reasons related to RF interference. If so, the owner shall describe in general terms what changes in either the existing or proposed antenna would be required to accommodate the proposed tower, if at all. 
                  5.  If collocation is possible, the fee an owner of an existing tower would charge for such shared use. 
                  t.  Collocation is not precluded simply because a reasonable fee for shared use is charged, or because of reasonable costs necessary to adapt the existing and proposed uses to a shared tower. The director, commission and the governing body may consider expert testimony to determine whether the fee and costs are reasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed unreasonable. 
                  u.  Additional information. The director may request additional information in order to fully evaluate and review the application and the potential impact of a proposed tower and/or antenna. 
                  v.  Application fee.

                  (1)  No amendment shall become effective unless it shall have been initiated by either the board of commissioners or the planning commission, the property owner, or an individual who has the owner's power of attorney authorizing him to act, or a request signed by 60 percent of the property owners who hold not less than 60 percent of the affected land. 
                  (2)  As used in this article, the term "amendment" means both a change to the "official zoning map" and a change to the text of this chapter unless otherwise indicated. All proposed amendments shall first be submitted to the planning commission who shall conduct a public hearing and shall make a written recommendation to the board of commissioners. The power to approve and enact an amendment rests solely within the legislative discretion of the board of commissioners. 
                  (Ord. No. 48, § 23-1, 1-9-2003) 
                  Sec. 34-732. - Procedure. 
                  (a)  Application for amendment. All proposed amendments shall be initiated by an application with the director on forms provided by the county. A standard fee shall be paid with the application for amendment of these regulations may be in the form of a proposal for amendment of the text of regulations or a proposal for amendment of the zoning map. 
                  (b)  Notification of public hearing; property in violation prohibited. Within 15 days after receiving the application, the director shall in writing inform the applicant of the date on which a public hearing will be held to consider the zoning change. 
                  No application will be accepted from any person regarding any property that is in violation of this chapter. If the property, at the time of application, which is the subject of an amendment or any other action of the board of commissioners, is found to be in violation of this chapter, then the board of commissioners will not accept and/or process any application from that applicant until the applicant voluntarily removes or changes the cause of the violation or ceases to be in violation. The applicant must then notify the director that he is no longer in violation and obtain a release from the director as to the violation. Once released, the board of commissioners will then accept the application for amendment of this chapter. 
                  (c)  Erection of sign. Upon receiving an application for a map amendment and establishing the date of the public hearing concerning the petitioned request, the director shall erect in a conspicuous place on the property in question or on the right-of-way of the nearest public road if the property does not front a public road a sign giving notice of both the existing zoning district in which the property is located and the requested change and the scheduled date and place for the public hearing. 
                  (d)  Referral to planning commission. After acceptance of application for amendment, the director shall transmit a copy thereof to the planning commission for its review during the scheduled public hearing and recommendation. It will study the proposed amendment and determine if it meets the standards as enumerated in section 34-733. Once the public hearing has been conducted in accordance with section 34-736, the planning commission shall make a written recommendation to the board of commissioners stating its approval or disapproval of the requested zoning change. Such recommendation shall be made by the planning commission within 45 days of the public hearing or the requested zoning change shall be deemed to have been recommended for approval by the planning commission. 
                  (Ord. No. 48, § 23-2, 1-9-2003) 
                  Sec. 34-733. - Zoning standards. 
                  (a)  The exercise of the zoning power of the county shall constitute an effort to balance the interest of the community in promoting the public health, safety, morality and general welfare against the right of property owners to the unrestricted use of their property. The following factors shall be considered by the planning commission when reviewing and making its written recommendation and by the board of commissioners when making a decision whether to approve or deny the requested amendment. These factors are determined to be relevant in balancing the interest in promoting the public health, safety, morality and general welfare against the right to the unrestricted use of the property: 
                  (1)  Whether the proposed amendment would allow a use that is generally suitable for the site compared to other possible uses and the uses and zoning of adjacent and nearby properties; 
                  (2)  Whether the proposed amendment would adversely affect the economic value or the uses of adjacent and nearby properties; 
                  (3)  Whether the property to be affected by the proposed amendment can be used as currently zoned; 
                  (4)  Whether the proposed amendment, if adopted, would result in a use which would or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, schools, sewers, water resources, police and fire protection or other utilities; 
                  (5)  Whether there are other conditions or transitional patterns affecting the use and development of the property sought to be rezoned, if applicable, which give ground for either approval or disapproval of the proposed amendment. 
                  (b)  The county shall consider any proposed amendment properly initiated in light of the factors set forth in this section. In evaluating the factors set forth in this section, it shall be the policy of the county to exercise its zoning power in conformity with the policy and intent of the county comprehensive plan insofar as that plan is current in its application to the specific property that is the subject of the proposed amendment. It is further the policy of the county to exercise the zoning power for purposes of assuring the compatibility of use of adjacent and nearby properties and the preservation of the economic value of adjacent and nearby properties while enabling a reasonable use of all property. 
                  (Ord. No. 48, § 23-3, 1-9-2003) 
                  Sec. 34-734. - Public hearing. 
                  Before making a written recommendation to the board of commissioners, the planning commission shall hold a public hearing thereon. A public hearing shall be conducted at the time and place specified by the planning commission and as set forth in the public notice described in section 34-735. The purpose of such hearing shall be to present to the public the proposed zoning amendment, and to receive comments thereon from the public. The board of commissioners shall consider the proceedings and comments of such hearing on the proposed zoning amendment in making a final decision on whether to approve or deny the amendment application. The planning commission shall prescribe the rules of order for its deliberations on matters with which it is charged under this chapter, and the rules of order shall be consistent with the general requirements and purposes set forth in this article and other general laws of the state concerning conduct of proceedings of public commissions, bodies and governmental units. 
                  (Ord. No. 48, § 23-4, 1-9-2003) 
                  Sec. 34-735. - Public notice. 
                  (a)  Public notice of the hearing on a proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance of the county shall be given as set forth in subsection (b). 
                  (b)  At least 15, but not more than 45 days prior to the date set by the planning commission for the hearing, a written notice shall be published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county setting forth the time, place, and purpose of the hearing. Such notice shall contain a summary of the proposed amendment, if a text amendment, and in the case of a map amendment, the location of the property, its area, name or owner, and the proposed change or classification. 
                  (Ord. No. 48, § 23-5, 1-9-2003) 
                  Sec. 34-736. - Conduct of hearings. 
                  The following policies and procedures shall govern the conduct of public hearings under this chapter: 
                  (1)  The hearing shall be convened by the chair of the planning commission at the time and place scheduled. 
                  (2)  The chair shall open any hearing with an explanation of the purpose of the hearing and a description of the general rules for the conduct of the hearing. The chair or his designee may describe the authority and role of the planning commission in any zoning decision. 
                  (3)  The chair shall review the procedures for holding the public hearing which shall be as follows: 
                  a.  No person may speak until recognized by the chair. Upon rising to speak, the person recognized must first state his name and address. 
                  b.  One or two spokespersons will be allowed two minutes to express opinions of the proposed zoning revisions; provided, however, that the spokespersons shall speak no longer than an aggregate of ten minutes. 
                  c.  Any remark amounting to an attack on the character or personal integrity of another individual, or comment not factually supportable, or comment in the form of an emotional outburst, shall be irrelevant to the purpose of any hearing and may be ruled out of order. 
                  d.  Additional persons will be recognized in accordance with the procedure set forth in this section for the purpose of addressing additional issues and making additional points, but no speaker shall be allowed to address points which have already been thoroughly discussed. 
                  e.  In the case of each petition for amendment to the zoning ordinance, the chair shall allow the applicant, or the agent for the applicant, to speak first and to present the arguments of the applicant in favor of the proposed amendment. 
                  (Ord. No. 48, § 23-6, 1-9-2003) 
                  Sec. 34-737. - Official action by the board of commissioners. 
                  (a)  Once the planning commission submits a recommendation to the board of commissioners, the board of commissioners at a regular meeting may take action approving or rejecting the proposal at that meeting, or the board of commissioners may table the question for consideration at its next regular meeting or a called meeting to be held no later than the next regular meeting. 
                  (b)  The planning commission's role in any zoning amendment decision shall be advisory only. Any zoning amendment decision shall be made by the board of commissioners who shall either approve or disapprove the proposed zoning amendment. 
                  (Ord. No. 48, § 23-7, 1-9-2003) 
                  Sec. 34-738. - Speculative rezonings/reversion. 
                  The county discourages the use of rezonings as a strategy to increase speculative land value where the applicant has no immediate intent to develop in accordance with the rezoning. Rezonings are intended to grant the applicant an opportunity to exercise appropriate alternative development options in situations where development in compliance with existing zoning is not possible or practicable, as long as the proposed uses are consistent with the comprehensive plan and the character of the surrounding area. The granting of this privilege by the county carries with it the expectation that the proposed development will occur within a reasonable period of time. Therefore, when the board of commissioners grants approval of a rezoning, the applicant should acquire a construction permit or final plat approval (whichever is applicable) and commence construction activities in compliance with that permit or approval within one year of the date upon which the rezoning is approved. Reversion: If such actions have not been taken within one year, the planning commission may initiate actions to further rezone the subject property and/or to reinstate the original zoning classification. 
                  (Ord. No. 48, § 23-8, 1-9-2003) 
                  Sec. 34-739. - Appeal from decision of the board of commissioners. 
                  Appeals from the decision of the board of commissioners regarding the approval or disapproval of a zoning amendment shall be made in accordance with the judicial review in section 34-430. 
                  (Ord. No. 48, § 23-9, 1-9-2003) 
                  Sec. 34-740. - Limitation on reapplication. 
                  No application for amendment of the zoning ordinance once heard by the planning commission shall be accepted for a rehearing until at least six months shall have passed since written recommendation was made by the planning commission to the board of commissioners. 
                  (Ord. No. 48, § 23-10, 1-9-2003) 
                  Sec. 34-741. - Withdrawal without prejudice. 
                  An application may not be withdrawn or amended by the applicant after the public hearing has been advertised. However, the planning commission may by a majority vote allow an application to be withdrawn without prejudice.

                  This article shall be known as the "Groundwater Recharge Area Protection Ordinance of Lincoln County, Georgia."

                  Sec. 46-32. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Aquifer means any stratum (rock layer) or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well. 
                  Groundwater recharge area (synonymous with aquifer recharge area) means an area of the earth's surface where water infiltrated the ground, thereby replenishing the groundwater supplies within an aquifer. 
                  Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of groundwater to pollution from chemical spills, leaching of pollutants from dump sites, animal waste from agricultural operations or pollution generated by other human activities. 
                  Pollution susceptibility maps means maps prepared by the state department of natural resources that show the relative susceptibility of groundwater to pollution. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas of high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential. 
                  Significant groundwater recharge areas means areas mapped by the department of natural resources in Hydrologic Atlas, 18 1989 edition. Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology (chemical nature and form of the rock), soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts, geologic structure, presence of "karst" topography (sinkholes, caves and fissures associated with limestone and other carbonate rocks), and potentiometric surfaces.

                  Sec. 46-33. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the county and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that are contained within aquifers, which are permeable, rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. 
                  (b)  Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized.

                  The objectives of this article are to protect groundwater quality by: 
                  (1)  Restricting land uses that generate, use or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas; 
                  (2)  Limiting density of development; and 
                  (3)  Ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality.

                  Sec. 70-232. - Sewers. 
                  (a)  Size of sewers. Sewers connecting component parts of on-site sewage management systems shall be of sufficient size to serve anticipated flow conditions. 
                  (b)  Materials. All pipe or tile and fittings used in sewers and absorption fields shall meet nationally recognized standards for their designated use, such as standards published by the American Society for Testing and Materials or NSF International (formerly known as the National Sanitation Foundation), and approved by the county board of health for use in on-site sewage management systems. Sewers under driveways or similar areas of load or impact shall be of material capable of withstanding anticipated loads or installed so as to provide protection from crushing. 
                  (c)  Construction. Sewers, other than perforated pipe or drain tile used in absorption fields, shall be laid with sealed, watertight, root-resistant joints. Such sewers shall be laid on a firm foundation, and shall not by subject to settling, and shall be installed on a grade that will insure a self-cleaning velocity. Where on-site sewage management systems are used, and where installation of building drains and building sewers is not covered by duly adopted local plumbing codes, or in the absence of a local plumbing code and/or plumbing inspections, the county board of health shall verify the adequacy and acceptability of all of any portion of the building sewer or the building drain. 
                  (Ord. No. 4, § 4, 10-2-1984) 
                  Sec. 70-233. - Septic tanks. 
                  (a)  Minimum design and construction. Septic tanks shall be designed and constructed to equal or exceed minimum design and construction criteria established by the department as published in the current manual for on-site sewage management systems. Any person seeking approval of septic tanks to be used in on-site sewage management systems after the effective date of Ordinance No. 4, shall submit detailed plans and specifications for tank manufacture and such other information as may be required by the county board of health. Manufacturers and suppliers shall be subject to periodic inspection and shall be approved by the county board of health. 
                  (b)  Location. No septic tank shall be installed less than 50 feet from existing or proposed wells/springs, or suction water lines, and tanks shall be located downgrade from wells/or springs if physically possible; less than 25 feet from lakes, ponds, streams, watercourses, or sink holes; less than ten feet from a property line. No septic tank shall be installed less than fifteen feet from a drainage ditch or embankment. Septic tanks shall be installed so as to provide ready access for necessary maintenance. Normally the desired distance a septic tank shall be located from a building foundation is at least ten feet but if conditions permit, lesser distances may be allowed by the county board of health. The county board of health, after site inspection, may require greater separation distances than cited in this division due to unusual conditions of topography, or other site configurations, subsurface soil characteristics and/or groundwater interference. 
                  (c)  Capacity. The liquid capacity of septic tanks for single-family dwellings shall not be less than 750 gallons for one or two bedrooms; 900 gallons for three bedrooms; 1,000 gallons for four bedrooms and 250 additional gallons for each bedroom over four. The liquid capacity of septic tanks in on-site sewage management systems for nonresidential usage shall be based on the anticipated daily sewage flow from the facility served, but in no case shall be increased by 50 percent where garbage grinders are to be used. 
                  (d)  Compartmented tanks. Compartmented tanks are permissible upon approval by the county board of health. 
                  (e)  Tanks in series. The county board of health may approve the installation of two septic tanks placed in series provided that the capacity of the first tank is at least 750 gallons and at least equal to the capacity of the second tank. When tanks in series are used, they shall be connected with a sealed sewer line, and all sewage shall initially enter the first tank. 
                  (f)  Foundation and backfill. Septic tanks shall be constructed or installed level, on a foundation that will prevent settling; backfill shall be placed so that a stable fill results and undue strain on the tank is avoided. Earth backfill shall be free of voids, large stones, stumps, broken masonry, or other such materials. A minimum earth cover of six inches over the tank is recommended. All openings and manholes shall be constructed so as to prevent the entrance of surface water.

                  Sec. 70-234. - Distribution boxes and dosing tanks. 
                  (a)  Minimum design and construction of distribution boxes. Distribution boxes shall be designed and constructed in accordance with minimum design and construction criteria established in the department's current manual and section 70-235(d)(1). Approval procedures shall follow the requirements as set forth under section 70-233(a). 
                  (b)  Minimum design and construction of dosing tanks. Where required, dosing tanks shall be designed, constructed, and installed in accordance with the department's current manual. 
                  (Ord. No. 4, § 6, 10-2-1984) 
                  Sec. 70-235. - Absorption fields. 
                  (a)  Area computation Absorption trench bottom area shall be based upon the anticipated volume of treated sewage and upon the characteristics of the soil in which absorption fields are to be located as specified in the current on-site sewage management system manual. Soil characteristics and other related data, including percolation tests, may be required by the county board of health. 
                  (b)  Location. No absorption field shall be constructed less than 100 feet from existing or proposed wells or springs; less than ten feet from water supply lines; less than ten feet from building foundations and property lines; less than 15 feet from an embankment nor less than 50 feet from the normal water level of any impoundment, tributary, stream or other body of water. If it becomes necessary for the absorption field to be crossed by a water supply line, the water supply line within ten feet of the absorption field shall be at least 12 inches above the top of the aggregate layer of the absorption line and shall be encased in a single length of water pipe. No absorption field shall be installed in areas where groundwater, soil characteristics or adverse geological formation may interfere with the absorption of sewage effluent. 
                  (c)  Minimum design and construction for conventional septic tank systems. Absorption lines and absorption trench bottoms shall be true to grade, and trenches shall be not less than 25 inches in depth, and shall have not less than 12 inches of earth cover. Maximum length of absorption trench laterals for distribution box systems shall be 100 feet; laterals shall be equal in length and spaced no less than eight feet apart, center to center. Absorption trenches shall not be more than 36 inches wide. 
                  (d)  Field layout methods for conventional septic tank systems. Absorption fields shall be planned and installed in accordance with one of the following methods: 
                  (1)  Distribution box method. On level or sloping topography, the distribution box method may be used and shall be required when dosing tanks are used. A firm earthen or concrete foundation for distribution boxes extending at least 12 inches beyond the walls of the box shall be provided to insure against the tilting of the distribution box. Extreme care shall be exercised in backfilling around and over the distribution box. The top of the distribution box shall have a minimum earth cover of six inches but no more than 24 inches unless provisions are made for ready access to the distribution box and terminate inside the distribution box with an elbow turned downward to form a submerged outlet at normal water level, or a baffle may be used, providing the same function is accomplished. Absorption lines of equal lengths shall be connected to distribution box outlets by independent sewers. Absorption trenches may be installed at the same elevation or at different elevations, but at all sewers leading from the distribution box outlet to the absorption lines shall be installed at the same elevation and shall be level for two feet and shall be sealed watertight. Beginning two feet from the distribution box, the grade of such sealed lines shall not be less than one-eighth inch per foot. Absorption lines shall be laid in uniform grade of not less than two inches nor more than four inches per 100 feet with the minimum of two inches recommended. An increased number of shorter trenches is recommended rather than the use of fewer, longer trenches. 
                  (2)  Level field method. On level or slightly sloping topography, the level field method may be used. When this method is used, the absorption field shall be installed level, with all absorption lines interconnected to form a continuous system. A standard tee fitting shall be used to interconnect the absorption lines. 
                  (3)  Serial distribution method. On more severely sloping topography, the serial distribution method may be used. When this method is used, level absorption trenches shall be constructed along land contours. The sewer from the septic tank shall enter the uppermost absorption lines and terminate at any point in the line so that all sewage from the septic tank is discharged into the first line. Adjacent absorption lines shall be successively connected by means of overflow sewers constructed at any point along the line in such a manner that each trench is filled with effluent to the full depth to aggregate before the effluent flows through the overflow sewer to the next trench. The invert of the first overflow sewer must be at least four inches lower than the invert of the septic tank outlet. At the point where an overflow sewer leaves an absorption trench, the excavation for the overflow sewer shall be dug no deeper than the top of the aggregate in the absorption trench, so that an undisturbed block of earth will remain in place for the full depth of the aggregate. Overflow sewers connecting absorption trenches shall be laid on undisturbed earth. 
                  (Ord. No. 4, § 7, 10-2-1984) 
                  Sec. 70-236. - Privies. 
                  Privies shall be designed and constructed in accordance with minimum design and construction criteria established by the current on-site sewage management system manual. 
                  (Ord. No. 4, § 8, 10-2-1984) 
                  Sec. 70-237. - Alternative and experimental on-site sewage management systems and site modifications. 
                  (a)  Generally. The department recognizes that on-site sewage management systems employing solids retention and on-site soil absorption of sewage effluent, if designed properly and installed in suitable soil, are usually ecologically safe and do adequately protect the public health. 
                  (b)  Information required for installation. The department further recognizes that substantial portions of the state's undeveloped land area are marginally suitable or totally unsuitable for conventional septic tank systems, and that continued installation of such systems will have a detrimental effect on the public health. Where appropriate, and after thorough assessment of alternatives, the county board of health will consider alternative on-site sewage management systems and/or modifications for areas with soils which may have only marginal suitability in their present condition including community managed on-site sewage management systems and combinations of public or community sewage treatment systems and on-site sewage management systems. When considering proposals for alternative on-site sewage management systems, priority shall be given to those situations where the alternative system will resolve an existing sewage management problem. Any person or community desiring to install an alternative on-site sewage management system shall submit the following information to the county board of health: 
                  (1)  Plans and specifications, along with any engineering, laboratory, or field data required. 
                  (2)  Information as required on the application for an individual on-site sewage management system construction permit, and any additional information as may be required by the county board of health. If the proposal for the system is approved, the person making application will be informed by the county board of health of any requirements for maintenance, and any monitoring procedures deemed necessary by the county board of health. Reduction of water usage by the installation of water conserving fixtures and devices should be considered in overall strategy. 
                  (c)  Experimental on-site sewage management systems. The department may consider proposals for the use of experimental on-site sewage management systems. Acceptance or denial of such proposals shall depend on many site and system specific factors, including a primary consideration that the remainder of the site is suitable for conventional septic tank system in the event of failure of the experimental system. 
                  (d)  Site modifications. Approval of certain lots determined to be unsuitable for conventional septic tank systems, may be reconsidered if appropriate site modifications are carried out to eliminate or significantly ameliorate unfavorable site characteristics. Modifications may include surface or subsurface drainage systems, filling, grading, etc. Any person desiring to modify a lot for the purpose of obtaining a construction permit for installation of an on-site sewage management system shall submit for approval, detailed plans showing the type and extent of modifications. The county board of health may require any additional information or clarification needed for formulating a proper decision on the proposed modifications. No modifications shall be carried out prior to the approval and issuance of a construction permit.

                  Sec. 70-238. - Percolation tests and test borings. 
                  (a)  Use of tests. If conducted, percolation tests shall not be considered presumptive or conclusive evidence as to the suitability of a given lot for the use of on-site sewage management systems. Such tests shall be considered and analyzed as one of many criteria in determining soil suitability. Acceptable data on soil characteristics, including the location of rock strata and water table evaluations, will be considered of primary importance. Percolation tests, if conducted will be used to augment or supplement the soils data. It should be further understood that percolation tests conducted during dry weather periods in areas that commonly experience high seasonal water table elevations during wet periods of the year will often exhibit very good percolation rates, thus inaccurately portraying the absorptive capacity of the soil during wet periods. Percolation tests shall be run in accordance with the modified Taft Engineering Center method published in the department's current manual for on-site sewage management systems. 
                  (b)  Location and number. Percolation test holes shall be located in the area proposed for the installation of the absorption field. Data from test holes in areas outside of, or clearly uncharacteristic of, the proposed installation site will not be allowed. Percolation tests shall not be conducted in holes created by the deterioration of stumps and roots, or any other area which would render results that inaccurately portray the absorptive capacity of the soil in absorption field area. The number of tests shall be sufficient to obtain a proper appraisal of the absorptive capacity of the soil in the proposed absorption field area and shall be determined by the county board of health. The number of tests required for preliminary appraisal of subdivisions may be specified in lesser numbers, provided a general overview of the soil characteristics of the total subdivision acreage is provided. Percolation test holes shall be located by number on a topographic map showing lot designations, boundaries, easements, etc., and the results shall be recorded on the map. 
                  (c)  Test borings for rock, shale and hardpan. Where surface outcropping or subsurface formations raise reasonable doubt concerning the operational effectiveness of on-site sewage management systems, a sufficient number of test borings to an appropriate depth may be required by the county board of health to determine whether on-site sewage management systems can be expected to give satisfactory service. Such borings and the results shall be located by number and recorded on the topographic map. 
                  (d)  Individuals conducting tests. Individuals conducting percolation tests and/or test borings shall notify the county board of health at least 24 hours prior to performing these procedures and, at the option of the county board of health, such procedures shall be performed in the presence of a county board of health representative. 
                  (Ord. No. 4, § 10, 10-2-1984) 
                  Sec. 70-239. - Septage removal and disposal. 
                  (a)  Septage removal permit. No person shall engage in the removal or disposal of the contents of septic tanks, pit privies, or other on-site sewage management or experimental systems without having first applied for and obtained from the county board of health a septage removal permit, renewed annually, for such activities. The application for such septage removal permit shall be submitted in writing on forms provided by the county board of health at least ten days prior to engaging in such activities. The application shall include but not be limited to: 
                  (1)  The business name and address; 
                  (2)  The name and address of the applicant; 
                  (3)  The manner by which such contents are to be removed, transported and given final disposal; and 
                  (4)  Such other documentation as may be required by the county board of health, including evidence that septage removed and transported will be accepted at approved disposal sites. 
                  If surface spreading, subsurface land disposal or other method of treatment or disposal is to be used, additional information may be required. 
                  (b)  Disposal methods. Approved methods of disposal of septage from on-site sewage management systems shall be discharged to a public or community sewage treatment system for treatment in a wastewater treatment plant, treatment at separate septage handling facilities, or direct land application. Disposal by any of these methods shall require written permission from the appropriate governing official, the private septage handling facility owner or landowner and a representative of the county board of health. 
                  (c)  Vehicle identification. The name and address of the person engaging in the removal of septage from on-site sewage management systems and the permit number shall be lettered on both sides of each vehicle used for septage removal purposes. Letters and numerals shall not be less than two inches in height and shall be readily visible. 
                  (d)  Vehicle maintenance. Every vehicle used for removal of septage from on-site sewage management systems shall be equipped with a watertight tank or body and properly maintained. Liquid wastes shall not be transported in open bodied vehicles. All pumps, hose lines, valves and fittings shall be maintained so as to prevent leakage. 
                  (Ord. No. 4, § 11, 10-2-1984) 
                  Sec. 70-240. - Grease traps. 
                  (a)  Required. Grease traps shall be required for commercial or industrial establishments with on-site sewage management systems where it is determined by the county board of health that grease may be introduced into the system in quantities that may adversely affect the operation of the system. 
                  (b)  Design. Plans and specifications for grease traps shall be submitted to the county board of health for approval. Grease traps shall be designed to provide a liquid capacity of not less than 125 gallons. Effluent from grease traps shall be disposed of in a septic tank and not directly discharged to the absorption field. 
                  (c)  Construction. Grease traps shall be located, installed and constructed so that the temperature of the sewage will be reduced to permit congealing or separation of grease and easy access for cleaning is provided.

                  Sec. 70-241. - Sewage flow. 
                  Where sizing of the on-site sewage management system is determined by sewage flow, estimates of the daily sewage flow shall not be less than the volume derived from the population to be served. Daily sewage flow shall be determined from the department's current manual; however, the flow for establishments not listed shall be determined by the county board of health after due consideration of data submitted by the owner or his agent on design criteria. Calculations will be made on the basis of peak flow loads and not on long term averages. 
                  (Ord. No. 4, § 13, 10-2-1984) 
                  Sec. 70-242. - Subdivision and mobile home parks. 
                  (a)  Plans required. No person may sell, offer for sale, lease, rent, begin construction or otherwise begin the physical development of a subdivision or mobile home park where public or community sewage treatment systems are not available or contemplated to be available to serve the proposed development until proposals and plans for the water supply and sewage disposal method to be provided or installed have been submitted to an written approval has been obtained from the county board of health. 
                  (b)  Predevelopment review advised. All developers considering subdivision or mobile home park development where public or community sewage treatment systems will not be available are strongly advised to seek a predevelopment review by the county board of health prior to purchasing property and/or making substantial monetary outlays for developmental improvements. Rejection or tentative approval may be obtained at this time by submitting the following information: 
                  (1)  A boundary plat including a: 
                  a.  Vicinity map; 
                  b.  Topographic map; 
                  c.  Soil map and soil descriptions. 
                  (2)  Complete subdivision analysis record on forms provided by the county board of health. 
                  (3)  Additional information as required by the county board of health for complete understanding and clarification. 
                  (c)  Proposals and plans. Unless previously provided, subdivision or mobile home park proposals shall be submitted on subdivision analysis forms provided by the county board of health. Subdivisions or mobile home park plans shall be drawn to a reasonable scale, with topography depicted by two-foot contour intervals provided, however, that if ground slope is sufficiently steep for less frequent contour intervals to show the surface configurations, the county board of health may permit the use of lesser contour intervals. Plans shall illustrate the location of all present and proposed wells, watercourses, floodplains, water systems, sewage systems, roads, structures, rights-of-way, and easements on the property. Subdivision or mobile home park plans shall also include, stormwater drainage systems, elevations of seasonable high-water table, location and results of test borings and percolation tests if applicable, lot identification, dimensions and building lines. The name and registration number of the preparing surveyor or engineer shall also be on the subdivision or mobile home park plans. 
                  (d)  Soil evaluation. Data used to develop soil maps and descriptions shall be obtained from reliable sources as set forth in section 70-231. Where reliable soil information or the services of a soil scientist are not available, percolation tests, soil borings, and such other tests as the county board of health may require shall be conducted. 
                  (e)  Limits on use of on-site sewage management systems in subdivision and mobile home parks. Approval of subdivisions and mobile home parks for on-site sewage management systems are not granted when: 
                  (1)  An available sewer of a public or community sewage treatment system is within 500 feet of the subdivision or mobile home park. 
                  (2)  Soil maps, descriptions and reports compiled by the Soil Conservation Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, or a soil scientist indicate that soil conditions prohibit safe development with on-site sewage management systems, or the average percolation rate for the subdivision or mobile home park is more than 90 minutes per inch. 
                  (f)  Drainage. Where on-site sewage management systems are proposed for use, an adequate surface water drainage system shall be provided for the proper drainage of all surface water. Plans for drainage shall comply with local storm drainage plans and policies in effect in the city and/or county at the time of submission to the county board of health, and approval of drainage plans by the local governing body is a prerequisite to the county board of health's approval. Additionally, any changes or amendments to approved drainage plans must receive the concurrence of the governing agency, and the county board of health shall be provided with a written approval statement from the governing agency. In the absence of local drainage policies, the county board of health will evaluate drainage plans and render decisions on their acceptability. Plans for internal drainage (subsurface drainage), if used, shall be submitted to the county board of health for consideration as to their acceptability. 
                  (g)  Water supply. A public water supply shall be required if, available within 1,000 feet of the proposed subdivision or mobile home park. 
                  (h)  Percolation tests. Where required for planning purposes and determination of the general absorption capacity of soils, the number of percolation tests to be made shall be one per lot, in the area where absorption fields are to be located. Preparatory to construction of on-site sewage management systems, individual lots within the proposed development shall comply with sections 70-223—70-231. 
                  (i)  Test borings. Where required for planning purposes, test borings to determine groundwater elevations and subsurface rock formations shall be made at locations, in numbers and at depths to be determined by the county board of health.

                  Sec. 74-31. - Title; purpose. 
                  This article shall be known as the "Wetland Protection Ordinance of Lincoln County, Georgia." The purpose of this article is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this article is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic nature and wildlife habitat. 
                  (Ord. No. 40, § 1.2, 4-12-2001) 
                  Sec. 74-32. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The wetlands within the county are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state. 
                  (b)  Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
                  (c)  It is therefore necessary for the county to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities that may adversely affect wetlands.

The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the county and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.

                  DIVISION 3. - LOCAL DEVELOPMENT PERMITS 

                  Sec. 74-71. - Requirements. 
                  No regulated activity will be allowed within the wetland protection district without written permission from the county in the form of a local development permit. Issuance of a local development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. All activities that are not identified in section 74-72 shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a local development permit. If the area proposed for development is located within 200 feet of the wetland protection district boundary, as determined by the office of planning and zoning or authorized designee using the generalized wetland map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site and that a section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, a local development permit will be issued only following issuance of the Section 404 Permit or Letter of Permission. The locally appointed enforcement official shall be responsible for coordinating the necessary permitting process between the applicant and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

                  (6)  Education, scientific research and nature trails. 
                  (b)  Temporary emergency permit. A temporary emergency permit can be issued by the county for the following reasons: 
                  (1)  Maintenance or repair of lawfully located roads or structures and of facilities used in the service of the public to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telegraph, telecommunication or other services, provided that such roads, structures, or facilities are not materially changed or enlarged and written notice prior to the commencement of work has been given to the county and provided that the work is conducted using best management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns and chemical and biological characteristics of the wetland are not impaired and that any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be minimized. 
                  (2)  Temporary water-level stabilization measures associated with ongoing silvicultural operations. 
                  (3)  Limited ditching, tilling, dredging, excavating or filling done solely for the purpose of maintaining or repairing existing drainage systems necessary for the cultivation of agricultural crops, provided that the maintenance or repair activity does not result in the impairment, alteration or loss of wetlands not previously subject to agricultural and silvicultural use under the terms and provisions of subsection (a)(4) of this section. 
                  (4)  Limited excavating and filling necessary for the repair and maintenance of piers, walkways, nature trails, observation decks, wildlife management shelters, boathouses or other similar water-related structures, provided that they are built on pilings to allow unobstructed flow of water and preserve the natural contour of the wetland. 
                  (c)  Prohibited uses. The following uses shall be prohibited within a wetland protection district: 
                  (1)  Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants. 
                  (2)  Hazardous or sanitary waste landfills.

                  Any subdivision that includes jurisdictional wetlands shall be allowed and encouraged to use the following options: 
                  (1)  Lot size averaging. Lot size averaging is encouraged in single-family detached subdivisions as a means to work around wetlands. The county may allow a reduction in lot size provided that the same number of lots in the same subdivision are oversized by an equal or greater area. The maximum permissible reduction shall not exceed 25 percent of the minimum required lot area. The number of lots with areas reduced shall not exceed 25 percent of the total number of lots in the subdivision. The county shall require no more than a 25-percent adjustment of side, rear and front setbacks for each affected lot. 
                  (2)  Cluster development. Clustering of residential development is encouraged. When considering subdivision approval, the county will allow incorporation of wetland or other significant natural areas as open space in the subdivision plan. Such plans should designate at least 25 percent of the gross land area as open space. Density shall be calculated by subtracting from the total acreage of a parcel all land dedicated or in use for private or public roads, including all vehicular rights-of-way. The resultant acreage will then be divided by the minimum allowed lot size of the district to derive the number of lots permissible.
