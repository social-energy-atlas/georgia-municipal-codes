            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Gray, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the mayor and council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Palmer Carr, Supervising Editor, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Joan W. Harris, City Attorney, and Ms. Loretta Lipsey, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  Sec. 10-56. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses, including but not limited to adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses (as demonstrated by the experiences of other municipalities, including but not limited to Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; Seattle and Renton, Washington; New York, New York; Los Angeles, California; and Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida) will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition. Otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult dance establishments, this article represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the surrounding neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.

                  Sec. 18-32. - Administrative procedures and penalties. 
                  (a)  Purpose. This article is hereby declared to be remedial, and shall be constructed to secure the beneficial interest and purposes thereof, which are public safety, health, general welfare, through structural strength, stability, sanitation, adequate light and ventilation and safety to life and property from fire and other hazards attributed to the built environment including alteration, repair, removal, demolition, use and occupancy of buildings, structures or premises, and by regulating the installation and maintenance of all electrical, gas, mechanical and plumbing systems, which may be referred to as service systems. 
                  (b)  Permitting and inspection. The inspection or permitting of any building, system or plan by any jurisdiction, under the requirements of this article, shall not be construed in any court as a warranty of the physical condition of such building, system or plan of their adequacy.

                  (j)  Violation of code provisions. The building official may revoke a permit, upon determination by the building official, that the construction, erection, alteration, repair, moving, demolition, installation or replacement of the building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing systems for which the permit was issued is in violation of, or not in conformity with, the provisions of this article. 
                  (k)  Permit application. Any owner, authorized agent or contractor who desires to construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move, demolish, or change the occupancy of a building or structure, or to erect, install, enlarge, alter, repair, remove, convert or replace any electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system, the installation of which is regulated by the technical codes, or to cause any such work to be done, shall first make application to the building official and obtain the required permit for the work. 
                  (l)  Violations and penalties. Any person, firm, corporation or agent who shall violate a provision of this article or fail to comply therewith or with any of the requirements thereof, or who shall meet, construct, alter, install, demolish or move any structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system or has erected, constructed, altered, repaired, moved or demolished a building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system, in violation of a detailed statement or drawing submitted and permitted thereunder shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Such person shall be considered guilty of a separate offense for each and every day or portion thereof during which any violation of any of the provisions of this Code is committed or continued, and upon conviction of any such violation such person shall be punished within the limits and as provided by state laws. 
                  (m)  Prescribed fees. A permit shall not be issued until the fees prescribed in the schedule of fees and charges have been paid, nor shall an amendment to a permit be released until the additional fee, if any, due to an increase in the estimated cost of the building, structure, electrical, plumbing, mechanical or gas systems, has been paid. 
                  (n)  Accounting. The building official shall keep a permanent and accurate accounting of all permit fees and other monies collected, the name of all persons upon whose account the same was paid, along with the date and amount thereof. 
                  (o)  Building permit valuations. If, in the opinion of the building official, the valuation of building, alteration, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing systems appears to be underestimated on the application, permit shall be denied, unless the applicant can show detailed estimates to meet the approval of the building official. Permit valuations shall include total cost, such as electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing equipment and other systems, including materials and labor.

                  (3)  Continuance.

                  3.  The police chief (see section 34-42(a)(4)a.1.) is authorized to execute a right of entry and/or agreement to use property for these purposes on behalf of the city; however, any such document shall be later presented for ratification by the city governing authority. 
                  4.  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the city who requests entry for purposes of evaluating sites involved with emergency management functions to protect the health, safety, or welfare of the public, and who presents appropriate credentials. Nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while that individual is in the process of carrying out his or her official duties.

                  7.  To suspend any law, code provision or regulation prescribing the procedures for conduct of city business, or the orders, rules or regulations of any city agency, if strict compliance with any ordinance, resolution, order, rule or regulation would in any way prevent, hinder or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency or disaster, provided that such suspension shall provide for the minimum deviation from the requirements under the circumstances and further provided that, when practicable, specialists shall be assigned to avoid adverse effects resulting from such suspension; 
                  8.  To provide benefits to citizens upon execution of an intergovernmental agreement for grants to meet disaster-related necessary expenses or serious needs of individuals or families adversely affected by an emergency or disaster in cases where the individuals or families are unable to meet the expenses or needs from other means, provided that such grants are authorized only when matching state or federal funds are available for such purposes;

Each day any such entity does business in the city without complying with this article constitutes a separate offense. 
                  (b)  The cost of registration fees in a declared emergency or disaster is fixed at $50.00 per annum. Registration is nontransferable. The cost of the emergency building permit shall be equal to the cost for a building permit under existing regulations. The permit shall only be authorized for repairs.

                  Sec. 38-34. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to of O.C.G.A. 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regarding and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 38-34(b)(2) of this section; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25 foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along with any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50 foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25 foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsection (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

                  Sec. 38-35 - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall review the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this ordinance, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the zoning enforcement officer/planning and zoning office to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the zoning enforcement officer/planning and zoning office and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 38-34(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by four copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-5-23(5)(a), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. A district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 38-34(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per section 38-35(b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement, which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application.

If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 38-34(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices.

The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 38-34(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per section 38-35(b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of the ordinance codified in this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. 12-7-7(f)(1).

                  ARTICLE V. - ILLICIT STORM SEWER SYSTEM DISCHARGE AND ILLEGAL CONNECTION 

                  Sec. 38-150. - Purpose and intent. 
                  (a)  It is hereby determined that: 
                  Discharges to the city's storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased non-point source pollution and degradation of receiving waters. These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the city's storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments. These non-stormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters. The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters. These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the city's storm sewer system. 
                  Therefore, the city adopts this article to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the city's storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the city's storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment. 
                  The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare through the regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the city's storm sewer system to the maximum extent practicable as required by state and federal law. This article establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the city's storm sewer system in order to among other requirements comply with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process. The objectives of this article are to: 
                  (1)  Regulate the contribution of pollutants to the city's storm sewer system by any person; 
                  (2)  Prohibit illicit discharges and illegal connections to the city's storm sewer system; 
                  (3)  Prevent non-stormwater discharges, generated as a result of spills, inappropriate dumping or disposal, to the city's storm sewer system; and, 
                  (4)  To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance, monitoring and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this article. 
                  (b)  Compatibility with other regulations. This article is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law. The requirements of this article are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control.

                  ARTICLE VI. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT, REDEVELOPMENT, AND POST-DEVELOPMENT 

                  Sec. 38-170. - Purpose and intent. 
                  (a)  It is hereby determined that: 
                  Land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition; 
                  Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased non-point source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
                  The impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
                  These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment, by the use of both structural facilities as well as non-structural measures, such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or credits; 
                  Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and non-point source pollution; 
                  Therefore, the city has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of development stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and non-point source pollution associated with development stormwater runoff. 
                  (b)  The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and non-point source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. These standards for the design of storm drainage systems are established to forestall flooding and ponding of water on streets, lots, building sites, dwellings and sites for drain fields of subsurface sewage disposal systems and to prevent erosion. In addition, these standards are designed to prevent damage from increased water runoff and changed drainage patterns created by the subdivision of land. It has been determined that proper management of development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
                  (1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
                  (2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, non-point source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
                  (3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
                  (4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
                  (5)  Encourage the use of non-structural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace; 
                  (6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and non-structural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and 
                  (7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up.

                  (3)  Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is defined by the city to be a hotspot land use; or 
                  (4)  Land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth in items (1) and (2) above if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. 
                  (b)  The following activities are exempt from this article: 
                  (1)  Individual single-family or duplex residential lots that are not part of a subdivision or phased development project; 
                  (2)  Additions or modifications to existing single-family or duplex residential structures;

                  Sec. 38-173. - Drainage and stormwater management systems. 
                  The size of storm sewers shall not be based solely on present needs, but rather on a regional perspective, taking into account the population density of the drainage basin. The city may require the subdivider to provide storm and floodwater runoff channels or natural storage basins, such as tanks, infiltration pits, dry wells, or gravel layers independent of the sanitary sewer system based on the location of the subdivision. Where detention facilities are deemed necessary, they should accommodate site runoff generated by the two year, ten year and 100 year storms considered individually. Detention shall be provided such that after development, the peak rate of flow from the site will not exceed the corresponding flows, which have been created by similar storms prior to the development. 
                  A subdivision plan that minimizes paved areas and other impervious surfaces and attempts to preserve existing vegetation will decrease the need for expensive water retention measures. 
                  All storm drainage design shall be planned and executed so as to preserve natural topographic features and vegetative cover, to minimize change to existing topography, and to preserve natural drainage systems. 
                  (1)  Where an adequate public storm sewer is available at the plat boundary, the subdivider shall construct a stormwater management system and connect with such storm sewer line. If such a stormwater management system is not accessible, natural drainage channels with easements of adequate width shall be provided as determined and approved by the city. Storm drainage from lots, including drain tile around basements shall not be permitted to discharge into any sanitary sewer facility, but shall connect to an adequate drainage outlet. 
                  (2)  The subdivider shall construct all necessary facilities including underground pipes, inlets, catch basins, or open drainage ditches, as determined by the city, to provide for the adequate disposal of subsurface and surface water and maintenance of natural drainage courses. The best available technology (BAT) shall be used to minimize off-site stormwater runoff, increase onsite filtration, encourage natural filtration functions, simulate natural drainage systems and minimize off-site discharge of pollutants to ground and surface water. Best available technology (BAT) may include measures such as retention basins, recharge trenches, porous paving and piping, contour terraces and swales. Stormwater management shall follow the standards established by the State of Georgia Environmental Protection Division. Subdivision development shall not increase the rate of runoff and an increase in the volume of runoff shall require a reduction in the rate of runoff. 
                  (3)  When necessary, outlet ditches of closed storm sewers on an approved type and size shall be required as part of the construction. If same is across private property, rights-of-way or easements shall be obtained by the subdivider for the construction and future maintenance. These rights-of-way or easements shall be shown on the construction plans. Whenever possible, post development drainage patterns shall be the same as pre-development drainage patterns. The design of streets and grading shall be such that runoff from roofs, driveways and other impervious surfaces will be collected in ditches and/or gutters in short runs 300 feet to 400 feet in length. The runoff shall then be diverted from the surface, if not already underground, into storm sewers or a natural watercourse. Streets shall be located away from watercourses unless storm sewers are to be installed. The channel downstream of the subdivision shall be improved adequately by the subdivider to convey the storm runoff from the subdivision and across the adjacent property owner so that damages from flooding are minimized. 
                  (4)  The subdivider shall guard against the creation or continuation of swampy areas or stagnant pools, unless they are a component of a designed wetlands open space. The city may require fill, swale and/or channel improvements in order to forestall such problems. 
                  (5)  Adequate measures for the protection of open and closed drainage channels shall be provided. Maintenance easements widths shall be determined by the city. The velocity flow on an open ditch shall not exceed four feet per second in soil ditches or six feet per second in grassed ditches. Paved ditches will be required if velocities of flow are greater than those specified, or if it is otherwise likely that destructive erosion will result. Drainage ditches shall not be permitted to discharge into any sanitary sewer facility. 
                  (6)  No watercourse shall be altered in such a way as to change the amount or direction of flow; no fill, building or structures shall be situated in natural water courses unless provision is made for the flow of water in a manner satisfactory to the city. 
                  (7)  Maintenance of all stormwater management systems shall remain the responsibility of the owner.

                  Sec. 38-178. - Post-development stormwater management. 
                  Performance criteria. The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this article: 
                  (a)  Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
                  (1)  It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; 
                  (2)  Appropriate structural stormwater controls or non-structural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and 
                  (3)  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the city are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, non-structural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
                  (b)  Stream channel protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches: 
                  (1)  Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer; 
                  (2)  Twenty-four-hour extended detention storage of the one year, 24-hour return frequency storm event; 
                  (3)  Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control. 
                  (c)  Overbank flooding protection. Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25 year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, 24-hour storm under subsection (b) is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided. 
                  (d)  Extreme flooding protection. Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. 
                  (e)  Structural stormwater controls. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the city before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the city may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased non-point source pollution loads created on the site in question. 
                  Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
                  (f)  Stormwater credits for non-structural measures. The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under subsection (a). The applicant may, if approved by the city, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
                  (g)  Drainage system guidelines.

                  Sec. 38-200. - Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and objectives. 
                  (a)  Authorization. Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and Section 36-1-20(a) of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the mayor and city council, of Gray, Georgia, do ordain as follows: 
                  (b)  Findings of fact. 
                  (1)  The flood hazard areas of Gray, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (2)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (c)  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  (d)  Objectives. The objectives of this article are: 
                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  (e)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing ordinance, easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this article and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
                  (f)  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this article all provisions shall be: (1) considered as minimum requirements; (2) liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and (3) deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
                  (g)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of city or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
                  (h)  Penalties for violation. Failure to comply with the provisions of this article or with any of its requirements, including conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions shall constitute a violation. Any person who violates this article or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $1,000.00 or imprisoned for not more than six months, or both, and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense.

                  Sec. 38-203. - Provisions for flood hazard reduction. 
                  (a)  General standards. In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and, 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area, and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters; 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding, and; 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the non-conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
                  (b)  Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one-foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 38-203(a)(4), "elevated buildings." 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one-foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Non-residential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one-foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 38-202(c)(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one-foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one-foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. section 38-203(a)(6) above) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring and elevation requirements of section 38-203(b)(3)c., above. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 38-201(b), are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if section 38-203(b)(4)a. above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of section 38-203. 
                  (c)  Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 38-201 (b), where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 38-201(b), then the zoning enforcement officer shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of section 38-203, only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2) and (3) shall apply. 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one-foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (Note: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one-foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 38-203(a)(4) "elevated buildings." 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  The zoning enforcement officer shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (d)  Standards for areas of special flood hazard (zones AE) with established base flood elevations without designated floodways. Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 38-201(b), where streams with base flood elevations are provided but no floodways have been designated, (zones AE) the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one-foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 
                  (2)  New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or flood-proofed to elevations established in accordance with section 38-203(b). 
                  (e)  Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). Areas of special flood hazard established in section 38-201(b), may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and non-residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 38-203(a)(4), "elevated buildings." 
                  The zoning enforcement officer shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a non-residential structure may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one-foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in section 38-202(b)(1)c. and (b)(2). 
                  (3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure. 
                  (f)  Standards for subdivisions. 
                  (1)  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
                  (2)  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
                  (3)  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards, and; 
                  (4)  For subdivisions and/or developments greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less, base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions. Any changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted to FEMA for review as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. Upon completion of the project, the developer is responsible for submitting the "as-built" data to FEMA in order to obtain the final LOMR. 
                  (g)  Standards for critical facilities. 
                  (1)  Critical facilities shall not be located in the 100-year floodplain or the 500-year floodplain. 
                  (2)  All ingress and egress from any critical facility must be protected to the 500-year flood elevation.

                  Sec. 38-204. - Variance procedures. 
                  (a)  The mayor and city council of the city shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the zoning enforcement officer in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the mayor and council of the city may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Jones County, as provided in section 5-4-1 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the mayor and council of the city shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause, 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The zoning enforcement officer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the mayor and council of the city may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic sructure means any structure that is:

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: Accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. Note: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  Sec. 38-306. - Procedure for declaring dwelling unfit. 
                  (a)  (1)  Whenever a request is filed with the public officer by a public authority or by at least five residents of the municipality charging that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer shall make an investigation or inspection of the specific dwelling, building, structure, or property. If the officer's investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer may issue a complaint in rem against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building, or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general nuisance exists and shall cause summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the interested parties for such dwelling, building, or structure. The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; identify the interested parties; state with particularity the factual basis for the action; and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. The summons shall notify the interested parties that a hearing will be held before a court of competent jurisdiction as determined by O.C.G.A. § 41-2-5, at a date and time certain and at a place within the city where the property is located. Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days nor more than 45 days after the filing of said complaint in the proper court. The interested parties shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for hearing; 
                  (2)  If, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state in writing findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order: 
                  a.  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it up into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  b.  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property. 
                  For purposes of this article, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. § 43-39A-1 et seq., qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the city. 
                  (3)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure the public officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved or to be vacated and closed or demolished. Such abatement action shall commence within 270 days after the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or Section 38-307 of this article, or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action must commence. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
                   "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe condition. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful."; 
                  (4)  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and governing authority are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials; and 
                  (5)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
                  (b)  (1)  The lien provided for in paragraph (a)(5) of this section shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court in the county where the real property is located and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12(c) and section 38-305(c) of this chapter. The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except all liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. 
                  (2)  Upon final determination of costs, fees, and expenses incurred in accordance with this article, the public officer responsible for enforcement actions in accordance with this article shall transmit to the appropriate county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer a statement of the total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all notices provided to interested parties. The statement of the public officer shall be transmitted within 90 days of completion of the repairs, demolition, or closure. It shall be the duty of the appropriate county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer, who is responsible or whose duties include the collection of municipal taxes, to collect the amount of the lien using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. tit. 48, ch. 4; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. A county tax commissioner shall collect and enforce municipal liens imposed pursuant to the article in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 48-5-359.1. The county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the county or municipality whose lien is being collected. 
                  (3)  Enforcement of liens pursuant to this article may be initiated at any time following receipt by the county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer of the final determination of costs in accordance with this article. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. An enforcement proceeding pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this chapter. 
                  (4)  The redemption amount in any enforcement proceeding pursuant to this article shall be the full amount of the costs as finally determined in accordance with this article together with interest, penalties, and costs incurred by the governing authority, county tax commissioner, municipal tax collector, or city revenue officer in the enforcement of such lien. Redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. 
                  (c)  The governing authority may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the county or municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
                  (d)  Where the abatement action does not commence in the superior court, review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29. 
                  (e)  In addition to the procedures and remedies in this chapter, a governing authority may provide by ordinance that designated public officers may issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted by ordinance, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and seek to enforce such citations in a court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this article. 
                  (f)  Nothing in this article shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings.

                  (3)  Cause such area by reason of such factors to constitute a visibly perceptible section of the municipality or county.

                  (b)  A person engages in disorderly conduct when he does the following: 
                  (1)  Any person who shall act in a violent or tumultuous manner toward another person, whereby such other person is reasonably placed in fear of the safety of his life, limb or health. 
                  (2)  Any person who shall act in a violent or tumultuous manner toward another person, whereby the property of such other person is placed in danger of being destroyed or damaged.

                  (4)  Any person who loiters or remains upon any premises to which the public has access, including but not limited to such places as business and shopping area parking lots, where the person's presence is unrelated to the normal activity, use or business for which such premises are made available to the public.

                  Sec. 42-4. - Loitering. 
                  (a)  A person commits the offense of loitering when he is in a place, without authority or permission to be in such place, at a time or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity. 
                  (b)  Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon the appearance of a law enforcement officer, refuses to identify himself, or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or any object. Unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or immediate concern which would otherwise be warranted by requesting the person to identify himself and explain his presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this section if the law enforcement officer fails to comply with the foregoing procedure, or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and, would have dispelled the alarm or immediate concern. Repeated incidents of parking or standing on private property by a person after being previously warned by an officer to leave, without authority or permission to remain on such property and without any legitimate purpose or business related to the private property, shall be considered circumstances that would warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm for the safety of the property. Littering and the use or distribution of controlled substances shall both be considered acts which would violate the safety of persons or property.

                  ARTICLE II. - CURFEW 

                  Sec. 42-36. - Findings. 
                  Based upon demonstrated experiences of the city and other urban counties and municipalities, and upon evidence presented to the mayor and council by city councilmen and the police chief of the city, who are familiar with conditions resulting from minors being on or about the streets and other public places unsupervised between the hours of midnight and 5:00 a.m. and the conditions resulting from such unsupervised activity, the mayor and council of the city take note that it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety, morals and preservation of the citizens of the city to provide for a curfew article. It is the intent of this curfew article to protect minors from one another and others while they are out on the streets and other public places, to enforce parental control of and responsibility for their children, and to protect the public from the nocturnal mischief or criminal activity of minors. The city finds that a curfew ordinance will promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interest such as reducing criminal activity, protecting against property devaluation and deterioration and eliminating undesirable community conditions and that such article will not infringe upon the protected constitutional rights of freedom of speech, expression or travel. To that end, this section is hereby adopted.

                  (1)  Grease traps shall have grease retention capacity as indicated, below, in the Uniform Plumbing Code. 

                   

                   
                  (g)  General requirements for grease interceptors. 
                  (1)  Grease interceptors shall be installed by users as required by the city superintendent or his designee. Grease interceptors shall be installed at the user's expense, when such user operates a cooking establishment. Grease interceptors may also be required in noncooking or cold dairy and frozen foodstuffs establishments and other industrial or commercial establishments when they are deemed necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease. All grease interceptors shall be of a type, design and capacity approved by the city superintendent or his designee and shall be readily and easily accessible for user cleaning and inspection by the city. All such grease interceptors shall be serviced and emptied of accumulated waste content as required in order to maintain minimum design capability or effective volume of the grease interceptor, but not less often than every 30 days. Users who are required to pass water through a grease interceptor shall: 
                  a.  Provide for a minimum hydraulic retention time of 24 minutes at actual peak flow or 12 minutes at the calculated theoretical peak flow rate as predicted by the Uniform Plumbing Code fixture criteria, between the influent and effluent baffles with 20 percent of the total volume of the grease interceptor being allowed for sludge to settle and accumulate, identified hereafter as a "sludge pocket". 
                  b.  Remove any accumulated grease cap and sludge pocket as required, but at intervals of not longer than 30 days at the users expense. Grease interceptors shall be kept free of inorganic solid materials such as grit, rocks, gravel, sand, eating utensils, cigarettes, shells, towels, rags, etc., which could settle into this pocket and thereby reduce the effective volume of the grease interceptor. 
                  c.  Accept the following conditions: If any skimmed or pumped wastes or other materials removed from grease interceptor are treated in any fashion onsite and reintroduced back into the grease interceptor as an activity of and after said onsite treatment, the user shall be responsible for the attainment of established grease numerical limit consistent with and contained in subsection (f)(1) on all discharges of wastewater from said grease interceptor into the city's wastewater collection system. 
                  d.  Operate the grease interceptor in a manner so as to maintain said device such that attainment of the grease limit is consistently achieved. "Consistent" shall mean any wastewater sample taken from said grease interceptor shall be subject to terms of numerical limit attainment described in subsection (f)(1). If an establishment desires, because of documented space constraints, an alternate to an out-of-building grease interceptor, the request for an alternative location shall contain the following information: 
                  1.  Location of city sewer main and easement in relation to available exterior space outside the building. 
                  2.  Existing plumbing at or on a site that uses common plumbing for all services at that site. 
                  e.  Understand and agree that: The use of biological additives as a grease degradation agent is conditionally permissible, upon prior written approval by the city superintendent or his designee. Any establishment using this method of grease abatement shall maintain the trap or interceptor in such a manner that attainment of the grease wastewater discharge limit, as measured from the trap's outlet, is consistently achieved. 
                  f.  Understand and agree that: The use of automatic grease removal systems is conditionally permissible, upon prior written approval by the city superintendent or his designee, the plumbing inspector for the city and the Jones County Health Department. Any establishment using this equipment shall operate the system in such a manner that attainment of the grease wastewater discharge limit, as measured from the unit's outlet, is consistently achieved. 
                  g.  Understand and agree that: The city reserves the right to make determinations of grease interceptor adequacy and need, based on review of all relevant information regarding grease interceptor performance, facility site and building plan review and to require repairs to, or modification or replacement of such traps. 
                  (h)  Alternative methods. 
                  (1)  Alternative technology/methods. Engineered alternative technology or methods may be permitted, provided the technology or method meets the minimum performance standards set forth by this section or by the city. 
                  (2)  Biological or chemical treatment agents. The use of biological or chemical treatment agents may be allowed in addition to, but not in lieu of, required grease removal systems, provided the user supplier verification that discharge requirements are being met. To verify compliance, beginning 90 days from the last trap cleaning, the discharge must be sampled four times within 24 hours during the hours of operation and analyzed for oil and grease concentrations. In addition, the depth of bottom and top solids must be measured. This testing must be performed monthly and the results submitted to the city within the same testing month. When the oil and grease concentrations exceed the city's daily maximum discharge limits and/or the combined depth of bottom and top solids exceeds 50 percent of the total depth of the trap, the trap must be cleaned and the process started again. 
                  (i)  User responsibility. 
                  (1)  User responsibility and acknowledgment. 
                  a.  Users that are required to install a fats, oils and grease recovery system shall be responsible for the cleaning and maintenance of the fats, oils and grease recovery systems located on the property. The user shall be responsible for maintaining any grease recovery system pursuant to subsection b. below and in such a manner that the grease discharge shall not exceed the city's discharge limits. The currently adopted limits shall be on file at the office of the city clerk and at the office of the city superintendent. 
                  b.  The user shall maintain accurate records (manifests and logs) of the dates of cleaning and the means of disposal of fats, oils and grease. These records are subject to inspection and review by the city pursuant to and in accordance with subsection (d). 
                  c.  Any removal and hauling of fats, oils and grease shall be performed by a licensed waste disposal or rendering firm. If the grease recovery system fails to prevent discharge over the daily maximum, the city will require the user to repair, replace or upgrade their grease removal system, which may include one or more of the user's devices, at the user's expense. 
                  d.  All costs related to the building's sewer installation, grease recovery system or connection and registration shall be borne by the user. 
                  e.  The user shall be required to sign an acknowledgment form furnished by the city attesting to the user's understanding of the aforementioned responsibility. 
                  (2)  Grease trap maintenance. 
                  a.  All grease traps shall be maintained by the user at the user's expense. Maintenance shall include the complete recovery of all contents, including floating materials, wastewater and bottom sludges and solids. All grease recovery systems, including passive exterior devices, and any grease recovery devices, shall be properly and adequately maintained by the user so as to achieve the intended purpose of the device. 
                  b.  In the maintaining of these grease recovery systems, the user shall be responsible for proper recovery, removal and disposal by appropriate, approved means of the captured material by a licensed waste disposal or rendering firm. 
                  c.  Pumping/cleaning frequency. All PEDs shall be completely pumped out at a minimum of once every three months, or more frequently as required by the city to comply with this section or the manufacturer's recommendation. The frequency of removal shall be such as to ensure that no overflows of oils or grease into the wastewater collection system ever results. Decanting or discharging of removed waste back into the trap from which the waste was removed or to any other grease trap or sanitary sewer connection for the purpose of reducing the volume to be hauled is prohibited. 
                  (j)  Enforcement. 
                  (1)  Monitoring. The user shall install a manhole on the discharge sewer to allow observation, sampling and measurement of grease recovery system discharges. Access manholes, with a minimum diameter of 24 inches, shall be provided over each chamber and sanitary tee. The access manholes shall extend at least to the finished grade and be designed and maintained to prevent water inflow or infiltration. The manholes shall also have readily removable covers to facilitate inspection, grease removal, and wastewater sampling. Each manhole shall contain a properly installed flow monitoring device. Plans of the proposed sampling manhole and monitoring device shall be prepared by a registered engineer and submitted to the city. 
                  (2)  Inspection and entry. Any authorized representative of the city bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to enter and inspect all properties without prior notification. This right of inspection shall include the right to measure, observe, monitor, sample, test, record, review and make copies of all pertinent documents in accordance with this section. 
                  (k)  Violations and penalties. 
                  (1)  Violations. It shall be unlawful for any user to discharge water into the city's wastewater collection system in a manner in violation of this section, or of any conditions set forth herein. Any person who violates any provision of this section shall, in addition to the penalties specified herein, be subject to the provisions contained in the city's sewer use ordinance to the extent such violations, notice and penalties are not addressed in this section. 
                  (2)  Notice of noncompliance. If through inspection, it is determined that the user has failed to comply with the provisions of this section, a written warning of the violation shall be given to the user, the contractor named in the permit, or the user's authorized agent. The notice shall set forth the violation and the measure needed to achieve compliance. The user shall have seven days from receipt of this notice to comply. Where an emergency exists, a written warning shall be given to the user, and the user will have 24 hours to comply. 
                  (3)  Failure to comply. The city shall have the power and authority to enter upon the property of any user who, after having received a written warning, has failed to comply with the provisions of this section, and take the following actions as outlined in the city's sewer use ordinance, approved by the Georgia Environmental Protection Division on December 21, 1989: 
                  a.  The city may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater contribution permit when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the city, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes interference to the POTW or causes the city to violate any condition of its NPDES permit. 
                  Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city shall take such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The city may reinstate the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the user describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the city within 15 days of the date of the occurrence. 
                  b.  Whenever, the city finds that any user has violated or is violating this section and the sewer use ordinance, or any prohibition, limitation of requirements contained herein, the city may serve upon such person a written notice stating the nature of the violation. Within 30 days of the date of the notice, a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the city by the user. 
                  c.  If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes or other wastes into the city's wastewater disposal system contrary to the provisions of this section and the sewer use ordinance, federal or state pretreatment requirements, or any order of the city, the city attorney may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the superior court of this county. 
                  (4)  Penalty. 
                  a.  Any user who is found to have violated any provision of this section, and the orders, rules, and regulations issued hereunder, shall be fined in the municipal court of the city a fine of not less than $300.00. Each day on which a violation shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense. 
                  b.  Any person who knowingly makes any false statements, representation or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this section and the sewer use ordinance, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this section or the sewer use ordinance, shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 or by imprisonment for not more than six months, or by both. 
                  (5)  Overflow penalty. Any sewer or manhole overflow traced to an inadequately operating grease recovery system or lack of a grease recovery system will result in a service charge to the user. The service charge shall include the cost of cleaning up the overflow and for cleaning grease out of the immediately adjacent contaminated city wastewater collection system. This penalty shall not impede other enforcement actions as deemed appropriate by the city. Additionally, the user shall be responsible for payment of any fine levied by the Georgia Environmental Protection Division against the city as a result of overflows in the city's wastewater collection system caused by grease traced to any inadequate or absent grease recovery system. 
                  (l)  [Delayed enforcement action; system obstruction.] Except as provided herein, for a period of one year following adoption of this section, although installation of grease interceptors will be required to be installed, no enforcement actions will be taken under this section for failure to achieve limits on grease discharges from grease interceptors. If during this one-year period an obstruction of a city sewer main(s) occurs that causes a sewer overflow to the extent that an impact on the environment is realized and that said overflow or failure of the sanitary sewer collection system to convey sewage can be attributed in part or in whole to an accumulation of grease in the city's sewer main(s), the city will take appropriate enforcement actions, as stipulated in the city's sewer use ordinance, against the generator or contributor of such grease. 
                  (m)  In the event there is any conflict between the provisions of this section and the provisions of the Standard Plumbing Code (SBCCI) incorporated by reference in section 18-31, the provisions of this section shall take precedence.

                  ARTICLE IV. - ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICTS 

                  Section 41. - Division of the city into districts. 
                  For the purpose of this ordinance, the City of Gray, Georgia, is divided into eight [nine] districts as follows: 
                  R-1, single-family residential district. 
                  R-1A, single-family residential district. 
                  R-2, two-family residential district. 
                  R-3, multifamily residential district. 
                  C-1, neighborhood commercial. 
                  C-2, general commercial district. 
                  C-3, entertainment commercial district. 
                  M-1, wholesale and light industrial district. 
                  M-2, industrial district. 
                  Section 42. - Incorporation of the zoning map. 
                  The sectional atlas property maps entitled "1970 Official Zoning Districts Maps for Gray, Georgia," revised in October and November of 1995, hereinafter called official zoning maps, with all notations, references and other information shown thereon shall be the official zoning maps and are hereby made a part of this ordinance. Said maps are hereby made a public record and shall be kept permanently in the zoning enforcement office for the City of Gray, where the maps will be accessible to the general public. 
                  Section 43. - Map amendment. 
                  If, in accordance with provisions of this ordinance, changes are made in the district boundaries or other information portrayed in the official zoning maps, changes shall be made on the official zoning maps promptly after the amendment has been approved by the council, together with a numerical entry on the official zoning maps referring to the application on file which states the date of the official action and the brief description of the nature of the changes. No amendment to this ordinance which involved matter portrayed on the official zoning maps shall become effective until after such change and entry have been made on said maps. 
                  Section 44. - Rules for determining boundaries. 
                  Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the aforesaid districts as shown on the official zoning maps, the following rules shall apply: 
                  44.1. Unless otherwise indicated, the district boundaries are indicated as approximately following property lines, land lot lines, centerlines of streets, highways, alleys or railroads, shorelines of streams, reservoirs, or other bodies of water, or civil boundaries, and they shall be construed to follow such lines. 
                  44.2. Where district boundaries are approximately parallel to the centerlines of streets, highways, or railroads, or right-of-way of the same, or the centerlines of streams, reservoirs, or other bodies of water, or said lines extended, such district boundaries shall be construedas being parallel thereto and at such distance therefrom as indicated on the official zoning maps. If no distance is given, such dimensions shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the official zoning maps. 
                  44.3. Where a district boundary line as appearing on the official zoning maps, divides a lot which is single ownership at the time of this enactment, the use classification of a larger portion may be extended to the remainder by the council without recourse to amendment procedure. 
                  44.4. Where a public road, street or alley is officially vacated or abandoned, the regulations applicable to the property to which it is reverted shall apply to such vacated or abandoned road, street or alley. 
                  44.5. In case the exact location of a boundary cannot be determined by the foregoing methods, the council shall, upon application, determine the location of the boundary. 
                  Section 45. - Comprehensiveness of zoning districts. 
                  The purpose of this ordinance is to place all portions of the City of Gray within specific zoning districts. Should any area of the city appear either by reference to the maps or by interpretation to be inadvertently or otherwise omitted from a classification district, that area or areas are hereby placed in an R-1 single-family residential district and are subject to all the regulations pertaining thereto until such time as the city council can determine its proper zoning district classification. 
                  ARTICLE V. - APPLICATION OF REGULATIONS 
                  Except as hereinafter provided: 

                  Section 51. - Use. 
                  No building or land shall hereafter be used or occupied and no building or part thereof shall be erected, constructed, moved, or altered except in conformity with the regulations herein specified for the district in which it is or is to be located. Any use not allowed as a permitted or conditional use within the applicable zoning district shall be deemed prohibited. No more than one principal use per lot shall be permitted except as provided herein.

                  No building shall hereafter be erected, constructed or altered so as to exceed the height limit, to accommodate or house a greater number of families than are required or specified in the regulations herein for the district in which it is located. 
                  52.1. Prohibitions. No building shall hereafter be erected, constructed, or altered as to exceed the maximum height, to house a greater number of families than is allowed, or to occupy a greater percentage of lot area than that allowed within the zoning district in which it is located, or in any other manner contrary to the provisions of this ordinance. 
                  52.2. Exceptions. The building height restrictions imposed on buildings and structures by the ordinance for each zoning district shall not apply to the following buildings or structures: 
                  52.21. Churches, schools, hospitals, sanitariums, and other public and quasi-public buildings, and public utility structures, provided that the front, rear, and side yards required in the district in which the structure is located be increased one foot for each ten feet that the building or structure exceeds the maximum height permitted in the zoning district. 
                  52.22. Barns, silos, grain elevators, other farm structures, belfries, cupolas, domes, monuments, water towers, transmission towers, windmills, chimneys, cooling towers, smokestacks, flagpoles, radio and television towers, masts, aerials, and similar structures.

                  53.1. Dimensions and area. No building or other structure shall hereafter be erected or altered to have smaller or narrower front yards, rear yards, side yards, or other spaces than herein required. 
                  53.2. Application of requirements for multiple structures. No part of a yard or other open space or off-street parking or loading space required about or in connection with any building for the purpose of complying with this ordinance shall be included as part of a yard, open space, or off-street parking or loading space similarly required for any other building. 
                  53.3. Reduction in area or dimension. No yard or lot existing at the time of passage of this ordinance shall be reduced in dimension or area below the minimum requirements set forth herein. Yards or lots created after the effective date of this ordinance shall meet at least the minimum requirements established by this article, except as may be allowed pursuant to the provisions of section 114.3. This section shall not apply when a portion of a lot is acquired for public use. 
                  53.4. Projection of buildings into required yards. No part of a yard or other open space required for any building for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this ordinance shall be included as part of a yard or other open space similarly required for another building. Every part of a required yard or court shall be open from its lowest point to the sky unobstructed, except for the ordinary projection of sills, cornices, buttresses, ornamental features, chimneys, flues, and eaves, provided such projections shall not extend more than two feet beyond the yard area requirements. 
                  ARTICLE VI. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

                  Section 61. - Nonconforming buildings and uses. 
                  Within the districts established by this ordinance or amendments that may later be adopted, there may exist lots, structures, uses of land and structures, and characteristics of use which were lawful before this ordinance was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this ordinance or future amendments. It is the intent of this ordinance to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this ordinance that nonconformities shall not be enlarged, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
                  61.1. Incompatibility of nonconforming uses. Nonconforming uses are declared by this ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts in which such uses are located. A nonconforming use of structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of a structure and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this ordinance by attachment on a building or premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would be generally prohibited in the district in which such use is located. Nonconforming uses shall not be changed to another nonconforming use without approval of the planning commission, and then only to a use which, in the opinion of the planning commission, is of the same or a more conforming nature. 
                  61.2. Avoidance of undue hardship. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance. 
                  61.3. Single nonconforming lots of record. A single lot of record which does not meet the requirements for area or width, or both that are applicable in the district existing at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance may be used or sold for the erection of those buildings and accessory buildings necessary to carry out the permitted uses in that district, provided: 
                  61.31. Yard dimensions and lot coverage requirements other than those applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located unless a variance has been granted. 
                  61.32. Variance for yard dimensions and lot coverage requirements shall be obtained only through action of the board of zoning appeals as provided for in section 114. 
                  61.33. Locational requirements of accessory buildings and uses are met as provided for in section 93.1. 
                  61.34. Parking space requirements for all districts as provided for in section 62.2. 
                  61.35. In residential districts, buildings shall be limited to single-family detached dwellings. 
                  61.36. Said lot cannot be combined with an adjoining undeveloped lot to create a single conforming lot for purposes of development. 
                  61.4. Nonconforming lots of record in combination. If two or more undeveloped lots or a combination of undeveloped lots and portions of undeveloped lots with contiguous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this ordinance and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this ordinance and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this ordinance nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with a width or area below the requirements stated in this ordinance. A lot is considered undeveloped if it has no substantial structures upon it. 
                  61.5. Nonconforming uses of land. Where, at the time of adoption of this ordinance, lawful uses of land exist which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this ordinance the uses may be continued so long as they remain otherwise lawful, provided: 
                  61.51. No such nonconforming uses shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance; 
                  61.52. No such nonconforming uses shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such uses at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance; 
                  61.53. If any such nonconforming uses of land are voluntarily discontinued for a period of more than 60 days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this ordinance for the district in which such land is located; and 
                  61.54. No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this ordinance shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land. 
                  61.6. Nonconforming structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance that could not be built under the terms of this ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, bulk, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
                  61.61. No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity. No such alterations or enlargement shall be, in and of itself, nonconforming. 
                  61.62. Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of structure be destroyed by any means to the extent of more than 50 percent of its current replacement value, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance. 
                  61.63. Should such structure be voluntarily moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which located after it is removed. 
                  61.64. This section shall not be construed to prohibit the replacement, addition to or improvement of a nonconforming manufactured or mobile home, provided that any replacement home meets all applicable federal, state, and local requirements, or said addition or improvement shall cause the house to more closely resemble a site-built structure, thus decreasing the appearance of nonconformity. Any replacement of a nonconforming manufactured or mobile home must be completed within 60 days of the removal of the nonconforming manufactured or mobile home. 
                  61.7. Nonconforming uses of structures or of structures and premises in combination. If a lawful use involving individual structures, or of a structure and premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this ordinance, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful; subject to the following provisions: 
                  61.71. No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this ordinance in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, voluntarily moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located; 
                  61.72. Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed; 
                  61.73. Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building; 
                  61.74. When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in combination is voluntarily discontinued or abandoned for more than 60 days (except when government action impedes access to the premises), the structure or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located; 
                  61.75. Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure to the extent of more than 50 percent of its current replacement value, shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. 
                  61.8. Repairs and maintenance. On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs including remodeling, or repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, provided that the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official. 
                  Section 62. - Off-street automobile parking. 
                  Off-street automobile storage or parking space shall be provided on every lot on which any permitted or conditional use is established in accordance with this ordinance. 
                  62.1. General requirements. For the purpose of this ordinance the following general requirements are specified: 
                  62.11. The term "off-street parking space" shall mean a space at least nine feet wide and 20 feet in length with a minimum net area of 180 square feet, excluding area for egress and ingress and maneuverability of vehicles. In parking areas containing ten or more total parking spaces, no more than 20 percent of the parking spaces may be at least 7½ feet wide and 15 feet in length. These smaller spaces shall be prominently designated as reserved for small or compact cars. 
                  62.12. If an off-street parking space cannot be reasonably provided on the same lot on which the principal use is conducted, the board of zoning appeals may permit such space to be provided on other off-street property, provided such space lies within 600 feet of the property line of such principal use. Such vehicle parking space shall be associated with the permitted use and shall not thereafter be reduced or encroached upon in any manner. 
                  62.13. The required number of parking spaces for any number of separate uses may be combined in one lot, but the required space assigned to another use at the same time, except that portion of the parking space required for existing church whose peak attendance will be at night or on Sundays may be assigned to a use which will be closed at nights or on Sundays. 
                  62.14. Area reserved for off-street parking in accordance with the requirements of this ordinance shall not be reduced in area or changed to any other use unless the permitted use which it serves is discontinued or modified, except where equivalent parking space is provided to the satisfaction of the board of zoning appeals. 
                  62.15. Off-street parking existing at the effective date of this ordinance in connection with the operation of an existing building or use shall not be reduced to an amount less than hereinafter required for a similar new building or use. 
                  62.2. Parking space requirements for all districts. Off-street automobile storage or parking space shall be provided with vehicular access to a street or alley, and shall be equal in or to at least the minimum requirements for the specific land use set forth. 

                   
                  62.3. Site requirements. All off-street parking, except that for one-family and two-family dwellings, shall be laid out, constructed, and maintained in accordance with the following requirements: 
                  62.31. All such parking areas shall be hard surfaces with concrete or plant bituminous material and shall be maintained in a dustproof condition and that a good stand of grass be maintained on the remainder of the lot. 
                  62.32. Lighting facilities shall be so arranged that light is reflected away from adjacent properties. 
                  62.33. The parking lot shall be adequately drained. 
                  62.34. Along those lot lines of the parking area which abut residential districts, a dense planting of trees and shrubs shall be established on a strip of land not less than eight feet in width adjacent to the districts and provided that such planting be not less than six feet in height and a substantial bumper rail of wood, metal or concrete shall be installed on the inside of the planting strip. 
                  62.35. A raised curb of at least six inches shall be erected along all of the property lines, except for driveway openings, and those lot lines abutting residential districts where the requirements in section 62.34 shall prevail. 
                  62.36. No sign, whether permanent or temporary, shall be placed within the public right-of-way. Signs and planting strips shall be arranged so that they do not obstruct visibility for drivers or pedestrians. 
                  62.37. No off-street parking space or driveway shall be constructed so as to require exiting vehicles to back into the right-of-way of a public street. 
                  62.38. For parking areas with 100 or more parking spaces, at least ten percent of the parking area shall be permanently landscaped, excluding buffers as required in [section] 62.34. Landscaping may consist of trees, shrubs, flowers, or other ornamental plants, provided that all landscaped areas are regularly maintained by the lot owner and that any dead or dying trees or plants are replaced within one month of death or noticeable decay. Furthermore, all landscaped areas shall be integrated into the parking lot design and not relegated exclusively to one concentrated location or to the edges of the parking area. 
                  Section 63. - Off-street loading and unloading space. 
                  Off-street loading and unloading spaces shall be provided as hereinafter required by this ordinance. 
                  63.1. Size of off-street loading spaces. Each off-street loading space shall have minimum dimensions of 14 feet in height, 12 feet in width, and 55 feet in length. However, upon sufficient demonstration that a particular loading space will be used exclusively by shorter trucks, the board of zoning appeals may reduce the minimum length accordingly to as little as 35 feet. 
                  63.2. Connection to street or alley. Each required off-street loading space shall have direct access to a street or alley or have a driveway which offers satisfactory ingress and egress for trucks. 
                  63.3. Floor area over 10,000 square feet. There shall be provided for each hospital, institution, hotel, commercial, or industrial building or similar use requiring the receipt or distribution of materials or merchandise, and having a floor area of more than 10,000 square feet, at least one off-street loading space for each 10,000 square feet of floor space or fraction thereof. Such space shall be so located as not to hinder the free movement of pedestrians and vehicles over a sidewalk, street or alley. 
                  63.4. Floor area less than 10,000 square feet. There shall be provided for each commercial or industrial building requiring the receipt or distribution of materials or merchandise and having a floor area of less than 10,000 square feet, sufficient off-street loading space (not necessarily a full space if shared by an adjacent establishment) so located as not to hinder the free movement of pedestrians and vehicles over a sidewalk, street or alley. 
                  63.5. Bus and trucking terminals. There shall be provided sufficient space to accommodate the maximum number of buses or trucks to be stored or to be loaded at the terminal at any one time. 
                  63.6. Location of off-street loading spaces. All required off-street loading spaces shall be located on the same lot as the building which they are intended to serve, or on an adjacent lot when shared with the use occupying said adjacent lot. 
                  63.7. Emergency vehicle access areas. The planning commission or board of zoning appeals may require such separate designated service areas in appropriate locations as deemed necessary to provide access for emergency vehicles. Where required, emergency service 
                  areas shall be located as close as practicable to the main entrances of the principal structures on the property, shall satisfy the off-street loading space dimensional requirements in [section] 63.1, and shall be visibly designated for exclusive emergency use, either by painting, appropriate signage or both. 
                  63.8. Permanent reservation.

                  Section 84. - Buffer and Landscape Standards for Gateway Overlay Zoning District. 
                  This section enacts a new article to provide guidance in the management of development along the major highways entering the City of Gray, which are U.S. Route 129, Georgia Route 22, Georgia Route 11, and Georgia Route 18; and shall apply to all properties bordering these highway corridors. These are the major highways through the City of Gray, which are traveled daily by many people and are home to numerous businesses and residents, thus making these highway corridors the major gateways to the City of Gray with much value to the community, both economically and aesthetically. 
                  The purpose of this section is to set standards for development of property fronting these highway corridors, including the establishment of buffers and the preservation and establishment of landscaping and trees as a part of all land disturbing activities in order to safeguard the ecological and aesthetic environment necessary for the health, safety, and welfare of the public, to enhance and protect property values, and to make the City of Gray a more attractive place to live, visit, and conduct business. 
                  Buffer areas visibly separate one use from another through screening and distance; shield and block noise, light, glare or visual or other conditions; block physical passage to non-similar areas; and reduce air pollution, dust, dirt, and litter. 
                  Trees, woodland areas, and landscape strips act as buffers against noise, wind and sun; filter out pollutants; assist in stabilizing the soil; reduce erosion and storm water runoff; improve water quality; enhance wildlife; and increase the aesthetic, social, and property value of the community. 
                  Thus, the mayor and city council of the City of Gray hereby finds that requirements for buffers, the planting of new trees and other landscape material, the protection and preservation of trees as part of the land development process along the Gateway Highways U.S. Route 129, Georgia Route 22, Georgia Route 11, and Georgia Route 18, are public purposes and provide for the public health and general welfare.

                  f.  Upon application for a special exception as provided for in sections 114 and 115, the width of buffers as required in Table 1 may be reduced by no more than 50 percent, as appropriate, by the mayor and city council, if and only if it is clearly demonstrated that existing topography, non-vegetative materials and/or vegetation within the reduced area achieve the purpose and intent of this article. 
                  g.  Modifications to frontage strip can only be done with the approval of the zoning enforcement officer. If it is clearly demonstrated that valid topographic reasons require grading which will damage existing mature trees in the frontage strip, re-landscaping in accordance with requirements contained in section 84 may be allowed. 
                  h.  If the amount of the buffer required in section 84.41 Table 1 is larger than ten percent of the total lot area, the zoning enforcement officer shall authorize a reduction in the required buffer size to five percent of the total lot area. The buffer shall maintain a uniform depth along the property line(s) to be buffered. 
                  i.  Uses that are allowed in multiple districts may conform to the least restrictive landscaping requirements for any district in which the use is permitted and shall not be based on zoning of the lot. This exception shall not apply to two family dwellings (duplex), multi family dwellings (apartments, townhouses, zero lot line homes) or similar uses. 
                  84.7. Grandfathered projects. 
                  a.  This article shall not apply to any portion of a property included within the limits of a valid permitted project issued prior to the effective date of this ordinance, provided that all time constraints relating to the permit issued shall be observed. In no event shall any grandfathered project be extended for a greater time period than 12 months. 
                  b.  The buffer requirements shall not apply to any existing development unless the zoning of the property is changed or there is a major change in the intensity of the existing use on that lot. 
                  84.8. Berms. 
                  a.  Berms used as a frontage strip or landscape strip shall conform to the following:

                  84.11. Tree protection. 
                  a.  Planning considerations. Tree space is the most critical factor in tree protection throughout the development process. The root systems of trees do extend beyond the drip line of the canopy. The root system within the drip line region is generally considered to be the critical root zone. Disturbance within this root zone will directly affect a tree's chances for survival. To protect these trees critical root zones the following standards shall apply: 
                  1.  The use of tree save islands and stands is encouraged. This will facilitate ease in overall site organization as related to tree protection. 
                  2.  Tree protection zones for stands or single trees should include an area no less than the total area beneath the tree(s) canopy as defined by the farthest canopy drip line of that tree(s). 
                  3.  Layout of the project site utility and grading plans should accommodate the required tree protective zones. Utilities must be placed along corridors between protective zones. 
                  4.  Construction site activities such as parking, materials storage, concrete washout, burnhole placement, etc., shall be arranged so as to prevent disturbances within tree protection zones. 
                  5.  No disturbances shall occur within the protective zone of stands of trees during construction. 
                  b.  Protective barriers. Protective tree barriers shall be installed along the outer edge of and completely surrounding the critical root zones of all designated tree protective zones prior to any land disturbances. 
                  1.  These barriers will be a minimum of four feet high constructed in a post and rail configuration. Four foot orange polyethylene laminar safety fencing is also acceptable. 
                  2.  Passive forms of tree protection may be utilized to delineate tree save areas which are remote from areas of land disturbance. These areas must be completely surrounded with continuous rope or flagging. 
                  3.  All tree protection zones should be designated as such with "tree save area" sign posted visibly on all sides of the fenced area. These signs are intended to inform subcontractors of the tree protection process. Signs requesting subcontractor cooperation and compliance with tree protection standards are highly recommended for site entrances. 
                  4.  All designated tree protection zones must be protected from the sedimentation of erosion material. Type A, B or C Silt screening as defined in the Manual for Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Georgia shall be installed when necessary along the outer uphill edge of the tree protection zone at the land disturbance interface, and shall remain in place throughout the construction and landscape installation process. 
                  c.  Encroachment. Most trees can tolerate only a small percentage of critical root zone loss. If encroachment is anticipated within the critical root zones of designated tree protective zones the following preventive measures shall be employed. 
                  1.  Where soil compaction might occur due to traffic or material storage the tree protective zone must first be mulched and maintained with a minimum four inch layer of processed pine bark or wood chips or a six inch layer of pine straw. 
                  2.  The installation of utilities through a protective zone shall occur by way of tunneling rather than trenching. If roots must be cut, proper root pruning procedures must be employed. 
                  3.  No fill shall be allowed within the drip line. 
                  4.  Where the zoning officer has determined that irreparable damage has occurred to trees within the tree protective zones, the trees must be removed and replaced. 
                  d.  Landmark and historic trees. The Georgia Landmark and Historical Tree Register was established in 1994 by the Georgia Urban Forest Council. The register serves as a record of all the significant trees across the state. 
                  Landmark and historic trees are those individual trees or groups of trees that have been designated as significant on the basis of their importance in national state or local history. They possess integrity of location, setting, design, progeny, and represent events, heritage, feeling and association. 
                  Inclusion of a tree or group of trees on the register is used for the protection and preservation of the tree(s). Any tree or group of trees which is included on the Georgia Landmark and Historical Tree Register is prohibited from being damaged and may be removed only with prior zoning department approval. If a historic and/or landmark tree is damaged or removed without prior approval the department of planning and zoning will impose a fine equal to $1,000.00 per inch DBH of the damaged or removed tree(s). 
                  1.  Landmark trees. For a tree or group of trees to be considered Landmark for inclusion by the Georgia Urban Forest Council on The Georgia Landmark and Historical Tree Register at least one of the following criteria must be satisfied: 
                  a.  The tree(s) is/are commonly recognized as an established and familiar feature of the community or as a significant part of the community's heritage; 
                  b.  The tree(s) must have been planted and maintained for educational purposes for more than 75 years; 
                  c.  The tree(s) was/were planted as a memorial to an individual, group event or cause and is confirmed to be more than 75 years old; 
                  d.  The tree(s) symbolize(s) a historically significant individual, place, event or contribution. 
                  2.  Historical trees. For a tree or group of trees to be considered landmark for inclusion by the Georgia Urban Forest council on The Georgia Landmark and Historical Tree Register at least one of the following criteria must be satisfied. 
                  a.  The tree(s) is/are identified with an historically significant individual or group. 
                  b.  The tree(s) is/are located at the site of an historical event and significantly affects one's perception of the event. 
                  c.  The tree(s) date(s) to the time of an historic event at the location of the tree. 
                  d.  The tree(s) is/are confirmed as the progeny of a tree that meets any of the criteria. 
                  3.  Hazard trees. In the event a specimen, historic or landmark tree is determined to be a hazard to property, power lines or people the tree may be removed without recompense or penalty only with prior approval from the zoning enforcement officer.

The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrological vegetation and hydrological conditions involving a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation. 
                  85.4. Groundwater Recharge Area Overlay District. 
                  85.4.1. Findings of fact. Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides, herbicides, sprayed on crops, animal waste and septic tank effluents contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies. 
                  85.4.2. Purpose. The purpose of this overlay district is to establish criteria to protect significant groundwater recharge areas from pollution by spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, application of chemicals, injections and other development pressures. 
                  85.4.3. District delineation. The Groundwater Recharge Area Overlay District is delineated according to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources' "Most Significant Groundwater Recharge Areas of Georgia Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 Edition)." Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium, or low based on the "Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map Atlas 20, 1992 Edition." Said maps are hereby adopted and made a part of this ordinance. 
                  85.4.4. Permitted uses. All uses allowed in the underlying zoning districts are permitted in the Groundwater Recharge Area Protection Overlay District. The following are additional requirements for specific uses: 
                  a.  New aboveground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660 gallons, shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt provided they comply with all federal requirements. 
                  b.  New agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined if they are within:

                  Notes to tables 
                  Section A. The above minimum lot sizes are for the typical size home (3 or 4 bedroom) with basic appurtenances such as: driveway, minimum number of trees and water supply line. If larger homes, swimming pools, tennis courts or outbuildings, etc. are proposed for construction or if trees would interfere with installation of an on-site sewage management system, the Jones County Board of Health will require larger lots to assure usable soil area. 
                  Section B. The Jones County Board of Health may also require larger lot sizes when physical factors indicate the need to do so. These factors include, but are not limited to, the availability of sufficient unobstructed land areas for an approved on-site sewage management system and approved replacement system, slope greater than five percent, percolation rates higher than 45 minutes per inch, need for subsurface drainage or adverse topographic features. 
                  Section C. Lots shall be a minimum width of 100 feet or 150 feet measured within the area where an approved on-site sewage management system and replacement system are to be located when served by a public water supply system or nonpublic water supply system, respectively. 
                  Section D. The following land areas are not considered as a part of a lot when calculating the required minimum lot size: rights-of-way of roads, easements (such as power line or pipe line) that exclude installation of an on-site sewage management system, bodies of water, land within 50 feet of a lake, river, stream, wetland or other bodies of water and similar limiting factors. 
                  Section E. There must be an unobstructed area on each lot for installation of an approved on-site sewage management system and an area equal in size for a conventional system or larger area, as appropriate, for an approved replacement system; this will include sufficient area for necessary site modifications for installation of both the initial system and a replacement system. All pertinent city zoning setbacks and other space requirements must also be met. 
                  Section F. The maximum daily sewage flow for each lot or parcel of land shall not exceed 600 gpad when served by nonpublic or individual water supply system or 1,200 gpad when served by public water supply system. When sewage flows exceed these quantities (600 or 1,200 gpad as indicated) for a given dwelling structure, the minimum lot size or parcel of land shall be increased proportionally. Example: Assume a public water supply exists (so 1,200 gpad maximum sewage flow allowed per minimum required land area of 21,780 square feet), and there is a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd. To determine the square footage of the lot needed, X, use the following formula: 

                   
                  = 4.17 acres 
                  = 4.17 acres × 43,560 ft 2 /acre 
                  = 181,500 ft 2 area of land needed. 
                  Likewise, for a nonpublic (individual) water supply, to determine the square footage of the lot needed, Y, for a proposed sewage flow of 5,000 gpd, use the following formula: 

                   
                  = 8.33 acres 
                  = 8.33 acres × 43,560 ft 2 /acre 
                  = 363,000 ft 2 area of land needed. 
                  85.5. Wetlands Protection Overlay District. 
                  85.5.1. Findings of fact. The wetlands within the City of Gray are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constrains due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; natural resource education; scientific study, and recreational opportunities. 
                  85.5.2. Purpose. The purpose of this overlay district is to promote the wise use of wetlands and protect them from alterations which will significantly affect or reduce the primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic natural areas and wildlife habitat areas. 
                  85.5.3. District delineation. The Wetlands Protection Overlay District is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Gray, Georgia that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife National Wetlands Inventory Maps. This map shall be referred to as the generalized wetlands map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this section, together with all explanatory matter thereon as attached thereto. 
                  The generalized wetlands map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the City of Gray and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this Ordinance does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
                  85.5.4. Wetland development permit requirements. No regulated activity or use except those identified shall be allowed within the Wetland Overlay District without a development permit from the City of Gray. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a Wetlands Protection District boundary as determined by the zoning enforcement officer using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the development permit will not be granted until Section 404 Permit or letter of permission is issued. 
                  85.5.5. Permitted uses. The following uses are permitted by right within the Wetland Protection Overlay District to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, exempted from Section 404 regulations provided they do not have impacts on a navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of an individual 404 Permit. However, under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, a permit may be required in some circumstances.) draining or dredging as provided herein. (These activities listed in this section are: 
                  1.  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission and as specified in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
                  2.  Conservation or preservation soil, water, vegetation, fish or other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of the State of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit. 
                  3.  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing. 
                  4.  The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture. 
                  5.  The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed, and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed. 
                  6.  Education, scientific research and nature trails. 
                  85.5.6. Prohibited uses. The following uses are prohibited in a Wetland Overlay District: 
                  1.  Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants. 
                  2.  Hazardous or sanitary landfills. 
                  Section 86. - HD Historic Overlay Zoning District. 
                  The purpose of this district is to protect areas deemed to possess special historical, cultural, and aesthetic features. Whenever a property or area is designated historic, the HD Historic Overlay Zoning District designation shall be placed upon that specific property or area, in addition to the applicable zoning district designation. The requirements contained herein are in addition to requirements applicable to that underlying zoning district. 
                  86.1. Certificate of appropriateness required. Where a Certificate of Appropriateness is required by the City of Gray Historic Preservation Commission Ordinance for construction, structural alteration, or use of land in an HD District, no person shall undertake that construction, structural alteration; or use without having first obtained a Certificate of Appropriateness. 
                  86.2. Affect on zoning permit process. A Zoning Compliance Permit or Conditional Use Permit shall not be issued for any construction, structural alteration, or use of land in an HD District for which a certificate of appropriateness is required and has not been issued. An application for a conditional use may be considered and approved contingent upon issuance of a certificate of appropriateness. 
                  86.3. Annexed property. Whenever property proposed to be annexed into the City of Gray is designated as being in a Jones County HD Historic Overlay Zoning District, the applicant shall be required to request said property be included in the City of Gray HD Historic Overlay Zoning District. 
                  (Ord. of 9-10-2001; Ord. No. 06-O-002, 3-6-2006) 
                  Section 87. - Design overlay districts. 
                  87.1. Purpose and intent. The Downtown Design Overlay District (DDO) and Corridor Design Overlay District (CDO) have been implemented to help create a sense of place for the City of Gray that will help to protect and enhance the downtown area. The development in the DDO district affects Gray's small town character, its traditional development pattern, and its cultural heritage and tourism economy. 
                  Often, conventional development patterns produce linear development, asphalt wastelands, harsh and glaring light levels, and a proliferation of billboards and other distracting signage and visual clutter. Inadequately planned and regulated strip development has also spawned traffic congestion, competing signage and incompatible architecture. The primary goal of the overlay zoning ordinance and the Design Guideline Manual is to protect and improve the character of these gateways and corridors while directing future development that promotes safety, walkability, visual attractiveness and directional wayfinding in a manner that compliments Gray's ambiance and historic character and orientation. 
                  87.2. Objectives. The properties within the Downtown Design Overlay District (DDO) are primarily one-story commercial buildings, with one and two-story residential homes primarily located around the perimeter of the district. The properties within the Corridor Design Overlay District (CDO) are primarily one-story commercial buildings. The overall purpose and intent of both districts is to permit the development of land in a manner consistent with a traditional, pedestrian-oriented, small town feel. The regulations for both the Downtown Design Overlay District (DDO) and Corridor Design Overlay District (CDO) are intended to implement the following objectives: 
                  87.2.1. Promote redevelopment. To provide for and promote the rehabilitation, revitalization and redevelopment of vacant and underutilized properties in the districts. 
                  87.2.2. Promote development of vacant parcels, in keeping with the vision of the corridor. To provide for and promote the development of vacant properties within the districts in a manner and style consistent with the regulations set forth in the City of Gray Design Guideline Manual 
                  87.2.3. Improve streetscapes. To implement various recommendations in plan, programs, studies, and strategies of the city, for aesthetic improvement of the overlay districts. In order to improve the streetscape, additional provisions for private property improvements are required. 
                  87.2.4. Promote specific designs. To encourage development and redevelopment to occur in a manner consistent with the community's expectations for superior design and development characteristics that promote quality of place. Such expectations include: 
                  •  Human-scale development and pedestrian-friendly places, including generally the principles of neo-traditional development. 
                  •  Development that is sensitive to and that extends design principles characteristic of the city's historic characteristics. 
                  •  New non-residential development using design principles consistent with the late 19th and early 20th century architectural style, in order to recreate the original small town feel of the commercial business district by using "commercial block" patterns with common sidewalls, building fronts abutting the sidewalk and on-street parking. 
                  •  Breaking up "super-blocks" (large parcel development patterns) and optimizing connectivity. 
                  •  Installing small public gathering places and pocket parks in redeveloped areas. 
                  •  Ensuring quality construction that will avoid construction of buildings with limited life spans. 
                  87.3. Establishment of districts. The following overlay zoning districts are hereby established: 

                   
                  87.3.1. The Downtown Design Overlay District (DDO) regulations shall only apply to those parcels as shown on the official zoning map for the City of Gray. 
                  87.3.2. The Corridor Design Overlay District (CDO) regulations shall not apply to single-family dwellings. The CDO regulations shall apply to all non-residentially used or zoned parcels contiguous to the right-of-way of the following corridors within the Gray city limits as of the date of ordinance adoption, but shall not extend beyond 500 feet of each side of the corridors. If any part of the parcel is within the 500-foot buffer, then the entire parcel must conform. The corridors are defined as follows: 
                  •  Gray Highway/US 129/Highway 11. 
                  •  Monticello Highway/Highway 11.

                  87.4. Relationship to underlying zoning regulations. The existing zoning map and underlying zoning regulations governing all properties within the Downtown Design Overlay District (DDO) and Corridor Design Overlay District (CDO) shall remain in full force and effect. The special regulations contained within this chapter shall be overlaid upon, and shall be imposed in addition to the requirements of the zoning district within which a specific property is located. Except where it is otherwise explicitly provided, whenever the overlay district standards conflict with standards that would otherwise apply under this zoning ordinance, the most restrictive regulations shall control. 
                  •  Within the Corridor Design Overlay District (CDO), property zoned R-1 (Single-Family Residential), R1A and R-2 and recognized as a lot of record at the time of adoption of the legislation are exempted. Individual single-family parcels not subject to the provisions of the site regulations are not controlled by the regulations of this overlay district ordinance. 
                  87.5. Use limitations. 
                  •  Permitted uses. Except for mobile buildings, trailers and manufactured homes, which are prohibited, all uses that are permitted in the underlying zoning district(s) shall be permitted in the Downtown Design Overlay District (DDO) and Corridor Design Overlay District (CDO). 
                  •  Amortization of nonconforming uses. When a nonconforming use is abandoned or discontinued for a period of 90 consecutive days, any subsequent use of the property thereafter must comply with the applicable regulations of the Gray Zoning Ordinance regarding the use of the property. 
                  87.6. Conformance with design guidelines. Development and construction activity within the Downtown Design Overlay District (DDO) and Corridor Design Overlay District (CDO) must conform to the adopted City of Gray Design Guidelines Manual. Prior to issuing an occupational tax certificate for the relocation of an existing business OR for the establishment of a new business, the city clerk will require the applicant to provide written proof of zoning compliance. 
                  87.7. Applicability. 
                  87.7.1. All further development of the property in the DDO and CDO shall conform to the standards and guidelines adopted for the Districts, regardless of any change in ownership. 
                  87.7.2. The violation of any provisions of the DDO and CDO standards and guidelines, as submitted and approved under the provisions herein, shall constitute a violation of these regulations. 
                  87.7.3. Any application for rezoning to a DDO or CDO classification shall be submitted in accordance with the City of Gray's rezoning requirements. 
                  87.7.4. To ensure that development and redevelopment within the DDO and CDO areas are consistent with the objectives of this section, each project is required to undergo a project review prior to the issuance of building permits by the City of Gray. The review requirements are outlined below in section 87.9. 
                  87.8. Definitions. 
                  •  Aggrieved party: One who demonstrates that his or her property will suffer special damage as a result of the decision complained of, rather than merely some damage that is common to all property owners and citizens similarly situated. 
                  •  Certificate of design review (certificate): A document, required prior to a building permit, approving an application to make an alteration or a material change in the appearance of a property or of a structure, site, or work-of-art located in the Downtown Design Overlay District (DDO) or Corridor Design Overlay District (CDO). 
                  •  Connectivity: Development achieves "connectivity" when one or more land uses and parcels within the development have direct accommodations for both vehicles and/or pedestrians to travel between or among those land uses, and direct vehicular and pedestrian connections with compatible land uses on abutting properties. Direct accommodations for vehicles means that there is one or more alley, road, or driveway connections between the uses on the development site and among compatible uses on abutting sites (parcels), so that a vehicle can exit one development and enter the other development (i.e. cross property lines) without exiting onto a public street that provides principal access to the developments. Direct accommodations for pedestrians means that there are one or more sidewalks or other approved paths that allow a pedestrian to go from one development or parcel to another without using the sidewalk along a public street that provides principal access to the developments. 
                  •  District: The area identified on the official zoning map of the City of Gray. 
                  •  Design review commission: Reviews the architectural and site planning considerations and improvements proposed within the DDO and CDO. 
                  •  Exterior architectural feature: The architectural style, general design, and general arrangement of the exterior of a structure, including, but not limited to, the texture of the building material, the type and style of all windows, doors, and signs, and other related architectural fixtures, features, details, or elements. 
                  •  Material change in appearance: The construction of a new structure, or a change that will affect the exterior architectural features of any structure, site, or work-of-art within the DDO or CDO districts. Material change in appearance includes without limitation any one or more of the following: 
                  •  A reconstruction or alteration of the size, shape, or facade of a structure, including without limitation, relocation or replacement of any doors or windows, or removal or alteration of any architectural features, details, or elements; 
                  •  Demolition of a structure; 
                  •  Relocation of a structure within the DDO or CDO district or from a location outside the DDO or CDO district to a location within the DDO or CDO district; 
                  •  Commencement of excavation, grading or site improvement; 
                  •  A change in the location of advertising visible from the public way on the property; or 
                  •  The erection, alteration, restoration, or removal of any structure within the DDO or CDO district, including walls, fences, steps, and pavements, or other related features. 
                  •  Ordinary repair and maintenance: Work done to prevent deterioration or to replace parts of a building, structure, sign or exterior architectural feature with equivalent materials in order to correct any deterioration, decay of or damage to any such building, structure, sign or exterior architectural feature. Ordinary maintenance or repair work may not exceed 25 percent of the structure's assessed value in any 24 consecutive month period. 
                  •  Pedestrian-friendly: A term which refers to development and features of developments that are designed with an emphasis primarily on the street sidewalk and on pedestrian access to the site and building, rather than an exclusive focus on auto access and parking. Buildings are generally placed close to a street, and the main entrance is oriented to a street or sidewalk. Building facades and other development features along a street are oriented and scaled to the pedestrian. 
                  •  Zoning enforcement officer: The local official designated by the City of Gray as the officer responsible for enforcing and administering the requirements of this ordinance. 
                  87.9. Design review commission. 
                  87.9.1. Jurisdiction. The design review commission created by this Section shall have jurisdiction within the city limits of the City of Gray, except where the historic preservation commission has jurisdiction pursuant to a historic preservation ordinance. 
                  87.9.2. Establishment of design review commission. A design review commission (DRC) is hereby established. The DRC shall consist of five voting members, each of whom shall serve a term of four years without compensation, with initial terms being staggered. 
                  (i)  Each member must be a resident, a business owner, or a property owner within the city and be qualified based on demonstrated interest or experience in design, urban design, architecture, historic preservation, architectural history, planning, landscape design, development, real estate or related fields. At least one (1) member of the Design Review Commission shall be a member of the Downtown Development Authority. 
                  (ii)  When any vacancy occurs on the commission or when any commission member's four-year term expires, the procedure set forth in section 87.9.3 below will be followed:

                  3)  Chairman of Main Street Gray; 
                  4)  Majority of DDA for the one member that is from DDA. 
                  (ii)  After the ten-day nomination period has expired, the city clerk will compile the list of nominees and submit the list to city council for a vote at the next regularly scheduled city council meeting. The list of nominees will specify the name of the person(s) who nominated each candidate and will verify that each candidate has consented in writing to serve. The majority vote of city council will determine the membership of the commission. 
                  87.9.4. Removal of commission member. 
                  (i)  Removal will occur automatically if a commission member:

                  3)  Dies. 
                  (ii)  A commission member may be removed for cause by a majority vote of city council. "For Cause" will include, but not be limited to: 
                  1)  Chronic failure to attend four or more meetings except due to illness or family illness. 
                  2)  Refusal to vote at four or more meetings. 
                  87.9.5. Meetings. The design review commission shall adopt rules of procedure as are necessary to carry out the purposes of its authority. The commission shall establish a regular monthly meeting date and time for its meetings. However, meetings shall be held only on an as-needed basis. All meetings shall be open to the public. The commission shall appoint a secretary to keep a record and minutes of its proceedings, showing the action of each commission member upon each question. The commission shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be filed with the city clerk and which shall be public records. The zoning enforcement officer shall serve as advisor to the commission. 
                  87.9.6. Authority. The design review commission is authorized to receive, consider, grant, grant with conditions, or deny applications for design review as required by this ordinance. In granting approval of design review, the commission may impose such requirements and conditions with respect to the location, construction, maintenance and operation of any use or building, in addition to those expressly set forth herein, as may be deemed necessary for the protection of adjacent properties and the public interest. Decisions of the design review commission shall be final unless a written appeal to the mayor and city council is filed with the city clerk no later than 30 days after the date of the design review commission's decision. 
                  87.9.7. Required design review/certificate of design review. Within the DDO and CDO, no material change in appearance shall be made and no building permit issued unless a certificate of design review (certificate) has been approved by the design review commission. Such material changes shall conform to all of the requirements as specified in the City of Gray Design Guideline Manual. Work not in compliance with a certificate of design review is prohibited. 
                  87.9.8. Exemption for minor changes. There are certain types of routine maintenance activities that property owners can carry out without obtaining a certificate of design review. These activities are fairly narrow in scope, however, and depending on the extent of the maintenance effort, could require design review. The City of Gray Design Guidelines Manual should be consulted for additional information about routine maintenance items that do not require a certificate. 
                  87.9.9. Certificate of design review application requirements and process. All applications for design review approval shall be made as required by the zoning enforcement officer and shall, at minimum, contain the following information: 
                  (i)  Elevation drawings; color and material samples. Every application or review involving the construction of a new building or structure and alterations and/or additions to existing structures shall be accompanied by exterior elevation drawings drawn to scale and submitted in sufficient number of copies as required by the zoning enforcement officer. Said exterior elevation drawings shall clearly show, in sufficient detail the exterior appearance and architectural design of proposed change(s) to buildings or structures and new construction, as applicable. Each application shall also indicate proposed materials, textures and colors and provide samples of materials and colors. However, any "ordinary repair or maintenance" as previously defined in this document will not require such a certificate. 
                  (ii)  Photographs. All applications shall be accompanied by photographs of all sides of the existing building(s) or structure(s) affected, and of adjoining properties. Photographs shall be submitted in printed copy unless otherwise specified by the zoning enforcement officer. 
                  (iii)  Site plan and landscaping plan. For every application, a plot plan or site plan drawn to scale shall be submitted which shows all improvements affecting appearances, such as walls, walks, terraces, plantings, tree protection areas, accessory buildings, signs, lights, and other elements. 
                  (iv)  Fee. A fee, as may be established by the mayor and city council, shall be submitted with each application. 
                  (v)  Additional information. Any additional information, as may reasonably be required by the zoning enforcement officer, shall be submitted with the application. 
                  87.9.10. All certificate of design review applications shall be submitted to the zoning enforcement officer at least ten days prior to the DRC's next regularly scheduled meeting. The zoning enforcement officer's written finding of completeness shall be required prior to processing the application. 
                  87.9.11. For new developments, new buildings, and significant changes to existing developments and/or buildings, at least ten days before the next scheduled DRC meeting, an applicant may request from the zoning enforcement officer ("ZEO") a preliminary review by the DRC of the applicant's application or plans. Upon notification by the ZEO of the request for a preliminary review, the DRC will add the request to the agenda for its next meeting. The only purpose of a preliminary review is to assist the applicant in completing the application but in no event will result in a final approval or denial of the application. The completed application shall be submitted to the ZEO at least ten days prior to the DRC's next regularly scheduled meeting. The DRC shall review the application and make a final decision on the application at its next scheduled meeting. 
                  87.10. Decisions on applications for certificates of design review. The design review commission shall utilize the City of Gray Design Guideline Manual in evaluating all proposed projects requesting a certificate of design review. 
                  87.10.1. Standards for certificate of design review decisions. The DRC shall issue a certificate of design review if it finds the proposed change(s) in appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the DDO and CDO districts. 
                  The design review commission shall consider the appropriateness of any proposed material change in appearance in the context of the following criteria: 
                  •  Consistency with the City of Gray Design Guideline Manual for the type of development and/or the proposed use. 
                  •  The nature and character of the surrounding areas, and the consistency and compatibility of the proposed application with such nature and character. 
                  •  The general design; the character and appropriateness of design, scale of buildings, arrangement, materials, texture and colors (non-painted surfaces), of the structure in question; and the relation of such elements to similar features of structures in the immediate surrounding area; site and landscaping. 
                  •  The interior arrangement or use having no effect on exterior architectural features, safety or utility, shall not be considered. 
                  •  Among other grounds for considering a design inappropriate are the following defects: character foreign to the area; arresting or spectacular effects; a multiplicity or incongruity of details resulting in a restless and disturbing appearance; and the absence of unity and coherence in composition not in harmony with the density and character of the present structure(s) or surrounding area. 
                  87.10.2. Approval. If an application is approved, the DRC will issue a certificate of design review to the applicant for the proposed work on the property. The DRC has the responsibility to follow up with the applicant after the work has been completed to ensure compliance with the certificate of design review. 
                  87.10.3. Denial. The DRC shall deny a certificate of design Review if it finds the material change in appearance would have a substantial adverse effect on the DDO or CDO district. If an application is denied, the DRC will notify the applicant in writing of its decision and state the reason(s) for the denial. The DRC may suggest modifications or alternatives to the proposed alternation or new construction. Applicants are strongly encouraged to meet with the DRC to discuss modifications which would make the project acceptable. The applicant may make modifications to the plans and resubmit a new or revised application for consideration by the DRC. The denial by the DRC shall be binding upon the zoning enforcement officer, and no building permit shall be issued. 
                  87.10.4. Time limit for approval or denial. The DRC shall approve or deny an application for a certificate of design review within 30 days after a fully completed application is filed with the Zoning Enforcement Officer. Failure of the Commission to act within 45 days shall be deemed an approval of the application and no other evidence of approval by the DRC shall be needed. 
                  87.10.5. Requirement of conformance with certificate of design review. All changes to existing buildings and proposed new construction shall conform to the certificate of design review issued for the project. In the event work is not performed in accordance with such certificate, the DRC shall notify the zoning enforcement officer to issue a stop work order. 
                  87.10.6. Certificate of design review void if construction not commenced. An approved certificate of design review shall be valid for 18 months, after which time it shall expire. Upon expiration, a new application must be submitted and a new certificate of design review issued by the design review commission prior to commencement of any construction or building modifications. 
                  87.10.7. Appeals. Any person adversely affected by any determination made by the DRC relative to the issuance or denial of a certificate of design review may appeal such determination to the City Council of Gray. The appeal must clearly set forth all alleged errors, and must be filed with the zoning enforcement officer's office within 30 days after the date of the DRC's decision. After a public hearing by the mayor and city council, the council may either approve the decision, modify the decision, or reject the decision, if it finds that the DRC abused its discretion by acting arbitrarily and/or in violation of constitutional rights in reaching its decision. 
                  87.11. Amendments. Amendments to the DDO and CDO Districts will follow the same process as initial adoption. Any proposed amendments to the overlay boundary or individual properties must be publicly advertised and reviewed through established public hearing procedures of the comprehensive land development ordinance. 
                  87.12. Severability. All ordinances and parts of ordinances in conflict herewith are repealed to the extent necessary to give this ordinance full force and effect except that any ordinances repealed by this provision shall not limit or impair the City of Gray's authority to enforce such ordinances or resolutions to the extent that violations thereof occurred prior to repeal.

                  ARTICLE IX. - SPECIAL PROVISIONS 

                  Section 89. - Manufactured (mobile) homes and manufactured home parks. 
                  The following regulations shall apply to all manufactured (mobile) homes. See section 91.2 for mobile [manufactured] home parks. 
                  89.1. Classification of manufactured homes. All manufactured homes are hereby placed into one of the following classifications: 
                  89.11. Type A manufactured homes are manufactured or mobile homes that meet or exceed the construction standards promulgated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development that were in effect at the time of construction and satisfy each of the following additional criteria: 
                  (1)  The home has a width at its narrowest point, when placed on site, of at least 18 feet. 
                  (2)  The pitch of the home's roof has a minimum vertical rise of three feet for each 12 feet of horizontal run, and the roof is finished with a type of shingle that is commonly used in residential construction.

                  89.12. Type B manufactured homes are manufactured or mobile homes that meet or exceed the construction standards promulgated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development that were in effect at the time of construction, but that do not satisfy the criteria necessary to qualify the home as a type A manufactured home. 
                  89.13. Type C manufactured homes are manufactured homes that do not meet the definitional criteria of a type A or type B manufactured home. 
                  (Ord. No. 11-O-001, 1-3-2011) 
                  Section 90. - Cluster development. 
                  90.1. Purpose. The purpose of cluster development is to provide an option to traditional subdivision design that will: 
                  (a)  Result in improved living environments; 
                  (b)  Promote more economic and functional subdivision design; 
                  (c)  Preserve open space and sensitive natural areas; 
                  (d)  Encourage ingenuity and originality in subdivision design; 
                  (e)  Encourage a pleasing mix of dwelling unit types and living arrangements within a single development; 
                  (f)  Encourage the development of improved recreational facilities in residential developments; 
                  (g)  Reduce the cost of infrastructure needed to serve new developments; and 
                  (h)  Preserve and enhance the character of established residential neighborhoods. 
                  To achieve these objectives, an applicant for a permit to construct a residential development within the R-1, R-1A, and R-2 residential zones may elect, with the written consent of the planning commission, to submit a subdivision plan utilizing the cluster development option, subject to the provisions set forth in this section. The planning commission may permit, upon determination that the proposed development complies with all requirements of this section, variations in lot area, setbacks, and other dimensional requirements, and a variety of residential building types as necessary to ensure that the cluster development design will achieve the objectives identified above. 
                  90.2. Procedures. The procedures and submission requirements for approval of a cluster development shall be the same as those for a standard subdivision as specified in article XII of this ordinance, except as specified below. 
                  90.2.1. Prior to submission of an application for subdivision approval, the applicant shall request written consent to prepare a subdivision plat using the cluster development option from the planning commission at a regular or special meeting. Such request must be submitted to the zoning enforcement officer at least ten days prior to a regularly scheduled planning commission meeting. The planning commission shall act on the request on or before the second regularly scheduled meeting following the date of submission, unless the request includes a conceptual plan review as specified in section 90.2.3. When conceptual plan review is requested or required, the planning commission shall act on the letter of consent request within 45 days of the meeting at which the planning commission receives the request. 
                  90.2.2. The planning commission's letter of consent shall, at a minimum, reiterate the objectives of the cluster development option and refer the applicant to the specific section of the land development ordinance containing the required standards for cluster development. A letter of consent shall not constitute nor imply planning commission approval of the development plan. 
                  90.2.3. The prospective applicant also may submit with the written cluster development option request a conceptual plan of the proposed development in order to receive feedback from the planning commission that will help the applicant prepare a preliminary plat. No formal application form or charge shall be required for conceptual plan review. Any recommendations resulting from this review shall be included in the letter of consent. This conceptual plan review procedure shall supersede the preapplication review provisions in section 122 with respect to cluster developments only. 
                  90.2.4. All applicants intending to request a density bonus in accordance with section 90.3.2 below shall submit a conceptual plan for planning commission review. No applicant may request a density bonus from the city council without first obtaining a recommendation to do so from the planning commission. Where the planning commission determines that a density bonus is appropriate to the proposed development plan, such recommendation shall be included in the letter of consent. 
                  90.2.5. An applicant may request that a portion or portions of the proposed development site be rezoned to any zoning district within which the cluster development option is permitted. Any request for a rezoning of a cluster development site shall be processed in the customary manner once the applicant has received written consent from the council to prepare a subdivision plat utilizing the cluster development option. If the rezoning is approved by the city council and the development final plat is subsequently approved by the council, the applicant must commence construction within one year of the date of final plat approval or the mayor and council may initiate action to rezone the property. An applicant may demonstrate that construction has commenced by completing at least 50 percent of all grading and site preparation work in compliance with the approved final plat. 
                  90.3. General requirements. All cluster developments shall comply with the following requirements: 
                  90.3.1. Development density. The total number of units allowed in a cluster development shall be ten percent more than the number allowed on the property by the standard minimum lot size for the applicable zoning district, except as provided in section 90.3.2 of this ordinance. All units built in a cluster development shall be served by public sewer. An increase in development densities on a portion or portions of the property may be allowed through a reduction in required lot sizes, as long as at least ten percent of the development site is preserved as common open space in satisfaction of all requirements specified in section 90.3.5 of this ordinance. 
                  To calculate the number of dwelling units/lots that may be created within a cluster development, multiply the total number of acres in the proposed development site by the factor for the desired type of dwelling and applicable zoning district listed in the following table. The resulting dwelling unit total must be rounded to the nearest whole number. 

                   
                  90.3.2. Density bonus. An applicant, having received written consent from the planning commission to prepare a preliminary plat using the cluster development option, also may request written approval from the city council for an increase in permissible development density of not more than ten percent. City council approval of the requested density bonus must be received prior to the submission of a preliminary plat as required in section 123 of this ordinance. The city council may approve a density bonus, if the proposed cluster development will result in substantial recreational improvements to the developable portions of the common open space or in the provision of improved sidewalks within public rights-of-way in the development. Substantial recreational improvements may include, but not be limited to: 
                  (a)  Jogging/walking trails with exercise stations, benches, and landscaping where appropriate; 
                  (b)  Ballfields, tennis courts, or basketball courts; 
                  (c)  Landscaped picnic areas with barbecue pits, picnic tables, and, if appropriate, shelters; 
                  (d)  A swimming pool with protective fences; 
                  (e)  A clubhouse or other common indoor activity center; or 
                  (f)  Sidewalks within street rights-of-way in compliance with the requirements of section 147. 
                  Any proposed open space improvements or park shall include provisions for regular maintenance as specified in section 90.3.13, unless the applicant has received approval from the city council to dedicate the proposed recreational area to the City of Gray. 
                  In determining the amount of density bonus to be extended for the optional improvements specified above, the city council may consider: 
                  (a)  The market population (age and socioeconomic structure) of the proposed development and the extent to which the proposed improvements will satisfy the recreational needs of that population; 
                  (b)  The size (number of units) of the proposed development and its distance from existing public recreational facilities; 
                  (c)  The extent to which the proposed improvements will lessen any potential impacts to neighboring developments or make the development more compatible with the surrounding area; 
                  (d)  The estimated cost of the proposed open space improvements and the extent to which the benefits to the applicant resulting from a density bonus will compensate for the cost of the improvements; and 
                  (e)  The extent to which the proposed improvements will further the stated goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan. 
                  90.3.3. Minimum size of cluster developments. To be proposed as a cluster development, the subdivision site must contain at least ten contiguous acres of land area, unless the proposed development is determined by the planning commission to be a logical extension of an existing or approved development and will be designed to be compatible with said adjoining development. Such a determination shall be included in the planning commission's letter of consent. 
                  90.3.4. Types of dwellings. A cluster development may consist of a mix of any residential dwelling unit types permitted within the applicable zoning district, except for multifamily buildings. 
                  90.3.5. Open space and parks. Every cluster development shall contain open spaces equal to at least ten percent of the total area of the cluster development. All open space shall be integrated into the development design such that it enhances the privacy and convenience of individual homes within the development. Open space areas should be designed to maximize access from individual properties within the development. In addition, open space areas also shall comply with the following specific requirements: 
                  90.3.5.1. At no point shall an open space area be less than 20 feet in width. 
                  90.3.5.2. At least 50 percent of the lands designated as open space shall consist of developable land area with slopes not exceeding eight percent. However, where the applicant has proposed to improve portions of the open space as a park, the planning commission may allow certain floodplain areas or slopes in excess of eight percent to be considered part of the 50 percent developable land area requirement, when such inclusion would not conflict with the proposed recreational uses or endanger the public. 
                  90.3.5.3. Parks and/or recreational improvements (except for sidewalk improvements) may be proposed only in open space areas that are designated as developable land area by the planning commission. Only open space uses may be proposed within areas that do not qualify as developable land area. 
                  90.3.5.4. Common open space shall not include public or private road rights-of-way, driveways, private yards or patios, parking areas, utility easements containing above ground utilities (where such facilities would interfere with the intended uses of the open space), nor other areas designed for nonrecreational or non-open space uses. 
                  90.3.5.5. Where unique or special natural features exist on the development site, such resources should be included within the designated open space area. If the planning commission determines that any unique or special natural features represent significant local resources, the applicant may be required to include them within the designated open space areas. 
                  90.3.5.6. Where an applicant proposes to construct a park within a cluster development, the planning commission may lessen requirements for individual property access to create sufficient open space mass to accommodate the proposed recreational improvements, as long as adequate public access is provided for the residents of the development. 
                  90.3.5.7. All proposed recreational improvements to open space areas shall be designed to afford equal access to physically disabled persons. 
                  90.3.5.8. No parks or improved recreational areas shall be located along the boundary of the development, where said boundary adjoins an established residential area, unless the proposed cluster development is determined by the planning commission to be an extension of the neighboring residential area. A proposed park may be located along any property boundary of the development site that borders a road, stream, or nonresidential use. 
                  90.3.6. Buffers. All cluster developments should be designed to enhance surrounding neighborhoods and minimize external impacts to adjoining residential areas. The planning commission may require a buffer strip of at least 20 feet in width along any or all property boundaries which adjoin existing residential areas or nonresidential uses. Any required buffer shall be permanently vegetated and maintained as common open space. Portions of the development that do not contain developable land area may be used to satisfy the buffer requirement, however, no designated buffer strip may be improved in order to acquire a density bonus. 
                  If the planning commission determines that the aforementioned buffer requirements constitute excessive constraints on the cluster design or are otherwise inappropriate for the specific development site, then the applicant may be allowed to place house lots along the development boundary, provided the proposed lots satisfy the standard dimensional requirements of the applicable zoning district, and that the houses constructed on the border lots are of a similar unit type as the existing homes adjoining the proposed cluster development. 
                  90.3.7. Water and sewer. All units in a cluster development must be served by municipal water and sewer. 
                  90.3.8. Underground utilities. All units in a cluster development shall be served by underground utilities. 
                  90.3.9. Emergency services. All cluster developments shall be designed to facilitate access for emergency services. Where questions regarding emergency service access arise during development review, the planning commission may request that the applicant receive a written statement from the Gray Fire Chief and/or the Gray Police Chief stating that the proposed development, as designed, will not create an undue burden on the provision of emergency services. 
                  90.3.10. Streets. All cluster developments must comply with all street design requirements of this ordinance. No reduction in street dimensional standards shall be authorized by the planning commission. 
                  90.3.11. Entrance ways. To facilitate emergency vehicle access, each cluster development consisting of more than 40 units shall provide at least two development entrance ways separated by not less than 200 feet on center line. Additional development entrances may be proposed at the discretion of the applicant, however no development consisting of less than 200 units shall have more than four entrance ways. 
                  90.3.12. Drainage. The planning commission may require the construction of storm water detention or retention areas within cluster developments to prevent runoff and erosion and sedimentation impacts on neighboring developments. Where such drainage improvements are required, adequate maintenance provisions shall be included in the restrictive covenants, association bylaws, or rules for the development as prescribed in section 90.3.13. Any stormwater detention or retention areas shall be considered open spaces, however they must be maintained in a natural or vegetated state. 
                  90.3.13. Maintenance of common areas. Every cluster development shall include provisions for maintenance of all areas within the development under common ownership as prescribed below. 
                  No lot or dwelling unit in a development containing open space shall be sold until a corporation, association, property owner's group, or similar entity has been formed with the right to assess all the properties which are jointly owned with interests in the common areas and facilities in the entire development or in the tract which is a part of the entire development to meet the expense of such entity, and with authority to control, and the duty to regularly maintain all of said mutually available features of the development or tract portion thereof. In addition, the homeowner's association bylaws or rules shall contain provisions authorizing the local government to maintain 
                  said open space at the association's expense and upon 15 days advance written notice to the association, if the association has not properly maintained any or all open space entrusted to it. Such entity shall operate under recorded conditions, covenants and restrictions which may include compulsory memberships of all owners of lots and/or dwelling units, and flexibility of assessments to meet changing costs of maintenance, repairs, and services. The developer shall submit evidence of compliance with these requirements to the planning commission. This condition shall not apply to land dedicated to the city for public purposes. 
                  90.3.14. Pedestrian access. Where a proposed cluster development contains multiple improved recreational facilities, adequate provision for safe pedestrian access to such facilities and open space areas shall be provided. Furthermore, any proposed or required sidewalks within a cluster development shall tie into existing public sidewalks that adjoin the proposed development. 
                  90.3.15. Compliance with state laws. All units within a cluster development under common ownership shall satisfy all applicable regulations of the "Georgia Condominium Act" (O.C.G.A. § 85.16E). 
                  90.4. Dimensional requirements. Cluster developments shall be constructed in accordance with the preliminary subdivision or site plan as approved by the planning commission. Within a cluster development, the planning commission may authorize the following changes to the dimensional requirements contained in article IX. 
                  90.4.1. Lot size reductions. The minimum lot areas specified in section 90 of this ordinance for lots with public sewer access may be reduced in cluster developments as specified below for the applicable zoning district: 

                   
                  The planning commission may allow additional reductions in the minimum lot sizes specified above in order to accommodate additional units resulting from a density bonus, as long as the additional lot area reductions do not exceed ten percent for any proposed unit type. 
                  90.4.2. Lot width reductions. The minimum lot widths specified in section 90 of this ordinance for lots with public sewer access may be reduced in cluster developments as specified below for the applicable zoning district: 

                   
                  The planning commission may allow additional reductions in the minimum lot widths specified above in order to accommodate additional units resulting from a density bonus, as long as the additional lot width reductions do not exceed ten feet for any proposed unit type. 
                  90.4.3. Coverage and impervious surface ratios. The maximum lot coverage shall be 35 percent for cluster developments that do not involve a density bonus and 40 percent for cluster developments with an approved density bonus. In addition, no more than 45 percent of all land within the cluster development may be covered by impervious surfaces, including roads, sidewalks, paved parking areas, and structures. 
                  90.4.4. Front yard requirements. To promote maximum utility of private rear yards, the minimum permitted front yard setback shall be 15 feet. Unless required by the planning commission, no front yard setback shall exceed 30 feet. No reduction in front yard setbacks shall be allowed for lots fronting a collector or arterial highway.

General requirements for all telecommunications facilities: The requirements set forth in this section shall govern the location and construction of all telecommunications facilities governed by this ordinance unless the governing authority reduces the standards if the goals of this section would be better served thereby: 
                  (1)  Building codes and safety standards: To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the governing authority concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said 30 days, the governing authority may remove such tower at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the governing authority shall be in the manner provided in sections 41-2-8—41-2-17 of the Official Code of Georgia. 
                  (2)  Regulatory compliance: 
                  a.  All telecommunications facilities must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate telecommunications facilities. If such standards and regulations are changed then the owners of the telecommunications facilities governed by this section shall bring such telecommunications facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the date established by the agency promulgating the standards or regulations. 
                  b.  Owners of telecommunications facilities shall provide documentation showing that each telecommunications facility is in compliance with all applicable federal and state requirements. Evidence of compliance must be submitted every 12 months. 
                  c.  Failure to bring towers and antenna into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for removal of the tower at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the governing authority shall be in the manner provided in sections 41-2-8—41-2-17 of the Official Code of Georgia. 
                  (3)  Security: All telecommunications facilities shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device or other similar protective device to prevent unauthorized access to the telecommunications facility. A black or non-obtrusive vinyl clad chain link fence or wall not less than eight feet in height from finished grade shall be provided around each communication tower or antenna. Barbed wire shall not be used along the top of the fence or wall. Access to the tower or antenna shall be through a locked gate. 
                  (4)  Lighting: For all towers that are required to be illuminated a dual lighting mode of red at night and strobe during day shall be allowed. Strobe at night shall not be permitted. 
                  (5)  Advertising: No advertising is permitted on telecommunications facilities. However, a whip antenna may be allowed on any legally permitted permanent billboard or outdoor advertising sign as long as the other requirements of this section are met. 
                  (6)  Visual impact: 
                  a.  Telecommunications facilities shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color or painted and/or textured to match the existing structure so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  b.  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and associated electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. Roof-mounted antennas shall be made visually unobtrusive by screening to match existing air conditioning units, stairs, elevator towers or other background. 
                  c.  Where feasible, telecommunications facilities should be placed directly above, below or incorporated with vertical design elements of a building to help in camouflaging. 
                  d.  Telecommunications facilities shall not be sited where they negatively affect historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or any state or federal law or agency or where they will create visual clutter. 
                  e.  Any equipment shelter or cabinet that supports telecommunications facilities must be concealed from public view or made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained. 
                  (7)  Landscaping: 
                  a.  Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the telecommunications facility from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property. 
                  b.  Where adequate vegetation is not present, tower facilities shall be landscaped with a landscaped strip of plant materials which effectively screens the view of the tower compound. Landscaped strips shall be a minimum of ten feet in width and located outside the fenced perimeter of the compound. 
                  c.  Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. Where natural vegetation around the perimeter of the site would provide an adequate visual screen, an undisturbed buffer may be utilized. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost. 
                  d.  Landscaping shall be maintained by the provider and shall be subject to periodic review by the governing authority to assure proper maintenance. Failure to maintain landscaping shall be deemed a violation of this section. 
                  e.  The governing authority may waive or modify the landscaping requirement where lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes, for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms or where an antenna is placed on an existing structure. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be modified or waived by the governing authority. 
                  (8)  Maintenance impacts: Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector or local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector or local street. 
                  (9)  Principal, accessory and joint uses: 
                  a.  Accessory structures used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall be allowed but not be used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the telecommunications facility. 
                  b.  Telecommunications facilities may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area. 
                  (10)  Lot size and setbacks: 
                  a.  The following setback requirements shall apply to all telecommunications facilities. 
                  1.  Telecommunications towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower from any residential property line and all public rights-of-way. 
                  b.  For antennas attached to the roof of a supporting structure on a rooftop, a 1.1 setback ratio (example: ten foot high antenna and supporting structure requires ten foot setback from edge of roof) shall be maintained unless an alternative placement is shown to reduce visual impact. 
                  (11)  Change of ownership: Upon the transfer of ownership of an interest in any tower, antenna or lot upon which such a structure has been erected, the tower permittee shall notify the governing authority of the transaction in writing within 30 days. 
                  (12)  Time limit of project completion: Once a communication tower or antenna is approved, a permit shall be obtained within one year and the project shall be completed within one year of approval by the city.

If the proposed excavation, filling, construction, or movement set forth in said sketch or plan are in conformity with the provision of this ordinance, and other appropriate codes and ordinances of the council then in effect, or if a variance from the provisions of this ordinance has been granted pursuant to section 114.3, the zoning enforcement officer shall sign and return one copy of the sketch plan to the applicant and shall issue a zoning compliance permit. The zoning enforcement officer shall retain one copy of the zoning compliance permit and one copy of the sketch or plan for his records. 
                  112.14. If the sketch or plan submitted describes work which does not conform to the requirements of this ordinance, the zoning enforcement officer shall not issue a zoning compliance permit, but shall return one copy of the sketch of plan to the applicant along with a signed refusal in writing. Such refusal shall state the reasons for refusal and shall cite the portions of this ordinance with which the submitted sketch plan does not comply. The zoning enforcement officer shall retain one copy of the sketch plan and two copies of the refusal. 
                  112.15. Any zoning compliance permit shall automatically expire six months from the date of issuance if the person, firm, or corporation to which the certificate or permit was issued has not clearly demonstrated that the permit is being exercised for the purpose for which it was issued, or if the work so authorized is suspended or discontinued for a period of one year. 
                  112.2. Certificate of occupancy. Certificates of occupancy shall be issued by the zoning enforcement officer in accordance with the following provisions: 
                  112.21. Certificate of occupancy required. A certificate of occupancy is required in advance of occupancy of use of: 
                  (1)  A building hereafter erected; 
                  (2)  A building hereafter altered so as to affect height, or side, front or rear yards; 
                  (3)  A change of type of occupancy or use of any building on premises. 
                  112.22. Issuance of certificate of occupancy. A certificate of occupancy shall not be issued unless the proposed use of a building or land conforms to the applicable provisions of this ordinance, or unless the building, as finally constructed, complies with the sketch plan upon which the zoning compliance permit was issued.

                  Section 113. - Establishment of the board of zoning appeals. 
                  The board of zoning appeals of the City of Gray, Georgia, is hereby established with the mayor and council acting as said board. 
                  113.1. Membership. The board of zoning appeals shall consist of the mayor and council of the City of Gray, Georgia. 
                  Section 114. - Duties and powers of the board of zoning appeals. 
                  The board of zoning appeals shall have the following duties and powers: 
                  114.1. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the zoning enforcement officer, or other administrative official, in the enforcement of this ordinance. 
                  114.2. To hear and decide special exceptions of the terms of this ordinance upon which said board is required to pass under this ordinance. 
                  114.3. Variances. To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of this ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of this ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Such variance may be granted in such individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the board of appeals that: 
                  114.31. There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography, and 
                  114.32. The application of this ordinance to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship, and 
                  114.33. Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved, and 
                  114.34. Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purpose and intent of this ordinance; provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by this ordinance. 
                  114.4. Use variance prohibited. Said board may not grant any variance for a use of land or premises other than the one permitted in section 114.3. 
                  Section 115. - Procedure for requesting a hearing before the board of zoning appeals. 
                  Requests for a hearing before the board of zoning appeals for an administrative review, special exception or a variance shall observe the following procedures: 
                  115.1. An application must be submitted in writing to the zoning enforcement officer from whom the appeal is taken and to the board of appeals a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. 
                  115.2. An application shall be accompanied by an acceptable site plan with such reasonable information shown thereon as may be required by the zoning enforcement officer. Such site plan shall include, as a minimum, the following: lot dimensions with property line monuments located thereon; location and size of existing and proposed structures; yard dimensions and the use of structures; easements (private and public), watercourses, and if existing and proposed; fences, street names and street right-of-way lines; and such other information regarding abutting property as directly affects the application. 
                  115.3. The zoning enforcement officer shall cause to have posted in a conspicuous place on the property in question one or more signs, which shall contain information as to the date, time and place of the hearing, and the address and telephone number of the zoning enforcement officer for further information. Such signs shall be posted not less than 15 days, nor more than 45 days prior to the public hearing. 
                  115.4. The board of zoning appeals shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of appeals or other matters referred to said board, give at least 15 days public notice thereof, as well as due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within 45 days from the date of such public hearing. 
                  115.5. An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the zoning enforcement officer certifies to the board of zoning appeals after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the said board or by a court of record; on application, on notice to the official from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown. 
                  115.6. In exercising the powers granted the board of zoning appeals in section 114 of this ordinance, the said board may, in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance, reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or may modify the order, requirements, decisions or determination of the zoning enforcement officer and may issue or direct the issuance of zoning compliance permit. 
                  115.7. A property owner, or his appointed agent, shall not initiate action for a hearing before the board of zoning appeals relating to the same parcel of land more often than once every 12 months on the same variance. 
                  115.8. Any petition for a hearing before the board of zoning appeals may be withdrawn prior to action thereon by said board at the discretion of the person, firm or corporation initiating such a request upon written notice to the secretary of said board. 
                  115.9. Any person or persons severally or jointly aggrieved by any decision of the board of zoning appeals may take an appeal to the superior court as provided in O.C.G.A. § 69-1211.1.

Such notification shall be mailed not less than 15, nor more than 45 days prior to the hearing. Failure to receive such notification shall not constitute administrative error. 
                  116.32. Upon the establishment of a hearing date for any application for a conditional use permit, the zoning enforcement officer shall cause to have posted in a conspicuous place on the property in question one or more signs, containing the time, date, and place of the hearing, and the address and telephone number of the zoning enforcement officer for further information. Such sign or signs shall be posted not less than 15, nor more than 45 days prior to the hearing. 
                  116.33.

Such notice shall include the nature of the application, the time, date, and place of the hearing upon said application, and the address and telephone number of the zoning enforcement officer, should additional information be required. Such notice shall be published not less than 15, nor more than 45 days prior to the hearing. 
                  116.34.

                  116.4. Hearing and decision. The following provisions shall apply to hearings upon applications for a conditional use permit: 
                  116.41. The city council shall decide upon applications for conditional use permits using the following standards: 
                  116.41.1. The proposed use or structure shall be compatible with development and uses existing on adjacent and nearby property. 
                  116.41.2. The proposed use or structure shall not have a substantial adverse impact upon the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property. 
                  116.41.3. The proposed use or structure shall not cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities, schools, or other public facilities. 
                  116.41.4. Any other relevant factors, including the conformity of the proposed development with duly adopted land use and other physical development plans or policies for the area, may also be considered. 
                  116.41.5. Whenever the application for a conditional use permit is for a sign, the city council shall consider the criteria contained in section 97.7(3)(a) in addition to the standards set out in [sections] 116.41.1 through 116.41.4. 
                  116.41.6. Whenever the application for a conditional use permit is for a telecommunications tower, the city council shall consider the criteria contained in section 100 in addition to the standards set out in 116.41.1 through 116.41.4. 
                  116.42. The city council shall hear applications for conditional use permits in accordance with such rules as it may adopt for such proceedings. The city council shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question, or if absent and failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other formal actions. All records shall be kept in the office of the city clerk and shall be open for public inspection. 
                  116.43. Following a public hearing upon an application for a conditional use permit, the city council shall consider and decide upon said application within 45 days following the hearing. 
                  116.44. In response to comments made by persons appearing at the hearing or to city council's recommendations, the applicant may agree to modify his application, including any plans or specifications submitted. Unless such modifications are so substantial that the city council determines that revised plans are necessary for adequate consideration of the application, the city council may approve the application with the stipulation that the permit or certificate shall not be issued until plans reflecting the agreed upon changes are submitted to the zoning enforcement officer. 
                  116.45. Any decision made by the city council upon an application for a conditional use permit shall be reduced to writing and served upon the applicant and shall be made a public record and maintained in the office of the city clerk and with a copy on file in the office of the zoning enforcement officer. 
                  116.46. Whenever an application for a conditional use permit is denied, the city council shall not consider any further application for the same conditional use on the same property or any part thereof for a period of six months from the date of final denial. An application for a conditional use which is essentially the same as one previously denied shall be considered as being for the same conditional use as was previously denied. 
                  116.47. Any person, firm, or corporation whose application has been previously and finally disapproved, may, within 30 days from the date of final disapproval, move that the city council authorize a rehearing and reconsider the application. All motions for a rehearing shall be written and presented to the zoning enforcement officer, and no hearing shall be held on such motion. No motion for rehearing shall be considered unless new or additional information not available at the time of the original hearing or not presented due to excusable neglect is available. A denial of this motion is final action. The granting of this motion shall require a new hearing and a new process of notification as if the application were considered for the first time.

                  Section 117. - Continuance of previously issued permits.

                  ARTICLE XII. - PROCEDURES FOR SUBDIVISION PLAT APPROVAL 

                  Section 121. - Platting authority. 
                  The mayor and city council of Gray shall be the official platting authority. 
                  (Ord. of 6-3-1996; Ord. of 5-4-1998(2)) 
                  Section 122. - Preapplication review. 
                  Whenever the subdivision of a tract of land within the jurisdiction of the commission is proposed, the subdivider should consult early and informally with the zoning enforcement officer for advice and assistance. The subdivider may submit sketch plans and data showing existing conditions within the site and in its vicinity and the proposed layout and development of the subdivision. The zoning enforcement officer shall return within 15 days the submitted sketch plans to the subdivider and shall inform the subdivider where the plans do not comply with the regulations set forth in this ordinance. No fee shall be charged for the preapplication review and no formal application shall be required. 
                  Section 123. - Procedure for preliminary plat approval. 
                  Prior to the cutting or grading of any street or the making of any street improvements or the installation of utilities, the subdivider shall submit to the commission a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision in accordance with the following procedure: 
                  123.1. Application for preliminary plat approval. Following the preapplication review of a proposed subdivision, the subdivider shall submit to the zoning enforcement officer a complete application for review and approval of a preliminary plat. 
                  123.11. If the property being subdivided does not abut any part of the state highway system, the subdivider shall submit to the zoning enforcement officer an application for approval of preliminary plat, and four copies of the preliminary plat and other documents, as specified in section 124 herein. The mayor and city council of Gray shall act on the preliminary plat at its next regular meeting, no less than ten calendar days from the date of receipt of a complete application by the zoning enforcement officer. 
                  123.12. If the property being subdivided abuts any part of the state highway system, the subdivider shall submit to the zoning enforcement officer an application for approval of preliminary plat and seven copies of the preliminary plat and other documents, as specified in section 124 herein. The zoning enforcement officer shall forward three copies of the preliminary plat and other documents to the Georgia Department of Transportation District Office for review and approval, or disapproval, in accordance with the O.C.G.A. § 32-6-151. The commission shall act on the preliminary plat at its next regular meeting no less than ten calendar days from the date of receipt of a complete application by the zoning enforcement officer or at the next regular meeting of the mayor and city council of Gray no less than ten calendar days from the date of receipt of the decision of the Georgia Department of Transportation by the zoning enforcement officer, whichever is later. Applications for preliminary plat approval for subdivisions of property abutting the state highway system that do not include all of the above items shall not be considered complete. Approval of a subdivision plat does not relieve the subdivider of the requirement to obtain a commercial driveway permit from the Georgia Department of Transportation. 
                  123.2. Georgia Department of Transportation recommendations. In accordance with O.C.G.A. § 32-6-151, the zoning enforcement officer shall submit three copies of the preliminary plat to the Georgia Department of Transportation if the proposed subdivision includes or abuts on any part of the state highway system. The department of transportation, within 30 days of receipt of the plat, shall recommend approval or disapproval and note its recommendation on the copy to be returned to the zoning enforcement officer. Failure of the department of transportation to act within this 30-day period shall constitute a recommendation for approval. If the plat is recommended for disapproval, the reasons for disapproval and requirements for approval shall be given to the zoning enforcement officer in writing; but such recommendations shall be advisory only and shall not be binding on the mayor and city council of Gray. Approval of a subdivision plat does not relieve the subdivider of the requirement to obtain a commercial driveway permit from the Georgia Department of Transportation. 
                  123.3. Notice of hearing. Notice of time and place of hearing shall be sent by registered mail to the address of the subdivider not less than five days before the date fixed therefore. It shall be the responsibility of the zoning enforcement officer to send the said notice. 
                  123.4. Review of preliminary plat. The zoning enforcement officer shall check the plat for conformance to the rules and regulations of this ordinance and report his findings and recommendations to the commission, which shall afford a hearing on the preliminary plat. 
                  123.41. Preliminary approval. Following the hearing of the preliminary plat and other related material, the commission may express preliminary approval noting the conditions of such approval on four copies of the preliminary plat with one copy being returned to the subdivider, one copy to the Jones County Health Department and one copy to the office of the building inspector for the council and one copy to be added to the records of the commission. Approval of a preliminary plat does not constitute approval of a final plat. It indicates only approval of the layout as a guide to the preparation of the final plat. 
                  123.42. Expiration time. Preliminary approval shall expire and be of no further effect 12 months from the date of the preliminary approval unless the time is extended by the commission. 
                  123.43. Disapproval. Following the hearing of the preliminary plat and other related material, the commission may find reasons detrimental to the public safety, health, and general welfare, or in conflict with adopted plans of the commission which required the disapproval of the preliminary plat. A statement of the reasons for disapproval shall be made on two copies of the preliminary plat with one copy being returned to the subdivider and one copy being added to the records of the commission. The applicant may reapply for preliminary plat approval in accordance with section 123.1 herein. 
                  123.44. Automatic approval. Failure of the commission to act on the preliminary plat within 30 days after submission thereof, without due cause, shall be deemed to be approval of the plat and a certificate of preliminary approval shall be issued by the commission on demand; provided, however, that the subdivider may waive this requirement and consent to an extension of time. 
                  Section 124. - Preliminary plat specifications. 
                  124.1. Scale. The preliminary plat shall be clearly legibly drawn at a scale not smaller than 200 feet to one inch. 
                  124.2. Sheet size. Sheet size shall not be greater than 18 inches by 24 inches. If the complete plat cannot be shown on sheet of this size, it may be shown on more than one sheet with an index map on a separate sheet of a reduced scale. 
                  124.3. Ground elevations. The preliminary plat shall show ground elevations, based on the datum plane of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. 
                  124.31. For land that slopes less than approximately two percent, spot elevations shall be shown at all breaks in grade, along all drainage channels or swales, and at selected points not more than 100 feet apart in all directions. 
                  124.32. For land that slopes more than approximately two percent, contours shall be shown with an interval of not more than five feet if the ground slope is regular or with an interval of not more than two feet if the ground slope is irregular. 
                  124.33. A tie to one or more bench marks shall be shown. 
                  124.34. An exception to above requirements for showing ground elevation is a preliminary plat of a subdivision located in any subdivision with the average size of the lots being greater than one acre. A preliminary plat of such subdivisions shall show only the location of streams (both perennial and intermittent); direction of flow of these streams; any areas subject to flooding; and selected spot elevations. 
                  124.4. Information to be provided on preliminary plat. The preliminary plat shall contain the following information: 
                  (1)  Name and address of owner of record and of subdivider. 
                  (2)  Proposed name of subdivision and its acreage. 
                  (3)  North point and graphic scale and date. 
                  (4)  Vicinity map showing location and acreage of the subdivision. 
                  (5)  Exact boundary lines of the tract by bearings and distance. 
                  (6)  Names of owners of record of adjoining land with its approximate acreage. 
                  (7)  Existing streets, utilities and easements on and adjacent to the tract, including the size and width of each. 
                  (8)  Proposed layout including streets, alleys and easements with both dimensions and proposed street names; lot lines with approximate dimensions; land to be reserved or dedicated for public uses; and any land to be used for purpose other than single-family dwellings. 
                  (9)  Block letters and lot numbers. 
                  (10)  Provisions for water supply, sewerage and drainage. Engineering drawings or topographical drawings by a surveyor or engineer sufficient in the opinion of city council to determine proper drainage and provide for drainage for the entire subdivision. If city water is to be used, the preliminary shall be accompanied by appropriate approvals from the city superintendent or other designated official. See sections 146.1 and 146.2. 
                  (11)  Minimum building front yard setback lines. 
                  (12)  Such typical street cross-sections and centerline profiles as may be required. 
                  (13)  Location of streams, lakes, and swamps and land subject to flooding as determined from past history of flooding. 
                  (14)  Location of land dedicated for a neighborhood park or open space area for subdivisions exceeding ten lots. 
                  (15)  Existing zoning district classification of the proposed subdivision and of adjoining properties.

                  (17)  A sketch plan of all future subdivisions contemplated by the subdivider within and adjacent to the tract of land for which this preliminary plat is submitted, as required by the zoning enforcement officer. 
                  124.5. Certificate of preliminary approval. A certificate of approval of the preliminary plat by the commission shall be inscribed on the plat as follows: 
                  "In that all the requirements of preliminary approval having been fulfilled, this subdivision plat was given preliminary approval by the mayor and city council of Gray on ____________ , 19[20] ____________ ." The preliminary approval does not constitute approval of the final plat. This certificate of preliminary approval shall expire and be null and void on 19[20] ____________ ." 

                   
                  124.6. Initiation of installing physical improvements. After receiving a certificate of preliminary approval by the commission, the subdivider may then proceed to grade the streets and install all improvements required under this ordinance and any other applicable regulations of the council. In lieu of the completion of all improvements prior to submission of the final plat, the subdivider may post a performance bond with the treasurer of the council in an amount and with survey conditions satisfactory to it, providing for and assuring to the council the actual construction and installation of such improvements within the period of time specified by the commission and stated in the bond. 
                  124.7. Approval for the health department. If city sewerage is not available as specified in section 146.2, then a signed certificate of approval of the Jones County Health Department shall be replaced on the preliminary plat. Prior to approval from the Jones Health Department, the subdivider shall present a percolation test data results on each lot in the proposed subdivision, provided the lot size is not greater that three acres. The percolation tests and test boring shall be performed in accordance with Ga. Dept. of Human Resources manual for On Site Sewage Management Systems, Sections A-290-526-10, when required. The Jones County Health Department may in discretion of its inspector allow percolation tests on less than all lots provided tests are sufficient to protect purchasers of lots.

                  After completion of the physical development of the subdivision or the posting of a performance bond, the subdivider shall submit to the commission a final plat in accordance with the following procedure: 
                  125.1. Application for final plat approval. After the preliminary plat of a proposed land subdivision has been given preliminary approval by the commission, the subdivider, may within one year or within such additional time as may be granted by the commission, submit to the zoning enforcement officer the following items. The mayor and city council of Gray shall act on the final plat no less than ten days and no more than 30 days from the date of receipt of a complete application by the zoning enforcement officer. 
                  125.11. A letter requesting review and approval of the final plat. 
                  125.12. Five printed copies of the final plat with signed certifications and other documents as specified in section 126 herein. 
                  125.13. A final plat filing fee of $4.00 per lot shown on the final plat at the time of filing the final plat. 
                  125.2. Review of the final plat. The zoning enforcement officer shall check the plat for conformance with the tentatively approved preliminary plat, and with regulations of this ordinance. 
                  125.21. Notice of hearing. Notice of time and place of hearing shall be sent by registered mail to the address of the subdivider not less than five days before the date fixed therefore. It shall be the responsibility of the zoning enforcement officer to send the said notice. 
                  125.22. Office approval. The zoning enforcement officer may give final approval in the name and on behalf of the commission provided the final plat is the same as that granted preliminary approval by the commission and that all conditions specified by the commission and specified herein have been met; and shall sign a certificate of approval on all printed drawings with two copies being returned to the subdivider, one copy to the Jones County Health Department, one copy to the office of the building inspector for the council and one copy being added to the records of the commission. No final plat shall be approved by the zoning enforcement officer until the required certifications have been approved by the appropriate approving agents as required in section 126. 
                  125.23. Disapproval. The commission or the zoning enforcement officer may find the final plat in conflict with the tentatively approved preliminary plat or with this ordinance requiring the disapproval of the final plat. A statement of the reasons for disapproval shall be placed on two copies of the final plat with one copy being returned to the subdivider and one copy being added to the records of the commission. No certificate of approval shall be given. The final plat may be resubmitted as a new application for final plat approval for hearing after the corrections noted by the commission are made. 
                  125.24. Automatic approval. Failure of the commission to act on the final plat within 30 days after submission thereof shall be deemed to be approval of the plat and a certificate of final approval shall be issued by the commission on demand; provided, however, that the subdivider may waive this requirement and consent to an extension of time.

                  132.3. Street names. Street names shall require the approval of the commission. Streets that are obviously in alignment with streets already in existence and already names shall be given the name of the existing street. Names of new streets shall not duplicate or closely approximate those existing streets. 
                  132.4. Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall not be permitted. 
                  132.5. Cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sacs, or dead-end streets, shall not be greater in length than 800 feet. They shall be provided at the closed end with a turn-around having a right-of-way radius of at least 60 feet, with an outside pavement radius of at least 50 feet.

                  132.6. Development along major street, limited-access highway or railroad right-of-way. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an expressway, freeway, arterial or collector street, or a railroad right-of-way, the commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way either as a marginal access street, or at a distance suitable for an appropriate use of intervening land, with a nonaccess reservation suitably planted. Due regard should be given requirements for approach grades and future grade separations in determining distances. Lots shall have no access to expressways, freeways, or arterial streets, but only to an accessible street in which case the commission may require double frontage lots. 
                  132.7. Half streets. Half streets shall be prohibited except where essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of these regulations, and where the commission finds it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining property is subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract. 
                  132.8. Alleys. The requirements for providing alleys within a subdivision are as follows:

                  132.91. Reserve strips controlling the access to streets shall be prohibited except where this control is definitely placed in the hands of the council under conditions approved by the commission. The commission may control access to expressways, freeways, arterial and collector streets by requiring all lots to face and have access to only minor streets. 
                  132.92. Easements having a minimum width of ten feet and located along the side or rear lot lines shall be provided, as is necessary for utility lines and underground mains and cables. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, channel or streams, there shall be provided a stormwater or drainage right-of-way of adequate width.

                  134.31. The entire right-of-way shall be provided where any part of the subdivision is on both sides of the existing streets. 
                  134.32. When the subdivision is located on one side of an existing street one-half of the required right-of-way, measured from the centerline of the existing roadway, shall be provided. 
                  134.4. Obstruction of vision at intersections. On a corner lot and at the intersection of all subdivision entranceways and a public highway, there shall be no obstruction to vision between the height of three feet and ten feet above the average grade of each street within the triangular area formed by the intersection of the two roads and a line joining them at points 25 feet away from the intersection of the outermost pavement edges as measured along the outer edge of the paved roadway.

                  154.1. Whether the proposed amendment would permit a use that is suitable in view of the use and development of adjacent and nearby property. 
                  154.2. Whether the proposed amendment would adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property. 
                  154.3. Whether the property to be affected by the proposed amendment has a reasonable economic use as currently zoned. 
                  154.4. Whether the proposed amendment would result in a use which would or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities, schools, or other public facilities. 
                  154.5. Whether the proposed amendment is in conformity with the policy or intent of any duly adopted land use or other physical development plan. 
                  154.6. Whether there are other existing or changing conditions affecting the use and development of the property which give supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the proposed amendment. 
                  154.7. The following additional standards shall apply to decisions upon applications or proposals for amendment of the official zoning maps involving a HD historic overlay district: 
                  154.71. Whether the area has a special character or special historic or aesthetic value or interest. 
                  154.72. Whether the area represents one or more periods or styles of architecture typical of one or more eras in the history of the county, state, or region. 
                  154.73. Whether the foregoing factors cause such area to constitute a visibly perceptible section of the county. 
                  Section 155. - Request for rehearing. 
                  Any person, firm, corporation, or organization whose application has been previously and finally disapproved may, within 30 days from the date of final disapproval, move that city council authorize a rehearing of and reconsider the application. All motions for the rehearing of an application shall be written and submitted to the zoning enforcement officer, and no hearing shall be held upon such motion. No motion for rehearing shall be considered unless new or additional information not available at the time of the original hearing or not presented due to excusable neglect is available. A denial of such motion is a final action. The granting of such motion shall require a new hearing and a new process of notification as if the application were considered for the first time. 
                  Section 156. - Printing and distributing this article. 
                  The zoning enforcement officer shall cause to be reproduced and shall keep available copies of this article for distribution to the general public. This article contains provisions required under "The Zoning Procedure Law" (O.C.G.A. tit. 36, ch. 66). Distribution of this article shall conform to the requirements set forth in said law. 
                  Section 157. - Reserved. 
                  ARTICLE XVI. - ENFORCEMENT AND REMEDIES 

                  Section 161. - Violation. 
                  This ordinance is adopted pursuant to the 1982 Constitution of the State of Georgia. A violation of any provision of this ordinance constitutes an offense punishable in Recorders [Municipal] Court, and every day such violation continues shall be deemed as a separate offense. 
                  Section 162. - Zoning enforcement. 
                  It shall be unlawful to construct, reconstruct, or alter any building or other structure without first obtaining a zoning compliance permit or conditional use permit from the zoning enforcement officer or to use such building or structure or any land without first obtaining a certificate of occupancy from the zoning enforcement officer. The zoning enforcement officer shall not issue any permit unless the requirements of this ordinance are complied with. 
                  Section 163. - Subdivision enforcement. 
                  163.1. The filing or recording of a plat of a subdivision without approval of the mayor and city council of Gray constitutes a violation of this ordinance, and the description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other document used in the process of selling or transfer shall not exempt the transaction from such penalties. City council, through its attorney or other designated official, may enjoin such transfer or sale or agreement by appropriate action. 
                  163.2. No plat or plan of subdivision with the City of Gray shall be filed or recorded by a subdivider in the office of the Clerk of the Superior Court of Jones County until it shall have been submitted to and approved by the mayor and city council of Gray and such approval entered in writing on the plat by the zoning enforcement officer of the city attorney. The clerk of the superior court shall not file or record a plat of a subdivision which does not have the approval of the zoning enforcement officer or city attorney. 
                  (Ord. of 6-3-1996; Ord. of 5-4-1998(2)) 
                  Section 164. - Remedies. 
                  In case any building or structure is or is proposed to be erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, converted, or maintained, or any building, structure of land is or is proposed to be used in violation of the ordinance, the zoning enforcement officer, county attorney, or other appropriate authority of Gray or any adjacent or neighboring property owner who would be specially damaged by such violation may, in addition to other remedies, institute injunction, mandamus, or other appropriate action or proceeding to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion, maintenance, or use, or to correct or abate such violation, or to prevent the occupancy of said building, structure, or land. 
                  Section 165. - Speculative rezonings. 
                  The City of Gray discourages the use of rezonings as a strategy to increase speculative land value where the applicant has no intent to develop in accordance with the rezoning. Rezonings are intended to grant the applicant an opportunity to exercise appropriate alternative development options in situations where development in compliance with existing zoning is not possible or practicable, as long as the proposed alternative uses are consistent with the comprehensive plan and the character of the surrounding area. The granting of this privilege by the city carries with it the expectation that appropriate development will occur. Therefore, when the city council grants approval of a rezoning, the applicant should acquire a building permit or final plat approval (whichever is applicable) and commence construction activities in compliance with that permit or approval within one year of the date upon which the rezoning is approved. If such actions have not been taken within the specified time frame, the planning commission may initiate procedures to further rezone the property in question. 
                  ARTICLE XVII. - LEGAL STATUS PROVISIONS
