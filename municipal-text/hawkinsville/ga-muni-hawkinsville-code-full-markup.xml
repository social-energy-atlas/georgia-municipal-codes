PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Hawkinsville, Georgia, of a general and permanent nature. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1969 Code, as supplemented through November 27, 1973, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1969 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Numbering System 
                  The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-2 and the first section of Chapter 4 is 4-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
                  Indices 
                  The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Successfully keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of John Drombroski, Vice President for production, and Elizabeth Butler, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
                  The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Evelyn Herrington, City Clerk, and city staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  Sec. 2-111. - Declaration of policy. 
                  (a)	Those who are elected to serve the public as representatives accept a public trust, which they share with those whom they elect, appoint, hire, or otherwise enlist to help them serve the public. The public entrusts its power and resources to its servants to use only in the public interest. Public trust requires public servants to fulfill their public duties faithfully and honestly, and to subordinate any personal interest which conflicts with the public interest. Public trust also requires that acts which are contrary to the public interest be defined and prohibited; that there be an orderly procedure for raising and addressing ethical questions; that ethical behavior be encouraged and suitably rewarded; that unethical behavior be discouraged and suitably disciplined through a process which is fundamentally fair. 
                  (b)	It is the responsibility of each public servant to act in a manner which contributes to cultivating public trust in the integrity of government. Public trust in the integrity of government is cultivated when individual public servants act with integrity and when the public is aware that its servants act with integrity.

                  (3)	To require the public servants to engage in ethical practices which always meet minimum standards; 
                  (4)	To encourage public servants to pursue the highest ethical ideals which they can achieve;
                  (5)	To provide a process by which public service may identify and resolve ethical issues;
                  (6)	To inform public servants and the public of the minimum standards to which public servants must adhere; 
                  (7)	To promote public confidence in the integrity of public servants;
                  (8)	To encourage members of the public to seek public office or employment, to serve on public boards, to assist public servants as volunteers, and to take pride in participating in the governmental process; 
                  (9)	To establish penalties, as appropriate, for public servants who violate the public trust; and 
                  (10)	To provide for a just and reasonable balance among the rights of all individuals who are directly affected by the operation of this article.

                  (e)	In addition to the procedures and remedies in this chapter, a governing authority may provide by ordinance that designated public officers may issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted by ordinance, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and seek to enforce such citations in a court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this article. 
                  (f)	Nothing in this article shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings.

                  It shall be unlawful and a violation of the laws and ordinances of this city for any person to dig or cause to be dug any well within the corporate limits of the city until a written application for a permit for such well has been passed on and approved by the board of commissioners. 
                  (Ord. of 10-21-75)
                  Sec. 9-27. - Permit application. 
                  (a)	Any person desiring to dig or cause to be dug a well within the corporate limits of the city shall first apply in writing to the board of commissioners of such proposal to dig a well and set forth in such application information concerning the location of the proposed well, anticipated depth of the proposed well and the uses to be made of the same. The application shall set forth the name of the person who shall dig or bore the well with the proposed method to be used in digging. Details, including the size and depth of such boring, shall be specified in the application. 
                  (b)	The application filed with the city clerk shall be signed by the person on whose property the well is to be dug and by the person or representative of the firm which proposes to bore or dig the well, affirming those statements made in the application to be true.

                  Sec. 9-28. - Hearing. 
                  Upon the filing of an application for a permit under this article, the applicant shall be notified of the time and place of a hearing to be held by the board of commissioners on the application as to whether or not permission will be granted for such digging. The applicant may appear before the board of commissioners on the question of whether the permit should be granted and present evidence and argument in his own behalf.

                  Sec. 9-29. - Recording, notice of board action on applications. 
                  The board of commissioners shall consider the application for a permit under this article and all the facts and circumstances and either grant the permit or deny the application for the permit. In either event, the action of the board of commissioners shall be recorded and the city clerk shall notify the applicant of the action taken by the board on the application. 
                  (Ord. of 10-21-75)
                  Sec. 9-30. - General guideline principles. 
                  The board of commissioners, in passing upon applications for permits to dig wells, repair the same, install pumps or abandon wells, shall be guided by the standards as set forth herein. In passing on such applications, the board shall be guided by the duty to protect the health and sanitation of the citizens of the city and should take into account that hazards usually increase where the water table is at a comparatively shallow depth, particularly in populous areas. Sewer lines, septic tanks, leaching fields, fertilizers, industrial wastes, pesticides and other chemicals, cesspools, outdoor toilets and other like conditions are potential sources of contaminants and pollutants. Improperly constructed wells and abandoned wells can be avenues for carrying contaminants to the aquifer. If the top of the well is not properly protected, surface contaminants can enter the well and the groundwater. Similarly, if the space between the wall of the drill holes and the casing is not sealed in the upper part of the well and if this space is not protected from pollution down to the water table, then the space surrounding the casing can act as a conduit for carrying pollutants to the aquifer. These general principles shall be standards or guidelines in applying the more particular standards as set forth herein and in passing on whether or not permission shall be granted or denied on any application referred to herein. 
                  (Ord. of 10-21-75)
                  Sec. 9-31. - Factors of consideration generally. 
                  (a)	The board of commissioners shall grant or deny the well permit after considering:
                  (1)	The location of the proposed well and its effect on the water supply in the immediate area of the proposed well and underground waters nearby, as well as the general supply of water lying underground in and about the city. 
                  (2)	The general porosity of the soil in the area in which the well is proposed to be dug, taking into account the septic tanks in the general vicinity which will affect the water supply in and about the area where the well is proposed to be bored. Drain lines from such septic tanks as may be in the area and other factors affecting the surface water and seepage shall be considered in this respect. 
                  (3)	The proposed method of construction as outlined by the applicant shall be considered, taking into account protective measures proposed to be used to prevent pollution of underground waters and any underground source of waters which the proposed well may tap. 
                  (4)	Any other factor which may bear upon the water supply of the city and the sources of the supply, including the density of population in and about the area in which permission is sought to dig the well. 
                  (b)	The board shall not arbitrarily deny a permit for the digging of a well. In all applications an opportunity shall be given for hearing before the board of commissioners by the applicant in support of his application. 
                  (Ord. of 10-21-75)
                  Sec. 9-32. - Determining factors, standards. 
                  The board of commissioners shall grant or deny the permit under this article after considering the factors hereinafter set forth which shall be determining factors or standards in granting or denying the permit: 
                  (1)	The geological formations and structures underlying the area in which the well is proposed to be dug must be suitable for the purpose; 
                  (2)	Hydrology and hydraulic characteristics of the aquifers;
                  (3)	Density of population;
                  (4)	Estimated demands for water;
                  (5)	Depth to the groundwater table;
                  (6)	Character of subsoil formation;
                  (7)	Quality of groundwater;
                  (8)	Depletion rate of groundwater resources;
                  (9)	Sources of groundwater pollution;
                  (10)	Such other factors as may be relevant to the protection of the public health.

                  f.	Depth and thickness of grout;
                  g.	Casing information: length, inside diameter, well thickness, type of material;
                  h.	Screen information: length, trade name, inside and outside diameter, slot size, type of material; 
                  i.	Static water level;
                  j.	Water level when pumped at the designed rate;
                  k.	Yield of well in gallons per minute or hour.
                  (2)	Requirements for drilling:

                  b.	It shall be constructed in such a manner as to maintain insofar as practicable existing natural protection against pollution of water-bearing formations and to exclude pollutants from known sources. 
                  c.	The construction of the well should seal off, insofar as practicable, water-bearing formations that are or may be polluted. 
                  d.	The well shall be constructed so that no unsealed opening will be left around the well. 
                  e.	The city shall be assured that the well is located so that it is protected from surface waters and from seepage from sources of contamination and pollution. 
                  f.	The city shall be assured by the owner and the well driller that the well casing shall extend at least twelve (12) inches above the final grade of the land surface. The earth surrounding the casing shall slope away from the well and shall be firmly tapped to prevent water from seeping down around the casing. The space between the casing and the well of the drill hole shall be filled with cement grout to a depth of at least ten (10) feet. The minimum thickness of the cement or grout shall be four (4) inches. The space between the casing and the wall of the drill hole in the remaining distance to the static water level should be filled with grout.

                  Sec. 9-34. - Repair of wells. 
                  No well shall be repaired, altered or modified in any way without first obtaining permission from the board of commissioners. To effect repairs to an existing well, application must be made setting forth pertinent information as to the name of the owner of the property where the well to be repaired is located, the person who is to perform the repairs and a description of the repairs to be made, together with a statement of the manner in which the well is to be resealed and disinfected. Such application shall be submitted in the same manner as an application to dig a well as set forth herein, and the applicant shall have notice and opportunity to be heard as to whether permission will be granted for such repairs to be made. In passing on such an application for repairs, the standards to guide the board in granting or denying such permit are: 
                  (1)	The proposed method of repairs as outlined by the applicant shall be taken into consideration, including but not limited to the protective measures proposed to be used to prevent pollution of underground waters and any underground source of water which this well taps, together with any other factor which may bear upon the water supply of the city and the sources of such supply.

                  (a)	Registration required. Each utility who occupies, uses or has facilities in the rights-of-way at the time of passage of this section, including by lease, sublease or assignment, to operate facilities located in the rights-of-way, unless specifically exempted by state or federal law or this Code, shall file a registration statement with the department within ninety (90) days of the effective date of this section.

                  1.	The name, legal status (i.e., partnership, corporation, etc.), street address, email address, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the utility filing the registration statement (the "registrant"). If the registrant is not the owner of the facility in the right-of-way, the registration shall include the name, street address, email address if applicable, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the owner.

                  (d)	[Acceptance of registration.] Acceptance of the registration shall not convey title in the rights-of-way. Acceptance of the registration is only the nonexclusive, limited right to occupy rights-of-way in the city for the limited purposes stated in the acceptance.

Beginning one (1) year after the effective date of this section, any facilities or part of a facility found in a right-of-way for which registration is required but has not been obtained unless specifically exempted by law, and for which no valid service agreement exists with the city, may be deemed to be a nuisance and an unauthorized use of the rights-of-way. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to, abating the nuisance; taking possession of the facilities, evicting the utility from the right-of-way; prosecuting the violator; and/or any other remedy provided by city ordinance or otherwise allowed in law or in equity.

                  2.

                  7.	A copy, if requested, of the registrant's certificate of authority (or other acceptable evidence of authority to operate) from the Georgia Public Service Commission and/or the FCC and any other similar approvals, permits, or agreements; and 
                  8.	A copy, if requested, of the service agreement, if applicable or other legal instrument that authorizes the utility to use or occupy the right-of-way for the purpose described in the application. 
                  (c)	Permit fees. Fees shall be determined by the director, subject to the approval by resolution of the city council. A fee schedule shall be available at the offices of the director and the city clerk and open for public inspection. 
                  (d)	Issuance of permit. If the director determines the applicant has satisfied the following requirements, the director may issue a permit. 
                  1.	Whether issuing of the approval will be consistent with this section; and
                  2.	Whether applicant has submitted a complete application and has secured all certificates and other authorizations required by law, if applicable, in order to construct facilities in the manner proposed by the applicant; and 
                  3.	The impact on safety, visual quality of the streets, traffic flow, and other users of the right-of-way and the difficulty and length of time of the project, construction or maintenance. 
                  (e)	Emergency situations. 
                  1.	Each utility shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, notify the director of any event regarding its facilities which it considers to be an emergency. The utility may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary in order to respond to the emergency. A utility who engages in an emergency excavation shall take all reasonable precautions to avoid or minimize damage to any existing facilities. 
                  2.	In the event that the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding utility facilities, the city may attempt to contact the affected utility or facilities representative. The city may take whatever action it deems necessary in order to respond to the emergency, including cut or move any of the wires, cables, amplifiers, appliances, or other parts of the facilities. The city shall not incur any liability to the utility, for such emergency actions, and the cost of such shall be paid by each utility affected by the emergency. 
                  (f)	Effective period of permit. 
                  1.	Each permit shall have a set commencement and expiration date based on information provided in the applicant's permit application. 
                  2.	The permit shall remain in place [until] construction is completed or until its expiration date unless the utility is in default. The director may give written notice of default to a utility if it is determined that a utility has: 
                  a.	Violated any provision or requirement of the issuance or acceptance of a permit application or any law of the city, state, or federal government; 
                  b.	Attempted to evade any provision or requirement of this section;
                  c.	Practiced any fraud or deceit upon the city; or
                  d.	Made a material misrepresentation or omission of fact in its permit application.
                  (g)	Cancellation for cause. If a utility fails to cure a default within twenty (20) working days after such notice is provided to the utility by the city, then such default shall be a material breach and city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity to terminate the permit. If the director decides there is cause or reason to terminate, the following procedure shall be followed: 
                  1.	City shall serve a utility with a written notice of the reason or cause for proposed termination and shall allow a utility a minimum of fifteen (15) calendar days to cure its breach. 
                  2.	If the utility fails to cure within fifteen (15) calendar days, the city may declare the permit terminated. 
                  (h)	Expiration of permit. If work is not begun within six (6) months of the date of issuance, the permit will automatically expire. 
                  (4)	Required minimum standards. 
                  (a)	Utility accommodation manual adopted. The 1988 Utility Accommodation Policy and Standards Manual, including all references contained therein to codes, rules, regulations, schedules, forms and appendix items, except Appendix B (Permit Forms and supporting Documents), promulgated by the State of Georgia Department of Transportation, as may be amended from time to time is hereby adopted by reference and incorporated in the article as if fully set forth herein, subject to the amendments and modification contained in this section. A copy of the manual shall be maintained at the offices of the director or his designee and open for public inspection. Any conflicts between the provisions of this section and the manual shall be resolved in favor of the manual. References to state personnel, agencies, and fees shall be interpreted, where required, as meaning the City of Hawkinsville municipal equivalents. 
                  (b)	Protection of traffic and roadway. Unless specifically in the permit, no utility may occupy the city rights-of-way unless sufficient space is available so that the free flow and safety of traffic and other capacity considerations are not unduly impaired and the installation does not prevent the department from reasonably maintaining the streets, structures, traffic control devices and other appurtenant facilities, and further provided that maintenance and operations of the facilities do not jeopardize the traffic, street structure, other users of the right-of-way or the right-of-way itself. 
                  (c)	Grading. If the grades or lines of any street within the city right-of-way are changed at any time by the city during the term of the permit and this change involves an area in which the utility's facilities are located, then the utility shall, at its own cost and expense and upon the request of the city upon reasonable notice, protect or promptly alter or relocate the facilities, or any part thereof, so as to conform with such new grades or lines. In the event the utility refuses or neglects to so protect, alter, or relocate all or part of the facilities, the city shall have the right to break through, remove, alter, or relocate all or any part of the facilities without any liability to the utility and the utility shall pay to the city the costs incurred in connection with such breaking through, removal, alteration, or relocation. 
                  (d)	Installation of poles and other wireholding structures and relocation. Unless otherwise provided in a valid service agreement, no placement of any pole or wireholding structure of the utility is to be considered a vested interest in the right-of-way, and such poles or structures are to be removed, relocated underground, or modified by the utility at its own expense whenever the city determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. The facilities shall be so located and installed as to cause minimum interference with the rights and convenience of property owners. 
                  (e)	[Notice required prior to blasting.] As provided in O.C.G.A § 25-9-6 (the Georgia Utility Facility Protection Act) and other applicable state law currently in place or as amended, no utility shall commence, perform, or engage in blasting or in excavating with mechanized excavating facilities unless and until the utility planning the blasting or excavating has given forty-eight (48) hours' notice by submitting a locate request to the utility protection center, beginning the next working day after such notice is provided, excluding hours during days other than working days. 
                  (5)	Restoration of property. 
                  (a)	Each utility shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any facilities in the rights-of-way and adjoining property or other facilities which it or its facilities damage. 
                  (b)	A utility shall be liable, at its own cost and expense, to replace, restore or repair, any street, facilities or property or structure thereon, thereunder, thereover or adjacent thereto that may become disturbed or damaged as a result of the construction or installation, operation, upgrade, repair or removal of facilities to a condition as good as or better than its condition before the work performed by the utility that caused such disturbance or damage. If the utility does not commence such replacement or repair after twenty (20) working days following written notice from the city, the city or the owner of the affected structure or property may make such replacement or repair and the utility shall pay the reasonable and actual cost of the same. 
                  (6)	Inspection. 
                  (a)	The utility shall make the construction site available to the director and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all reasonable times during the execution and upon completion of the construction. 
                  (b)	At any time, including the time of inspection, the director may order the immediate cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the health, safety, or welfare of the public, violates any law, or which violates the terms and conditions of the permit and/or this chapter or issue an order to correct work which does not conform to the permit and/or applicable standards, conditions or codes. 
                  (c)	When the construction under any permit is completed, the utility shall notify the department. 
                  (7)	Additional permits required. The utility shall obtain all construction, building or other permits or approvals as according to city ordinance, state or federal law. In addition, a permittee shall comply with all requirements of laws, shall complete work in a way as to not cause any unnecessary or unauthorized obstructions of sidewalks, streets, waterways or railways, and is responsible for all work done in the rights-of-way regardless of who performs the work. No rights-of-way obstruction or excavation may be performed when seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work, except in the case of an emergency as outlined in subsection (3)(e)2. 
                  (8)	Penalties. Every utility convicted of a violation of any provision of this section shall be punished by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation. Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the city may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief and revocation of licenses or permits. 
                  (9)	Other provisions. 
                  (a)	Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this section is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. 
                  (b)	Reservation of regulatory and police powers. The city, by issuing a written approval of registration under this chapter, does not surrender or to any extent lose, waive, impair, or lessen the lawful powers and rights, which it has now or may be hereafter vested in the city under the constitution and laws of the United States, State of Georgia and the City Charter, and under the provisions of the city's codified ordinances to regulate the use of the rights-of-way. The utility, by applying for and being issued a written permit, is deemed to acknowledge that all lawful powers and rights, regulatory power, or police power, or otherwise as are or the same may be from time to time vested in or reserved to the city, shall be in full force and effect and subject to the exercise thereof by the city at any time. A utility is deemed to acknowledge that its interests are subject to the regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public and is deemed to agree to comply with all applicable general laws enacted by the city pursuant to such powers. In particular, all utilities shall comply with city zoning and other land use requirements pertaining to the placement and specifications of facilities. 
                  (c)	Compliance. No person shall be relieved of its obligation to comply with any of the provisions of this section by reason of any failure of city to enforce compliance. 
                  (d)	Appeal of administrative decisions. All appeals provided for by this section and any notification to the city required by this section shall be in writing and sent via certified mail to the director as specified in this section. 
                  (e)	Subsection headings. Subsection headings are for convenience only and shall not be used to interpret any portion of this section.

                  Streets are hereby classified according to the function that they are to serve, the type, speed, and volume of traffic they will carry and the required standards of design. The classifications of streets and roads are as follows: 
                  a.	Arterial streets—State and U.S. numbered highways.
                  b.	Collector streets—Major streets that carry traffic between neighborhoods and arterial streets, serve nonresidential or multi-family areas or developments, and streets within a residential subdivision that collect traffic from one hundred (100) dwelling units or more. 
                  c.	Local streets—Streets in residential subdivisions that primarily provide access to individual lots, do not carry through traffic, and serve fewer than one hundred (100) dwelling units.

                  (Ord. No. 2010-2, 5-3-10)
                  Sec. 5.2.3. - Minimum requirements for erosion and sedimentation control using best management practices. 
                  a.	General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land disturbing activities which are not exempted by this ordinance shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections 5.2.3.b. and c. of this ordinance. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this ordinance and the NPDES general permit. 
                  b.	Minimum requirements/BMP's. 
                  (1)	Best management practices as set forth in subsection 5.2.3.b. and c., of this ordinance shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)	A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than twenty-five (25) nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten (10) nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five (5) acres. 
                  (3)	Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)	The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)	The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in [subsection] c.(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. 12-7-6(c). 
                  c.	The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq., for the purpose of governing land disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)	Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)	Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
                  (3)	Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)	Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
                  (5)	The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)	Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
                  (7)	Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)	Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)	To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)	Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)	Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
                  (12)	Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)	Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible; provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)	Land disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 5.2.3.b.2. of this ordinance; 
                  (15)	Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a twenty-five-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and, for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least twenty-five (25) feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  (a)	No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  (b)	The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer, and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  (i)	Stream crossings for water lines; or
                  (ii)	Stream crossings for sewer lines; and
                  (16)	There is established a fifty-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5, of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of twenty-five (25) gallons per minute or less shall have a twenty-five-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  (a)	No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  (b)	The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  (i)	Stream crossings for water lines; or
                  (ii)	Stream crossings for sewer lines.
                  d.	Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections 5.2.3.b. and c. of this ordinance. 
                  e.	The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this ordinance or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 2010-2, 5-3-10)
                  Sec. 5.2.4. - Application/permit process. 
                  a.	General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this ordinance, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  b.	Application requirements. 
                  (1)	No person shall conduct any land disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Hawkinsville without first obtaining a permit from the local issuing authority (Joint Pulaski-Hawkinsviile Building Department) to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)	The application for a permit shall be submitted to the Joint Pulaski-Hawkinsviile Building Department and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation, and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection 5.2.4.c., of this ordinance. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsection 5.2.3.b. and c., of this ordinance will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by two (2) copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)	A fee in the amount of twenty dollars ($20.00) shall be charged for each application. In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-5-23(5)(a), provided that such fees shall not exceed eighty dollars ($80.00) per acre of land disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8(a), half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)	Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 5.2.3.c.(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection 5.2.4.b.(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)	If a permit applicant has had two (2) or more violations of previous permits, this ordinance section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three (3) years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)	The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  c.	Plan requirements. 
                  (1)	Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 5.2.3.b. and c. of this ordinance, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this ordinance. The plan for the land disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-20. 
                  (2)	Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  d.	Permits. 
                  (1)	Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than forty-five (45) days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)	No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this ordinance, any variances required by subsections 5.2.3.c.(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection 5.2.4.b.(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)	Any land disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this ordinance, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)	If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)	The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this ordinance. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)	The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two (2) or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three (3) years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. 12-7-7(f)(1).

                  Sec. 5.2.5. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  a.	The Joint Pulaski-Hawkinsville Building Department will periodically inspect the sites of land disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this ordinance, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this ordinance. 
                  b.	The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within twelve (12) months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  c.	The Joint Pulaski-Hawkinsville Building Department shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this ordinance, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land disturbing activities. 
                  d.	No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  e.	The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  f.	The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have ninety (90) days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within ninety (90) days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  Sec. 5.2.6. - Penalties and incentives. 
                  a.	Failure to obtain a permit for land disturbing activity. If any person commences any land disturbing activity requiring a land disturbing permit as prescribed in this ordinance without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  b.	Stop work orders. 
                  (1)	For the first and second violations of the provisions of this ordinance, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five (5) days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five (5) days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop work order requiring that land disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  (2)	For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop work order; and 
                  (3)	All stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  (4)	When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  c.	Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person.

                  DIVISION 3. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION 

                  Sec. 5.3.1. - Findings of fact. 
                  a.	The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  b.	These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damage. 
                  (Ord. of 5-10-96)
                  Sec. 5.3.2. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this division to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  a.	Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
                  b.	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  c.	Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
                  d.	Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
                  e.	Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
                  (Ord. of 5-10-96)
                  Sec. 5.3.3. - Objectives.

                  a.	Protect human life and health;
                  b.	Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
                  c.	Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  d.	Minimize prolonged business interruption;
                  e.	Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, and streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  f.	Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; and 
                  g.	Insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  Existing construction: Any structure for which the start of construction commenced before the effective date of the original ordinance from which this chapter derives. 
                  Flood or flooding: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the: 
                  a.	Overflow of inland or tidal waters;
                  b.	Unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.
                  Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM): An official map of a community, issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, where the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard have been defined as zone A. 
                  Flood insurance rate map (FIRM): An official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
                  Flood insurance study: The official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the flood boundary floodway map and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
                  Floodway: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
                  Floor: The top surface of an enclosed area in a building including basement, i.e., top of slab in concrete shall construction or top of wood flooring in wood frame construction. The term does not include the floor of garage used solely for parking vehicles.

                  DIVISION 7. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE PROTECTION[2] 

                  Footnotes: 
                  --- (2) --- 
                  Editor's note—Ord. No. 99-2, adopted March, 22, 1999, did not specifically amend the Code, hence; inclusion as §§ 5.7.1—5.7.5 was at the editor's discretion.

                  Sec. 5.7.1. - Short title, background and objectives. 
                  (a)	This division shall be known as the "Groundwater Protection Ordinance."
                  (b)	Background. Variable levels of recharge area protection can be based upon the State's hydrogeology (e.g., areas such as the Dougherty Plain where a major aquifer crops out would receive a relatively high degree of protection whereas other areas, such as the shale hills of northwest Georgia, would receive a lower degree of protection). Recharge area protection within the significant recharge areas would be further refined, based upon the local susceptibility or vulnerability to human induced pollution (e.g., high, medium, or low). The significant recharge areas have already been identified and mapped (about 22-23% of the State). Pollution susceptibility mapping is ongoing. Existing statutes are adequate for protecting the remaining recharge areas (about 77-78% of the State). 
                  (c)	Objectives. The objectives of this division are:
                  (1)	Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas; 
                  (2)	Protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development; and
                  (3)	Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality.

                  Sec. 5.7.3. - Determination of pollution susceptibility. 
                  Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium or low based on the Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map prepared by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. 
                  (Ord. No. 99-2, § 3, 3-22-99)
                  Sec. 5.7.4. - Definitions. 
                  When used in this division, the following words and phrases shall have the meaning given in this section: 
                  "Aquifer" means any stratum or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well. (Note: This is the same definition used in the Groundwater Use Act). 
                  "Drastic" means the standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in U. S. Environmental Protection Agency document EPA-600/2-87-035. (Note: The "DRASTIC" methodology is the most widely used technique for evaluating pollution susceptibility). 
                  "Pollution Susceptibility" means the relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharge, leaks, impoundment's, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area. 
                  "Pollution Susceptibility Maps" means maps of relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the Department of Natural Resources. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the State into areas having high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential. 
                  "Recharge Area" means any portion of the earth's surface, where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer. 
                  "Significant Recharge Areas" means those areas mapped by the Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology, soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contracts, geologic structure, the presence of karst, and potentiometric surfaces.

                  --- (3) --- 
                  Editor's note—Ord. No. 99-3, adopted March 22, 1999, did not specifically amend the Code, hence; inclusion as §§ 5.8.1—5.8.6 was at the editor's discretion.
                  State Law reference— Metropolitan River Protection Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-280 et seq.

                  Sec. 5.8.1. - Purpose. 
                  (a)	The River Corridor Protection District is an overlay district that applies additional standards of specific areas that may lie within any State of Georgia designated protected river corridor. In each zoning district located within the boundaries of the River Corridor Protection District, both the regulations of that district and the regulations of the River Corridor Protection District apply. If required development standards are specified for the same item in both districts, the more stringent governs. 
                  (b)	The purpose of this district is to protect certain river corridors that have been designated by the State of Georgia as Protected River Corridors because of their unique environmental importance. This district is intended to help maintain high water quality of these rivers. Other counties lying along these river corridors have adopted similar protective measures. In this manner, this State resource may be protected in a way that would not be possible by the uncoordinated action of an individual jurisdiction. 
                  (Ord. No. 99-3, § 1, 3-22-99)
                  Sec. 5.8.2. - Definitions. 
                  Hazardous waste means any solid waste which has been defined as a hazardous waste in regulations, promulgated by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the federal act, which are in force and effect on February 1, 1988, codified as 40 C.F.R. Section 261.3. (Note: This is the same definition as used in the Georgia Hazardous Waste Management Act.) 
                  Land disturbing activity means any grading, scraping, excavating, or filling of land; clearing of vegetation; and any construction, rebuilding, or alteration of a structure. Land disturbing activity shall not include activities such as ordinary maintenance and landscaping operations, individual home gardens, yard and grounds upkeep, repairs, additions or minor modifications to a single family dwelling, and the cutting of firewood for personal use. 
                  Land uses existing prior to the promulgation of a River Corridor Protection Plan means any land use or land disturbing activity, including all human endeavors directly associated with such use or activity, which, prior to the promulgation of the River Corridor Protection Plan falls within one of the following categories: 
                  1.	Is completed;
                  2.	Is under construction;
                  3.	Is fully approved by the governing authority;
                  4.	All materials have been submitted for approval by the governing authority; or
                  5.	Is zoned for such use and expenditures in excess of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) have been made in preparation for construction in accordance with such zoning. 
                  Local government means the governing authority of a political subdivision. 
                  Natural vegetative buffer or buffer area means a river corridor containing the flora native to that area. The natural floras for specific areas are described in Georgia Geologic Survey Bulletin 114, The Natural Environments of Georgia. Habitats for endangered and threatened species may require human management of the river corridor in order to maintain those species. 
                  Perennial river means a river or section of a river that flows continuously throughout the year. 
                  Plan or comprehensive plan means any plan by a county or municipality covering such county or municipality or any plan by a regional development center covering the center's region proposed or prepared pursuant to the minimum planning standards and procedures for preparation of comprehensive plans and for implementation of comprehensive plans, established by the Department of Community Affairs in accordance with O.C.G.A. §§ 50-8-1 through 50-8-12. (Note this is the same definition as used in O.C.G.A. § 50-8-2) 
                  Protected river means any perennial river or watercourse with an average annual flow of at least four hundred (400) cubic feet per second as determined by appropriate U.S. Geological Survey documents. 
                  Public utility or utilities means a service or services provided by a public utility company or a private entity which provides such service or services, and all equipment and structures necessary to provide such services. 
                  Quadrangle map means the most recently published U.S. Geological Survey 7.5 minute topographic map prepared at a scale of 1:24,000. 
                  River bank means the rising ground, bordering a river, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow. 
                  River corridor means all land, inclusive of islands, not regulated under the Metropolitan River Protection Act (O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-440 through 12-5-457), or the Coastal Marshland Protection Act (O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-280 through 12-5-293), in areas of a protected river and being within one hundred (100) feet horizontally on both sides of the river as measured from the river banks. The one hundred (100) foot buffer shall be measured horizontally from the uppermost part of the river bank, usually marked by a break in slope. Although not within the measured one hundred (100) foot wide buffer, the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river shall be treated by local governments in the same manner as the river corridor and shall be included within the River Corridor Protection Plan. Because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering, river bank erosion, and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time. For the purposes of these standards, the river corridor shall be considered to be fixed at its position at the beginning of each review period for local comprehensive plans. Any shift in the location of the protected river after the start of the review period will require a revision of the boundaries of the river corridor at the time of the next review by the Department of Community Affairs. 
                  River Corridor Protection Plan means that part of the local comprehensive plan which deals with the river corridor protection requirements specified herein. 
                  Sensitive natural areas means any area, as identified now or hereafter by the Department of Natural Resources, which contains one or more of the following: 
                  1.	Habitat, including nesting sites, occupied by rare or endangered species;
                  2.	Rare or exemplary natural communities;
                  3.	Significant landforms, hydroforms, or geological features; or
                  4.	Other areas so designated by the Department of Natural Resources; and which is sensitive or vulnerable to physical or biological alteration. 
                  Single-family dwelling means a dwelling structure that is designed for the use of one family. 
                  (Ord. No. 99-3, § 2, 3-22-99)
                  Sec. 5.8.3. - Boundaries of the River Corridor Protection District. 
                  The River Corridor Protection District consists of a natural vegetative buffer area extending one hundred (100) feet from the top of the riverbank on both sides of the Ocmulgee River as established by the State of Georgia. The top of the riverbank is defined as the uppermost part of the riverbank, usually marked by a break in the slope. All land that lies within this corridor is part of the River Corridor Protection District. The River Corridor Protection District is delineated on the Protected River Corridors Map, which is made a part of this Ordinance by reference, and is used to show the boundaries of the River Corridor Protection District.

                  (1)	Notification to the General Public.
                  (a)	At least fifteen (15) days but not more than forty-five (45) days prior to the public hearing, notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the city. The City Manager shall prepare such notice, which shall state the time, place and purpose of the hearing. 
                  (b)	A zoning change initiated by a party other than the Board of Commissioners or the Planning Commission shall be heard at a public hearing only upon: 
                  1.	The published notice, in addition to the requirements above, shall include the location of the property, the present zoning classification of the property, and the proposed zoning classification of the property or the conditional use requested; and 
                  2.	At least fifteen (15) days prior to the public hearing, the Applicant shall post, or have the City post at the Applicant's expense, a sign or signs of not less than twelve (12) square feet stating the date, time and place for the public hearing, the present zoning classification and the nature of the proposed zoning change. One such sign shall be placed in a conspicuous location along each street frontage of the property for which the zoning change has been requested. If the property has no street frontage, the sign shall be placed on each street from which access will be gained to the property. 
                  (2)	Notice to Surrounding Property Owners. If the proposed zoning change was initiated by a party other than the Board of Commissioners or the Planning Commission, or if it affects only one property, notice shall also be given to surrounding property owners as follows:

                  (b)	The notice shall state the time, place and purpose of the hearing by the Planning Commission and the date of the meeting of the Board of Commissioners. The written notice shall be mailed to the property owners as such names and addresses appear on the Pulaski County ad valorem tax records. 
                  b.	Planning Commission Public Hearing. The public hearing held by the Planning Commission for zoning changes shall be held within forty-five (45) days of receipt of a complete application. The public hearing shall be conducted in the following manner:

The presiding official may place reasonable limits on the number of persons who may speak for or against a proposal, on the time allowed for each speaker, and on the total time allowed for presentation of the proposed zoning change. No less than ten (10) minutes shall be provided for all of those speaking in support of a zoning change and no less than ten (10) minutes shall be provided for all of those speaking against, unless such proponents or opponents take less time than the minimum allowed. If reasonable time limitations permit, any member of the general public may speak at a hearing. However, the applicant and nearby property owners shall be afforded the first opportunity to speak. 
                  (4)	The applicant shall be allowed to speak first in order to present the application. Others may then speak, indicating first their support for or opposition to the application.

                  (5)	During the public hearing, the Planning Commission members may ask questions at any time. Time devoted to questions and answers will not be counted against any time limitations that have been imposed on presentations. 
                  (6)	Following the public hearing on each zoning change, the Planning Commission shall make its recommendation or take such other action as may be appropriate within thirty (30) days. 
                  (a)	A motion to recommend approval or denial of an application must be approved by an affirmative vote of at least three (3) members in order for the motion to be approved. 
                  (b)	If a motion to recommend approval of an application fails, the application is recommended for denial. If a motion to recommend denial of an application fails, another motion would be in order. 
                  (c)	A tie vote on a motion to recommend approval of an application shall be deemed a recommendation for denial of the application. A tie vote on any other motion shall be deemed to be no action, and another motion would be in order. 
                  c.	Board of Commissioners Meeting. 
                  (1)	The Board of Commissioners shall consider an application for a zoning change at their first scheduled meeting following receipt of the recommendation of the Planning Commission, or after thirty (30) days following the Planning Commission's public hearing on the application if no recommendation has been received. 
                  (2)	At the Board Of Commissioners' meeting when the proposed zoning change is scheduled to be considered, the Chairman or the Vice-Chairman shall act as Presiding Official. As each application for a zoning change is called for consideration, the City Manager shall read the recommendation of the Planning Commission and shall present such other documentation as he may deem pertinent.

                  (b)	If a motion to approve an application fails, the application is denied. If a motion to deny an application fails, another motion would be in order. 
                  (c)	A tie vote on a motion for approval of an application shall be deemed a denial of the application. A tie vote on any other motion shall be deemed to be no action, and another motion would be in order. 
                  (5)	In taking action on an application, the Board of Commissioners may:
                  (a)	Approve, approve with conditions, or reject the proposal; or,
                  (b)	Allow withdrawal if so requested by the applicant (with or without imposing a six month period during which another zoning change on the property may not be considered); or, 
                  (c)	Table the proposal for consideration at its next scheduled meeting.
                  (d)	Rezoning of Areas to be Annexed into the City. An area proposed for annexation into the city shall first be considered for rezoning prior to its annexation.

                  a.	Zoning Map Amendments (Rezoning). The Planning Commission and the Board of Commissioners shall consider the following standards in considering any zoning proposal that would result in a change in the boundary of a zoning district, giving due weight or priority to those factors that are appropriate to the circumstances of each proposal: 
                  (1)	Whether the proposal will permit a use that is suitable in view of the zoning and development of adjacent and nearby property. 
                  (2)	Whether the proposal will adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property. 
                  (3)	Whether the proposal is compatible with the purpose and intent of the Comprehensive Plan.

                  (5)	Whether the proposal will result in a use that will or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of public facilities or services, including but not limited to streets, schools, water or sewer utilities, and police or fire protection. 
                  (6)	Whether the proposal is supported by new or changing conditions not anticipated by the Comprehensive Plan or reflected in the existing zoning on the property or surrounding properties. 
                  (7)	Whether the proposal reflects a reasonable balance between the promotion of the public health, safety, morality or general welfare against the right to unrestricted use of property. 
                  b.	Conditional Uses. A conditional use otherwise permitted within a zoning district shall be considered to be compatible with other uses permitted in the district, provided that due consideration is given to the following objective criteria as applicable to the specific use proposed: 
                  (1)	The type of street providing access to the use is or will be adequate to serve the proposed Conditional Use. 
                  (2)	Access into and out of the property is or will be adequate to provide for traffic and pedestrian safety, the anticipated volume of traffic flow, and access by emergency vehicles. 
                  (3)	Refuse, service, parking, and loading areas on the property are or will be located or screened to protect other properties in the area from such adverse effects as noise, light, glare, or odor. 
                  (4)	The hours and manner of operation of the Condition Use has or will have no adverse effects on other properties in the area. 
                  (5)	The height, size, or location of the buildings or other structures on the property are or will be compatible with the height, size, or location of buildings or other structures on neighboring properties. 
                  c.	Change in Conditions of Approval. Any application that proposes a change in the conditions of approval previously established by the Board of Commissioners through action on a zoning change shall be reviewed in light of the standards set forth in this Section for a map amendment or conditional use, as appropriate. 
                  (Ord. of 5-10-96)

                  a.	If the request for withdrawal is received prior to the publication of notice for the public hearing, the application shall be withdrawn administratively by the City Manager without restriction on the refiling of a proposed zoning change on the property in the future. 
                  b.	If notice has been published (or is irretrievably set for publication) but the application has not been heard by the Board of Commissioners, the application shall be withdrawn administratively by the City Manager, and an application for a zoning change on the property may not be resubmitted for six (6) months from the date of withdrawal.

If denied, an application for a special exception affecting the same property shall not be reconsidered for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of denial; provided, however, that the Board of Commissioners may reduce the waiting period under extenuating circumstances or on its own motion.
