         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of Bleckley County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the resolutions and ordinances adopted by the Bleckley County Sole Commissioner. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any resolution or ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation that represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Sandra S. Fox, Code Attorney, and Beth Tattershall, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

                  The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code and are considered "Included."

                  --- (1) --- 
                  Editor's note— Part I contains portions of selected state laws of local application as requested by the county. Amendments to the original acts are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a subsequent history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original act. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. The title, enactment, severability, repealer, transitional, ratification, publication and effective date provisions have been omitted, and where a section has been amended or repealed by a later provision, only the current language has been printed. Unless otherwise noted, section numbers and catchlines have been supplied by the editor. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. Formal citations should be to the original act and not to this compilation.

The Authority may execute any trust agreement or indenture not in conflict with the provisions of this amendment to provide security for any bonds issued as provided herein, and such trust agreement or indenture may provide for foreclosure or forced sale of any property of the Authority upon default on such bonds either in payment of principal or interest or under any term or condition under which such bonds are issued. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to create a right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of Bleckley County or the City of Cochran to pay any of the said obligations of said Authority.

               <head>Chapter 6 - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT </head>
               <p>                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 6-1. - Purpose and intent. 
                  (a)  Based on the experiences of other urban counties and municipalities, including but not limited to Atlanta, College Park, Carrolton, Whitfield County, Georgia, which experiences are relevant to the problems faced by the county, the county takes note of the well-known and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable counties in the state. 
                  (b)  Moreover, it is the finding of the sole commissioner that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment," leads to an increase in the surrounding area of criminal behavior and creates undesirable community conditions, blight and diminution in property values. In the same manner, establishments offering photographic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the county. 
                  (c)  Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, live commercial nudity in general, and photographic adult entertainment are disorderly conduct, prostitution, solicitation, drug trafficking, drug use and corruption of public officials. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and photographic adult entertainment are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior described in this subsection. 
                  (d)  Furthermore, it is the finding of the sole commissioner that other forms of adult entertainment including, but not limited to, adult bookstores, peep shows, adult theaters and massage parlors, have a deleterious effect upon the quality of life in neighborhoods, commercial districts and urban life in general. 
                  (e)  The county has declared that it is in the best interests of the public health, welfare, safety and morals of the county to reduce the adverse impact of adult entertainment facilities by limiting the number of such uses, so as to reduce the negative impacts of adult entertainment facilities or adult uses upon other business uses, neighborhood property values, residential areas and public and semipublic uses; to ensure that adult uses and adult entertainment facilities do not impede development, redevelopment and neighborhood revitalization efforts; and so as to avoid allowing adult entertainment and adult uses in heavily used public pedestrian areas. 
                  (f)  The county further declares that nudity and sexually explicit entertainment coupled with alcohol in public places encourages undesirable behavior and is not in the interest of public health, safety, and welfare. 
                  (g)  Therefore, the limitation of adult uses and adult entertainment to certain prescribed areas of the county is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to minimize the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which provide or establish adult entertainment or adult uses.

                  The county wishes to control the sale and consumption of malt beverages and wine within its limits and to find additional sources of revenue in order to forestall any tax increase on the people of the county.

Therefore, the county will issue wholesale and retail licenses for the sale of malt beverages and wine within the unincorporated areas of said county, subject at all times to regulations and controls to be established by the sole commissioner as set forth in this article and by state law.

                  Sec. 14-79. - Conditions of permit. 
                  (a)  Intent of permit. A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not as authority to violate, cancel, alter, or set aside any of the provisions of the technical codes, nor shall issuance of a permit prevent the building official from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction, or violations of this chapter. Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is commenced within six months after its issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of six months after the time the worked is commenced. One or more extensions of time, for periods not more than 90 days each, may be allowed for the permit. The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated. Extensions shall be in writing by the building official. 
                  (b)  Permit issued on affidavit. Whenever a permit is issued in reliance upon an affidavit or whenever the work to be covered by a permit involves installation under conditions which, in the opinion of the building official, are hazardous or complex, the building official shall require that the architect or engineer who signed the affidavit or prepared the drawings or computations shall supervise such work. In addition, the architect or engineer shall be responsible for conformity with the permit, provide copies of inspection reports as inspections are performed, and upon completion make and file with the building official a written affidavit that the work has been done in conformity with the reviewed plans and with the structural provisions of the technical codes. In the event such architect or engineer is not available, the owner shall employ in his stead a competent person or agency whose qualifications are reviewed by the building official. 
                  (c)  Plans. When the building official issues a permit, he shall endorse, in writing or by stamp, both sets of plans "Reviewed for Code Compliance." One set of drawings so reviewed shall be retained by the building official and the other set shall be returned to the applicant. The permitted drawings shall be kept at the site of work and shall be open to inspection by the building official or his authorized representative.

                  Sec. 14-80. - Fees. 
                  (a)  Payment. A permit shall not be issued until the fees prescribed in subsection (d) of this section have been paid, nor shall an amendment to a permit be released until the additional fee, if any, due to an increase in the estimated cost of the building, structure, or electrical, plumbing, mechanical or gas systems, has been paid. 
                  (b)  Work started before permit issuance. Any person who commences any work on a building, structure, or electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system before obtaining the necessary permit, shall be subject to a penalty of 100 percent of the usual permit fee in addition to the required permit fees. 
                  (c)  Accounting. The building official shall keep a permanent and accurate accounting of all permit fees and other monies collected, the names of all persons upon whose account the same was paid, along with the date and amount thereof. 
                  (d)  Schedule of permit fees. On all buildings, structures, electrical, plumbing, mechanical and gas systems or alterations requiring a permit, a fee for each permit shall be paid as required at the time of filing application, in accordance with the schedule as established by the sole commissioner.

                  Sec. 14-82. - Certificates of occupancy. 
                  (a)  Required for occupancy. A new building shall not be occupied or a change made in the occupancy, nature or use of a building or part of a building until after the building official has issued a certificate of occupancy. Said certificate shall not be issued until all required electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing and fire protection systems have been inspected for compliance with the technical codes and other applicable laws and ordinances and released by the building official. 
                  (b)  Issuance of certificate of occupancy. Upon satisfactory completion of construction of a building or structure and installation of electrical, gas, mechanical and plumbing systems in accordance with the technical codes, reviewed plans and specifications, and after the final inspection, the building official shall issue a certificate of occupancy stating the nature of the occupancy permitted, the number of persons for each floor when limited by law, and the allowable load per square foot for each floor in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
                  (c)  Temporary or partial occupancy. A temporary or partial certificate of occupancy may be issued for a portion of a building that may safely be occupied prior to final completion of the building. 
                  (d)  Existing building certificate of occupancy.

                  Sec. 14-83. - Certificates of completion. 
                  (a)  Issuance. Upon satisfactory completion of a building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system, a certificate of completion may be issued. This certificate is proof that a structure or system is complete and for certain types of permits is released for use and may be connected to a utility system. This certificate does not grant authority to occupy or connect a building, such as a shell building, prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
                  (b)  Service utilities; connections. No person shall make connections from a utility, source of energy, fuel or power to any building or system that is regulated by the technical codes for which a permit is required, until released by the building official and a certificate of occupancy or completion is issued. 
                  (1)  Temporary connection. The building official may authorize the temporary connection of the building or system to the utility source of energy, fuel or power for the purpose of testing building service systems or for use under a temporary certificate of occupancy. 
                  (2)  Authority to disconnect service utilities. The building official shall have the authority to authorize disconnection of utility service to the building, structure or system regulated by the technical codes, in case of emergency, where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to life or property. The building official shall notify the serving utility, and whenever possible the owner and occupant of the building, structure or service system, of the decision to disconnect prior to taking such action. If not notified prior to disconnecting, the owner or occupant of the building, structure or service system shall be notified in writing, as soon as practical thereafter.

                  Sec. 14-84. - Posting floor loads. 
                  (a)  Occupancy. An existing or new building shall not be occupied for any purpose that will cause the floors thereof to be loaded beyond their safe capacity. The building official may permit occupancy of a building for mercantile, commercial or industrial purposes, by a specific business, when he is satisfied that such capacity will not thereby be exceeded. 
                  (b)  Storage and factory-industrial occupancies. It shall be the responsibility of the owner, agent, proprietor or occupant of group S and group F occupancies, or any occupancy where excessive floor loading is likely to occur, to employ a competent architect or engineer in computing the safe load capacity. All such computations shall be accompanied by an affidavit from the architect or engineer stating the safe allowable floor load on each floor in pounds per square foot uniformly distributed. The computations and affidavit shall be filed as a permanent record of the building department. 
                  (c)  Signs required. In every building or part of a building used for storage, industrial or hazardous purposes, the safe floor loads, as reviewed by the building official on the plan, shall be marked on plates of approved design which shall be supplied and securely affixed by the owner of the building in a conspicuous place in each story to which they relate. Such plates shall not be removed or defaced, and if lost, removed or defaced, shall be replaced by the owner of the building.

The two alternates, if appointed, shall serve one-year terms. Vacancies shall be filled for an unexpired term in the manner in which original appointments are required to be made. Continued absence of any member from required meetings of the board shall, at the discretion of the sole commissioner, render any such member subject to immediate removal from office. 
                  (c)  Quorum and voting. A simple majority of the board shall constitute a quorum. In varying any provision of this chapter, the affirmative votes of the majority present, but not less than three affirmative votes, shall be required. In modifying a decision of the building official, not less than four affirmative votes, but not less than a majority of the board, shall be required. In the event that regular members are unable to attend a meeting, the alternate members, if appointed, shall vote. 
                  (d)  Secretary of board. The building official shall act as secretary of the board and shall make a detailed record of all its proceedings that shall set forth the reasons for its decision, the vote of each member, the absence of a member and any failure of a member to vote.

                  Sec. 14-114. - Powers. 
                  The construction board of adjustments and appeals shall have the power, as further defined in section 14-115, to hear the appeals of decisions and interpretations of the building official and consider variances to the technical codes. 
                  (Res. of 6-20-1986(1), § 5.3) 
                  Sec. 14-115. - Appeals. 
                  (a)  Decision of the building official. The owner of a building, structure or service system, or his duly authorized agent, may appeal a decision of the building official to the construction board of adjustments and appeals whenever any one of the following conditions are claimed to exist: 
                  (1)  The building official rejected or refused to approve the mode or manner of construction proposed to be followed or materials to be used in the installation or alteration of a building, structure or service system. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this chapter do not apply to this specific case. 
                  (3)  That an equally good or more desirable form of installation can be employed in any specific case. 
                  (4)  The true intent and meaning of this chapter or any of the regulations hereunder have been misconstrued or incorrectly interpreted. 
                  (b)  Variances. The construction board of adjustments and appeals, when so appealed to and after a hearing, may vary the application of any provision of this chapter to any particular case when, in its opinion, the enforcement thereof would do manifest injustice and would be contrary to the spirit and purpose of this chapter, the technical codes or public interest, and also finds all of the following: 
                  (1)  That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the building, structure or service system involved and which are not applicable to others. 
                  (2)  That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the action or inaction of the applicant. 
                  (3)  That granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other buildings, structures or service systems. 
                  (4)  That the variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the building, structure or service system. 
                  (5)  That the grant of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of this chapter and will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (c)  Conditions of the variance. In granting the variance, the board may prescribe a reasonable time limit within which the action for which the variance is required shall be commenced or completed, or both. In addition, the board may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter. Violation of the conditions of a variance shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. 
                  (d)  Notice of appeal. Notice of appeal shall be in writing and filed within 30 calendar days after the decision is rendered by the building official. Appeals shall be in a form acceptable to the building official. 
                  (e)  Unsafe or dangerous buildings or service systems. In the case of a building, structure, or service system that, in the opinion of the building official, is unsafe, unsanitary or dangerous, the building official may, in his order, limit the time for such appeals to a shorter period.

                  Sec. 14-116. - Rules and regulations. 
                  (a)  Established by board. The construction board of adjustment and appeals shall establish rules and regulations for its own procedure not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter. The board shall meet on call from the chairman. The board shall meet within 30 calendar days after notice of appeal has been received. 
                  (b)  Decisions of the board. The construction board of adjustments and appeals shall, in every case, reach a decision without unreasonable or unnecessary delay. Each decision of the board shall also include the reasons for the decision. If a decision of the board reverses or modifies a refusal, order, or disallowance of the building official or varies the application of any provision of this chapter, the building official shall immediately take action in accordance with such decision. Every decision shall be promptly filed in writing in the office of the building official and shall be open to public inspection. A certified copy of the decision shall be sent by mail or otherwise to the appellant and a copy shall be kept publicly posted in the office of the building official for two weeks after filing. Every decision of the board shall be final; subject, however, to such remedy as any aggrieved party might have at law or in equity.

                  Sec. 22-19. - Purpose and intent. 
                  (a)  The governing authorities of the county and the City of Cochran, Georgia, find it necessary, desirable, and in the public interest to establish a formal process for resolving land use disputes as they relate to property annexation and land use plans. 
                  (b)  In this article, the City of Cochran is referred to interchangeably as the "city" or the "municipality," and the County of Bleckley, Georgia, is referred to as the "county." 
                  (Res. of 5-21-1998) 
                  Sec. 22-20. - Procedure. 
                  (a)  Prior to initiating any formal annexation activities, the municipality will notify the county of a proposed annexation and provide information on location of property, size of area, and proposed land use or zoning classification, if applicable, of the property. 
                  (b)  Within 30 days following receipt of the information required in subsection (a) of this section, the county will forward to the city a statement indicating that the county has no objection to the proposed land use for the property or describing its bona fide objection to the city's proposed land use classification, providing supporting evidence, and listing any possible stipulations or conditions that would alleviate the county's objections. 
                  (c)  If the county has no objection to the city's proposed land use or zoning classification, the city is free to proceed with the annexation. If the county fails to respond to the city's notice in writing within the deadline, the city is free to proceed with the annexation and the county loses its right to invoke the dispute resolution process, or object to land use changes after the annexation. 
                  (d)  If the county notifies the city that it has bona fide land use classification objections, the city will respond to the county in writing within 30 days of receiving the county's objections by either: 
                  (1)  Agreeing to implement the county's stipulations and conditions, thereby resolving the county's objection; 
                  (2)  Agreeing with the county and stopping action on the proposed annexation; or 
                  (3)  Disagreeing that the county's objections are bona fide, in which event the city will initiate a joint meeting of the respective governments to resolve the issue. 
                  (e)  If the city initiates mediation, the city and the county will agree on a mediator, mediation schedule and determine participants on the mediation. The city and county agree to share equally any costs associated with the mediation. 
                  (f)  An annexation proposal shall not be effective until any bona fide land use classification objections raised by the county are resolved pursuant to the dispute resolution process. 
                  (g)  The final resolution of any recommendation of a land use classification will be accorded to the governing body considering the annexation. In cases of land use disputes not related to annexation proposals, the final resolution of a land use dispute will be accorded to the jurisdiction in which the subject property is located. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, a government may seek declaratory judgment in a court of proper jurisdiction pursuant to a land use decision.

                  (a)  The governing authorities of the county and the cities of Allentown, Georgia, and Cochran, Georgia, have found it necessary, desirable, and in the public interest to establish a formal process to ensure the provision of extraterritorial water and sewer service consistent with applicable land use plans and ordinances so as to meet the requirements of law and act in a spirit of cooperation and coordination. 
                  (b)  In this article, the cities of Allentown and Cochran are referred to as "the city" or "the cities" and Bleckley County is referred to as "the county."

                  Sec. 22-45. - Procedure. 
                  (a)  Prior to initiating any extensions of water or sewer services outside the boundaries of that respective local government, the city seeking such an extension will notify the county government of the proposed extension. The notification will provide information on the location of the property, the size of the proposed extension, the proposed purpose of the extension (i.e., proposed change in land use), and the existing land use classification of the property. Official notification of the county as required by this agreement shall be achieved by delivery of the required information to the county clerk. 
                  (b)  Within 30 working days following receipt of the information required in subsection (a) of this section, the county will forward to the city proposing the extension a statement: 
                  (1)  Indicating that the proposed extraterritorial water or sewer extension is deemed compatible with the county's land use plan and all applicable ordinances and that the county has no objection to the proposal; or 
                  (2)  Describing its bona fide objections to the proposed water or sewer extension stating why the proposal is incompatible with the land use plan or ordinances, and providing supporting information including a listing of any possible stipulations or conditions that would alleviate the county's objections. 
                  (c)  If the county has no objection, or fails to respond within 30 working days, to the city's proposed extraterritorial water or sewer extension, the city is free to proceed with the provision of the service. 
                  (d)  If the county notifies the city that it has a bona fide objection, the city will respond to the county in writing within 30 working days by either: 
                  (1)  Agreeing with the county and stopping action on the proposed extraterritorial water or sewer service extension; 
                  (2)  Agreeing to implement the county's stipulations and conditions, thereby resolving the county's objection; 
                  (3)  Requesting a meeting and informal resolution of the issues, including discussing a formal change, of necessary to the land use plan; 
                  (4)  Disagreeing that the county's objection is bona fide and asking for county reconsideration, or requesting a meeting and informal resolution. 
                  (e)  If the informal dispute resolution process does not result in agreement, the city or county may initiate a formal mediation process. If the city and county reach agreement through the informal resolution process, the city is free to proceed with the extraterritorial service extension as agreed. 
                  (f)  In the event the respective jurisdictions seek mediation, the governments will agree on a mediator and a mediation schedule and determine participants in the mediation. The city and county shall share equally any costs associated with mediation. 
                  (g)  A proposal to extend extraterritorial water and sewer service shall not be implemented until any bona fide land use or land use ordinance inconsistencies are resolved pursuant to the dispute resolution process, or have been taken to mediation. 
                  (h)  If no resolution of the county's objection occurs even after mediation, the city may drop the proposal and not proceed with the extension or take court action to obtain a declaratory judgment or otherwise take appropriate action that would lawfully allow the extension. 
                  (i)  The final determination of the compatibility of the proposed extension with the land use plan or land use ordinances will be accorded to the governing body receiving the proposed service extension, unless court action determines that the county's objection is not bona fide and a declaratory judgment is obtained. 
                  (j)  This extraterritorial process for water and sewer services shall remain in force and effect until amended or terminated by operation of law.

                  --- (1) --- 
                  Editor's note— Ord. of 6-13-2012 was not specifically amendatory, at the editor's discretion those provisions have been included as §§ 26-1—26-6. 

                  Sec. 26-1. - Regulations continued in effect. 
                  All ordinances, resolutions, motions and orders pertaining to civil defense, emergency management and disaster relief, which are not in conflict with this chapter, are continued in full force and effect. Such ordinances, etc., are on file in the office of the county commissioner. 
                  (Ord. of 6-13-2012, § 1) 
                  Sec. 26-2. - Emergency management and response powers. 
                  (a)  Declaration of local emergency. 
                  (1)  Grant of authority. In the event of an actual or threatened occurrence of a disaster or emergency, which may result in the large-scale loss of life, injury, property damage or destruction or in the major disruption of routine community affairs, business or governmental operations in the county and which is of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant extraordinary assistance by federal, state and local departments and agencies to supplement the efforts of available public and private resources, the county commissioner may declare a local emergency for the county. The form of the declaration shall be similar to that provided in subsection (b). 
                  (2)  Request for state assistance. Consistent with a declaration of local emergency, the county commissioner may request the governor to provide assistance, provided that the disaster or emergency is beyond the capacity of the county to meet adequately and state assistance is necessary to supplement local efforts to save lives and protect property, public health and safety, or to avert or lessen the threat of a disaster. 
                  (3)  Continuance. The declaration of local emergency shall continue until the county commissioner finds that emergency conditions no longer exist, at which time, the commissioner shall execute and file with the clerk of the county commissioner a document marking the end of the state of emergency. No state of local emergency shall continue longer than 30 days, unless renewed by the commissioner. The commissioner may, by resolution, end a state of local emergency at any time. 
                  (4)  Effect of declaration of emergency. 
                  a.  Activation of emergency operations plan. A declaration of emergency by the governor or a declaration of local emergency by the commissioner shall automatically activate the county emergency operations plan and shall be the authority for deployment of personnel and use of any forces to which the plan applies and for use or distribution of any supplies, equipment, materials, and facilities assembled, stockpiled or arranged to be made available pursuant to the state's emergency management act or any other laws applicable to emergencies or disasters. 
                  1.  The Cochran-Bleckley Emergency Management Agency ("EMA") Director shall have the legal authority to exercise the powers and discharge the duties conferred upon the emergency management agency, including the implementation of the emergency operations plan, coordination of the emergency responses of public and private agencies and organizations, coordination of recovery efforts with state and federal officials, and inspection of emergency or disaster sites. 
                  2.  In responding and conducting necessary and appropriate investigations, the director or his/her designee is authorized to enter at a reasonable time upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigating and inspecting sites involved with emergency management functions. The director is authorized to execute a right of entry and/or agreement to use property for these purposes on behalf of the county; however, any such document shall be later presented for ratification at a meeting of the county commissioner. 
                  3.  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the county who requests entry for purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials. Nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while that individual is in the process of carrying out his or her official duties. 
                  b.  Emergency powers. Following a declaration of emergency and during the continuance of such state of emergency, the commissioner is authorized to implement local emergency measures to protect life and property or to bring the emergency situation under control. In exercising this authority, the commissioner may cause to become effective any of the following sections of this chapter as appropriate: section 26-5 (registration of building and repair services) to become effective if the governor declares a state of emergency; and section 26-6 (closed or restricted areas and curfews). If any of these sections are included in a declaration of local emergency, the same shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the county commissioner and shall be in effect until the declaration of local emergency has terminated. 
                  c.  Authority to waive procedures and fees. Pursuant to a declaration of emergency, the county commissioner is authorized to cause to be effective any of the subsections of section 26-4 of this chapter as appropriate. The implementation of such subsections shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the county commissioner. 
                  d.  Additional emergency powers. The county commissioner shall have, and may exercise for such period as the declared emergency exists or continues, the following additional emergency powers: 
                  1.  To direct and compel the evacuation of all or part of the population from any stricken or threatened area, for the preservation of life or other disaster mitigation, response or recovery; 
                  2.  To prescribe routes, modes of transportation and destinations in connection with evacuation; 
                  3.  To suspend or limit the sale, dispensing or transportation of alcoholic beverages, firearms, explosives and flammable liquids and substances;

                  6.  To utilize all available resources of the county and subordinate agencies over which the county has budgetary control as reasonably necessary to cope with the emergency or disaster; 
                  7.  To utilize public property when necessary to cope with the emergency or disaster or when there is compelling necessity for the protection of lives, health and welfare; and/or the property of citizens; 
                  8.  To suspend any law, code provision or regulation prescribing the procedures for conduct of county business, or the orders, rules or regulations of any county agency, if strict compliance with any ordinance, resolution, order, rule or regulation would in any way prevent, hinder or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency or disaster, provided that such suspension shall provide for the minimum deviation from the requirements under the circumstances and further provided that, when practicable, specialists shall be assigned to avoid adverse effects resulting from such suspension; 
                  9.  To provide benefits to citizens upon execution of an intergovernmental agreement for grants to meet disaster-related necessary expenses or serious needs of individuals or families adversely affected by an emergency or disaster in cases where the individuals or families are unable to meet the expenses or needs from other means, provided that such grants are authorized only when matching state or federal funds are available for such purposes; 
                  10.  To perform and exercise such other functions, powers and duties as may be deemed necessary to promote and secure the safety and protection of the civilian population, including individuals with household pets and service animals prior to, during and following a major disaster or emergency. 
                  (b)  Form of declaration of local emergency. Upon the declaration of local emergency, an official "declaration of local emergency," in substantially the same form set forth below, shall be signed and filed in the office of the county clerk and shall be communicated to the citizens of the affected area using the most effective and efficient means available. The declaration shall state the nature of the emergency or disaster, the conditions that require the declaration and any sections of this chapter which shall be in effect.

                  (3)  That the following measures also be implemented: [If deemed appropriate, select items from section 26-2(a)(4)c. or d. or such other measures as appropriate.]

                  Sole Commissioner, Bleckley County Ga.

                  (Ord. of 6-13-2012, § 2) 
                  Sec. 26-3. - Enforcement and remedies. 
                  (a)  Law enforcement. In accordance with O.C.G.A. § 38-3-4, the county sheriff's office shall be authorized to enforce the orders, rules and regulations contained in this chapter and/or implemented by the commissioner or local governing authority during a declared emergency. 
                  (b)  Penalties. Failure to comply with any of the requirements or provisions of the regulations contained in this chapter, or with any code section, order, rule or regulation made effective by the commissioner or local governing authority upon or after the declaration of an emergency shall constitute a violation of the provisions of this chapter. Any person who violates any provision in this chapter shall, upon conviction thereof, be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not exceeding $1,000.00, imprisonment for a term not exceeding 60 days, or both such fine and imprisonment, for each violation. Each person assisting in the commission of a violation shall be guilty of separate offenses. Each day during which a violation or failure to comply continues shall constitute a separate violation.

In accordance with O.C.G.A. § 38-3-5, in addition to the remedies prescribed in this section, the EMA director is authorized to obtain an injunction to restrain violation of laws, code sections, orders, rules and regulations which are contained in the state's emergency management act and/or this code, and/or which are implemented by the local governing authority during a declared emergency. 
                  (d)  Enforcement. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, this article may be enforced by the sheriff's office, the EMA director, and the county commissioner. 
                  (Ord. of 6-13-2012, § 3) 
                  Sec. 26-4. - Authority to waive procedures and fee structures. 
                  (a)  County business. Upon declaration of an emergency or disaster by the governor or county commissioner, the affairs and business of the county may be conducted at places other than the regular or usual location, within or outside of the county, when it is not prudent, expedient or possible to conduct business at the regular location. When such meetings occur outside of the county, all actions taken by the commissioner shall be as valid and binding as if performed within the county. Such meetings may be called by the presiding officer or any two members of the governing body without regard to or compliance with time-consuming procedures and formalities otherwise required by law. 
                  Note— Local legislation should be reviewed to determine whether there are restrictions upon moving the meeting location if it is only a locally declared emergency and not a state of emergency declared by the governor. 
                  (b)  Public works contracts. Upon declaration of an emergency or disaster by the governor or county commissioner, the commissioner may contract for public works without letting such contract out to the lowest, responsible bidder and without advertising and posting notification of such contract for four weeks; provided, however, that the emergency must be of such nature that immediate action is required and that the action is necessary for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare. Any public works contract entered into pursuant to this subsection shall be entered on the minutes of the county as soon as practical and the nature of the emergency described therein in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 36-91-22(e). 
                  (c)  Purchasing. Upon declaration of an emergency or disaster by the governor or county commissioner, the purchasing ordinances, regulations or policies may be suspended. County officials shall continue to seek to obtain the best prices during the state of local emergency. 
                  (d)  Code enforcement. Upon declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor or the county commissioner, the commissioner may temporarily suspend the enforcement of the ordinances of the county, or any portion thereof, where the emergency is of such nature that immediate action outside the code is required, such suspension is consistent with the protection of the public health, safety and welfare, and such suspension is not inconsistent with any federal or state statutes or regulations. 
                  (e)  Fees. Upon declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor or the county commissioner, the county commissioner may temporarily reduce or suspend any permit fees, application fees or other rate structures as necessary to encourage the rebuilding of the areas impacted by the disaster or emergency. The term "fees" include fees or rates charged by the county for building permits, land disturbance permits, zoning applications, special land use permits, temporary land use permits and other fees relating to the reconstruction, repair and clean up of areas impacted by the disaster or emergency. The term "fees" does not include fees collected by the county on behalf of the state or federal government or fees charged by the county pursuant to a state or federal statute or regulation. 
                  (f)  Temporary dwellings. Upon the declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor or county commissioner, the commissioner or its designees may issue temporary mobile home, trailer, recreational vehicle or other temporary dwelling structures or parks in any zoning district, even though not otherwise permitted by development code, while the primary dwelling is being repaired, provided that such temporary dwellings or parks are designed by an engineer and the plans are approved by the county health department and development services. The temporary permit shall not exceed six months in duration. In the case of a continuing hardship, and in the discretion of the commissioner or its designee, the permit may be extended for a period of up to an additional six months. Upon expiration of the temporary permit and/or extension, the temporary dwelling must be removed.

                  Sec. 26-5. - Registration of building and repair services. 
                  (a)  In accordance with O.C.G.A. § 38-3-56, before building, constructing, repairing, renovating or making improvements to any real property, including dwellings, homes, buildings, structures or fixtures within an area in the unincorporated area of the county designated in a declared emergency or disaster, any person, firm, partnership, corporation or other entity must register with the local county development services department and secure a building permit that is posted at the work site. Each day any such entity does business in the unincorporated areas of the county without complying with this article constitutes a separate offense. 
                  (b)  The cost of registration fees in a declared emergency or disaster is fixed at $100.00 per annum. Registration is nontransferable.

                  Sec. 30-1. - Wetlands protection. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. The wetlands within the county are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; open space; and recreational opportunities. 
                  (b)  Reference map. The official maps to be used as the determinant for location of wetlands in the county and areas to be regulated under this article will be the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Wetlands Inventory Map for the county. 
                  (c)  Wetlands development permit requirements. No activity or use except those identified herein shall be allowed within wetlands areas without a permit under this article. If there appear to be wetlands on any site under consideration for a permit that any proposed development may disturb and which appears to be under the jurisdiction of section 404, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' determination shall be required. No local permit will be issued until the person requesting the permit at their own expense obtains a section 404 permit or letter of permission from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. If the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determines there are no jurisdictional wetlands involved, this determination will take precedence over the National Wetlands Inventory Map and the permit issuance under the provisions of this article may proceed as if no wetland areas are involved. 
                  (d)  Permitted uses not requiring a permit. The following uses are permitted without permit within the wetlands of the county to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein: 
                  (1)  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission. (Section 404 does not require permits for normal, ongoing silvicultural activities. However, section 404 does list some required road construction best management practices that must be followed in order to qualify for such an exemption.) 
                  (2)  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, or other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual section 404 permit. 
                  (3)  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, birdwatching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing. 
                  (4)  Natural water quality treatment or purification. 
                  (5)  Normal agricultural activities, including the planting and harvesting of crops and pasturing of livestock. Such activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture. 
                  (e)  Prohibited uses. In compliance with the Georgia Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria, the following uses are prohibited entirely and no permit shall be issued for them: 
                  (1)  Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants. 
                  (2)  Hazardous sanitary landfills. 
                  (Ord. of 10-21-1999(2), §§ 6.1—6.5) 
                  Sec. 30-2. - Groundwater recharge area protection. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides and herbicides sprayed on crops and animal waste, like septic tank affluents, contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies. 
                  (b)  Reference map. The official map for delineation of significant groundwater recharge areas in the county to be regulated areas under this article is the state department of natural resources' Significant Recharge Areas, Hydrological Atlas 18 (1989 edition). 
                  (c)  Groundwater recharge areas development permit requirements. All new uses except those identified in this article and those subject to further restriction by any underlying zoning district are allowed. The following are additional requirements for specific uses: 
                  (1)  All new aboveground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660 gallons, shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks, and shall otherwise meet the requirements of the rules of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for oil pollution prevention, 40 CFR 112. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt, provided that they comply with all federal requirements. 
                  (2)  All new single-family dwellings, multifamily dwellings, mobile home parks, or other uses located within the county and not served by both public water and sewer systems shall be required to have a minimum lot or space size at least 150 percent of normal requirements of the state department of human resources according to its Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems, but said minimum lot or space size shall not be in any case less than the minimum lot or space size specified by any underlying zoning district. The regulations specifying the largest minimum lot or space size shall apply. 
                  (3)  All lots shall have a minimum width of 150 feet, or as specified in any underlying zoning district if stricter (larger), in the area where an approved on-site sewage management system is to be located. 
                  (4)  All new wastewater treatment basins shall have an impermeable liner except for the construction of mining settling basins. 
                  (5)  All new agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined. As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compact clay having a thickness of one foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 x 10 -7 cm/sec or other criteria established by the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service. 
                  (d)  Prohibited uses. The following uses are prohibited entirely and no permit shall be issued for them: 
                  (1)  All hazardous waste storage, treatment and disposal facilities, and those facilities handling 10,000 pounds or more of hazardous materials of the types listed in section 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, 42 USC 6901 et seq., as amended, excluding underground storage tanks, on any one day. 
                  (2)  Permanent stormwater infiltration basins. 
                  (Ord. of 10-21-1999(2), §§ 7.1—7.4) 
                  Sec. 30-3. - Major river corridor protection. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. Perennial rivers or watercourses with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second are of vital importance to the state in that they help preserve those qualities that make a river suitable for habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source for clean drinking water. These river corridors also allow the free movement of wildlife from area to area within the state, help control erosion and river sedimentation, and help absorb floodwaters. 
                  (b)  District delineation. Protected rivers, as defined under the Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria, adopted by the state department of natural resources pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, include any perennial river or watercourses with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second. The Ocmulgee River through the county meets this criteria. A protective 100-foot vegetation buffer is hereby established along this river. The buffer area is measured horizontally from each riverbank within the county jurisdiction. Under the method prescribed by the Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria, no development or other land disturbing activity will be allowed to occur within a 100-foot buffer of the riverbank except for the permitted uses in subsection (c) of this section. 
                  (c)  Permitted uses. No development, construction, or other land disturbing activity will be allowed to occur within the 100-foot buffer from the protected river except for the following uses, and the natural vegetative buffer shall be restored as quickly as possible following any land disturbing activity or construction permitted within the river corridor for these acceptable uses. 
                  (1)  Single-family dwellings, if any underlying zoning district so permits, provided each dwelling is located on a lot with a minimum size as specified by the county health department or the underlying zoning district regulations, but shall be the greater of these requirements; however, in any case the lot for each dwelling shall not be less than two acres, not including any area between the river banks; and provided the septic tank drainfield is located outside of the 100-foot buffer area. 
                  (2)  Any industrial or commercial uses existing prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived, providing they do not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the Federal Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1251 et seq., as amended, and meet all other federal and state environmental regulations. 
                  (3)  Road and utility crossings, providing the construction of these crossings meets the requirements of the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq., as amended, or any local requirements, if stricter. 
                  (4)  Timber production and harvesting, providing it is consistent with the best management practices established by the state forestry commission, and does not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the Federal Clean Water Act, as amended. 
                  (5)  Agricultural production and management, provided it is consistent with the best management practices established by the state soil and water conservation commission, and all other state and federal regulations; and does not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the Federal Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1251 et seq., as amended. 
                  (6)  Wildlife and fisheries management activities consistent with the purposes of O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8. 
                  (7)  Natural water quality treatment or purification. 
                  (8)  Wastewater treatment. 
                  (9)  Recreational usage consistent with the maintenance of a natural vegetative buffer or with river-dependent recreation. 
                  (d)  Prohibited uses. In compliance with the Georgia Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria, the following uses are prohibited entirely and no permit shall be issued for them: 
                  (1)  Facilities or areas used for the handling, receiving, storing, or disposal of hazardous wastes. 
                  (2)  Hazardous or solid waste landfills. 
                  (3)  Septic tanks and septic tank drainfields within the 100-foot buffer, except as related to permitted single-family dwellings.

                  Sec. 30-22. - Minimum requirements using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land disturbing activities that are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion and sedimentation control plans. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sedimentation pollution during all stages of any land disturbing activity. 
                  (b)  Best management practices. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in this subsection (b) and subsection (c) of this section shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(2) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f) of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq. As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq., for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes that are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f) of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq., for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (c)  Minimum requirements. The rules and regulations or resolutions adopted pursuant to this article for the purpose of governing land disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, published by the state soil and water conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in subsection (c)(16) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; provided, however, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 through 12-5-457 of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq., shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq., except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)  Additional requirements. Nothing contained in this article shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  Presumption of violation. The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. of 4-18-1996; Res. of 8-15-1996, § 2.1; Ord. of 2-6-2007(1))

Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Soil erosion and sedimentation control plans shall conform to the provisions of section 30-22(b) and (c). Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's soil erosion and sedimentation control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan or that such a visit was not required in accordance with rules and regulations established by the board. 
                  (3)  A fee in the amount of $80.00 shall be charged for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area. 
                  (4)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a), half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (5)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. A district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of a district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 30-22(c)(15) and (16) and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(7) of this section, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. 
                  (6)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (7)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this article or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 30-22(b) and (c). Conformance with the minimum requirements may be attained through the use of design criteria in the current issue of the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, published by the state soil and water conservation commission, as a guide; or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local articles and state laws.

If any person commences any land disturbing activity requiring a land disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  (b)  Stop work orders. 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop work order requiring that land disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop work order in lieu of a warning. 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop work order. 
                  (3)  All stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  (4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 30-23(b)(7). The issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provision of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

                  (b)  The fact that a land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (c)  No provision of this article shall permit any persons to violate the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq., as amended; the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq.; or the rules and regulations promulgated and approved thereunder, nor to pollute any waters of the state as defined thereby.

                  DIVISION 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 

                  Sec. 38-19. - Authorization. 
                  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the county commissioner, does ordain as follows: 
                  (Ord. of 9-2-2010) 
                  Sec. 38-20. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. of 9-2-2010) 
                  Sec. 38-21. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion, and; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  (Ord. of 9-2-2010) 
                  Sec. 38-22. - Objectives.

                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions, and; 
                  (7)  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  DIVISION 4. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 38-61. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one-square-inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one-foot above grade; and, 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area, and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters; 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding, and; 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
                  (Ord. of 9-2-2010) 
                  Sec. 38-62. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one-foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 38-61(4), "elevated buildings". 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one-foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Non-residential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one-foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 38-53(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: 
                  1.  Individual lots or parcels, 
                  2.  In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, 
                  3.  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or 
                  4.  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one-foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one-foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. section 38-61(6)) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions), or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (3)a.—c. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 38-32, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if section 38-62(4)a. is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 4.

                  Sec. 38-63. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 38-32, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-Zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 38-32, then the building inspector shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of division 4. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following subsections (2) and (3) shall apply: 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one-foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  Note: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one-foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 38-61(4) "elevated buildings". All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site.

                  Sec. 38-81. - Variance procedures. 
                  (a)  The building department as established by the county commissioner, shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the building inspector in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the building department may appeal such decision to the superior court of the county, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the (building department) shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause, 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and; 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The building inspector shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal emergency management agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the building department may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this code. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
                  Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of the national flood insurance program, the national geodetic vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
                  National geodetic vertical datum ( NGVD ) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after September 6, 1996, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after August 15, 1996, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after August 15, 1996. 
                  North American vertical datum ( NAVD ) has replaced the national geodetic vertical datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA flood modernization maps. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle, which is: 
                  (1)  Built on a single chassis; 
                  (2)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
                  (3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
                  (4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Note— Accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include: 
                  (1)  Those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or 
                  (2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
                  Note— The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  (a)  The owner or occupant or person in charge of any dwelling unit, structure or use to which has been assigned shall be notified in writing by the 911 mapping department of the number assigned to same at any time after the adoption date of the ordinance from which this article is derived. 
                  (b)  Within 60 days after receipt of such written notification, the owner or occupant or person in charge of any dwelling unit, structure or use to which a number has been assigned shall cause the same to be posted and subsequently maintained in either one or two locations, depending on the conditions: 
                  (1)  If the mailbox is located on the same side of the street and adjacent to the driveway or curb cut, the number may be affixed to the mailbox in letters four inches in height or larger and of a color specified by the 911 center. This subsection does not preclude an individual from also numbering the front entrance of the structure if so desired. 
                  (2)  If the mailbox is not on the same side of the street and adjacent to the driveway or curb cut, the number shall be posted at two locations:

                  b.  On an aboveground sign attached to a post or other object at the driveway or curb cut. If attached to a post or other object at the driveway or curb cut, said post or object shall measure two to three feet in height.

                  (d)  It shall be the duty of the owner, occupant, or person in charge of the dwelling unit, structure or use, upon affixing the new number, to remove any different number which might be mistaken for or be confused with the number assigned to the structure by the 911 mapping department. 
                  (e)  If the assigned number cannot be posted as required by this section, the number shall be posted as prescribed by the 911 mapping department after consultation with the owner, occupant or person in charge of the dwelling unit, structure or use.

                  Sec. 58-85. - Types of numbers. 
                  Two types of numbers are used in this article: 
                  (1)  A primary address number to be assigned to each street or road frontage of each parcel of land, whether or not the parcel is occupied. The primary number is required to be posted only if the parcel is occupied by a dwelling unit, structure or use and the owner, occupant or person in charge is notified under section 58-84(a). Other primary numbers are reserved for future development of the numbered parcels and will be assigned at the time of the development. 
                  (2)  Secondary numbers may be used when the number of units, structures, or uses coexists on the same parcel of land. Examples of parcels requiring secondary numbers include apartment projects, condominium projects, mobile home parks, office parks, planned unit developments and other uses where the use of secondary numbers is necessary to clarify the location of a unit or use for public safety purposes. To provide secondary numbers, the 911 mapping department shall work with the owner, manager, or person in charge of the project to determine a logical numbering system under the following guidelines: 
                  a.  Existing numbered units and uses may retain the present set of addresses, with the approval of the 911 mapping department, with only the primary numbers complying with this article. 
                  b.  Buildings on a single parcel with more than one and less than five units shall be given either letters (preferred) or number designations as requested by the owner. 
                  c.  A single building on a single parcel of land and with five or more units shall be given numerical designations such as Suite 5, Apartment 5, etc., if so desired. 
                  d.  Multiple structures on the same parcel of land may be given secondary number designations if the buildings are accessed from the main entrance to the project. Generally the number designations should increase in a clockwise direction from the main entrance. 
                  (Ord. of 2-6-2007(2), § 5) 
                  Sec. 58-86. - Implementation in stages. 
                  Because of the large and complex nature of the county and the existing numbering system now in place on some portions of the county, this article shall be implemented in stages covering small sections of the entire area without the need for the adoption of supplementary implementation resolutions for each section of the county. 
                  (Ord. of 2-6-2007(2), § 6) 
                  Sec. 58-87. - Exempt and excluded structures.

                  The county, after diligent study and review, hereby joins with the other participants in finding and declaring that there is a need for an authority to function in the area of solid waste management.

                  Sec. 66-64. - Purpose and intent. 
                  (a)  The sole commissioner has determined that the nonpayment of ad valorem taxes by property owners effectively shifts a greater tax burden to property owners willing and able to pay their share of such taxes. 
                  (b)  The failure to pay ad valorem taxes creates significant barriers to marketability of property and nonjudicial tax foreclosure procedures are inefficient and lengthy, commonly resulting in title to real property that is neither marketable nor insurable. 
                  (c)  Tax delinquency in many instances also results in properties that present health and safety hazards to the public. 
                  (d)  The sole commissioner finds that the alternative to nonjudicial tax foreclosure procedures authorized by the O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-75 through 48-4-81 is an effective means of eliminating health and safety hazards by putting certain tax delinquent properties back in the tax rolls and into productive use.

                  Sec. 66-65. - Procedure. 
                  In addition to any other rights and remedies provided under state law for the enforcement of tax liens by the county, the collecting officers for taxes may proceed with judicial in rem of tax foreclosures for delinquent taxes in accordance with the provisions of the O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-75 through 48-4-81, and this article shall be sufficient authority for use of the provisions of the judicial tax foreclosure procedures as set out in said state law sections by the appropriate tax collecting officials of the county.

                  (a)  The alternate method of judicial in rem foreclosure procedures as set out in O.C.G.A. 48-4-76—48-4-81 is hereby authorized to be used by the tax commissioner of the county and other tax collecting municipalities of properties located in the county. 
                  (b)  The criteria for the selection of properties to be subject to the provision of judicial in rem tax foreclosures include the following: 
                  (1)  When it appears that the taxes will not be paid before sale or the property will not be redeemed before the end of the redemption period. 
                  (2)  When the taxes are owed on an estate or the property has title problems. 
                  (3)  When dealing with a tract of land that could be deemed as an excessive levy. 
                  (4)  When the property is suitable to be acquired by a land bank authority. 
                  (5)  When there are environmental problems associated with the property.

                  Hazardous waste means any solid waste that has been defined as a hazardous waste in regulations promulgated by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to the federal act codified as 40 CFR 261, and as amended. 
                  Lot means the contiguous land in the same ownership which is not divided by any public highway or alley, including any part thereof subject to any easement for any purpose other than a public highway or alley, but excluding any part thereof severed from another lot where the severance creates any nonconformity of size or use. 
                  Perennial river or stream means a river/stream or section of a river or stream that normally flows continuously throughout the whole year. 
                  Protected river corridor means all land, inclusive of islands, in areas of a protected river within a distance of 100 feet horizontally on both sides of the river measured from the uppermost part of the riverbank; the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the water is included in the protected area. 
                  Riverbank or streambank means the rising ground, bordering a river or a stream, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow. 
                  Section 404 refers to section 404 (33 USC 1344) of the U.S. Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1251 et seq. 
                  Septic tank means a subsurface impervious tank designated to temporarily retain sewage or similar waterborne wastes, together with: 
                  (1)  A sewer line constructed with solid pipe, with the joints sealed, connecting such impervious tank with a plumbing stubout; and

                  Subdivision means all divisions of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots, building sites, or other divisions for the purpose of sale, legacy, or building development, whether immediate or future. This shall include all divisions or resubdivisions of land involving a new road or change in existing roads.

                  (Ord. of 10-21-1999(2), § 3) 
                  Sec. 70-44. - Violations and penalties. 
                  (a)  Violators. Violation of these provisions, prohibitions, and installation restrictions by any private individual, landowner, builder, remodeler, contractor, licensed electrician, licensed plumber, septic tank dealer or installer, mobile or manufactured home dealer or mover, or developer, or installation and delivery of any utility services by a public or private utility to any property which holds a septic tank system installed against these prohibitions and restrictions, shall be a violation of this article. 
                  (b)  Penalty. Any person violating, neglecting, or refusing to comply with any provision of this article shall be subject to penalties as set forth in section 1-7. 
                  (Res. of 6-20-1986(2), § 7; Ord. of 10-21-1999(2), § 10) 
                  Sec. 70-45. - Permit. 
                  (a)  Septic tanks permitted. No septic tank shall be installed where a public sewer is accessible to the premises involved, nor in any place where the health inspector deems the use of a septic tank to be a menace to human health or a nuisance to the general welfare of the county. 
                  (b)  On-site sewage management permit required. Prior to the construction of any house or building, or alteration or addition thereto, and prior to the location or relocation of any mobile home in the county from which sewage must be disposed of by means of a septic tank or alternative system, an on-site sewage management permit must be obtained from the county health department, in addition to any other required building or relocation permits. 
                  (c)  Subdivisions. Where private systems for the disposal of sewage and other liquid wastes are proposed in any planned subdivision, before any person may develop the subdivision and before the sale of any lots therein or the erection of any buildings thereon, the owner or his designee shall file such plats, plans, and specifications as the health inspector may deem necessary to evaluate the permissibility of the planned subdivision sewage systems. Upon approval, the health inspector shall issue a permit as set forth in this article. 
                  (d)  Permit coordination. The permit shall not be issued, and no construction, erection, move, or other activity regulated by this article may proceed, until the county health department issues an on-site sewage management construction permit or a site approval letter, whichever is appropriate, so that all lots proposed to be used or subdivided would satisfy the requirements of this article, including the rules of the state department of human resources for on-site sewage management systems. 
                  (e)  Form and contents of application. The application for the permit shall be made on the form prescribed by the health department and shall include, at a minimum, the following information: 
                  (1)  The name and address of the applicant; 
                  (2)  The address of the location of the building or mobile home for which the permit is sought; 
                  (3)  For residential structures, the number of bedrooms contained or to be contained therein; and 
                  (4)  For commercial or industrial structures, the amount of the anticipated water usage. 
                  (f)  Duties of health department. It is the duty of the county health department to evaluate the proposed structure and to issue the on-site sewage management permit for those sites that comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by the county health department for on-site sewage management systems. 
                  (g)  Duties of applicant. It shall be the duty of the property owner or building contractor, or the applicant, if different from the property owner or building contractor, to request evaluation by the health department, prior to beginning construction or prior to locating or relocating a mobile home, for purposes of determining if the septic tank system complies with the rules and regulations promulgated by the county health department for on-site sewage management systems. 
                  (h)  Minimum lot size. All lots intended for residential or other use within the county shall be of such size as is specified by the county health department according to the Rules of Georgia Department of Human Resources Public Health for On-Site Sewage Management Systems Manual for On-Site Sewage Management and/or this article, whichever is more stringent; provided, however, that if the lot includes or will include a septic tank, it shall be: 
                  (1)  Not less than 1.5 acres if a water well is used on the same lot; or 
                  (2)  Not less than 0.75 acre if there will be no water well and the lot will use the public water supply system. 
                  (i)  Requirements are minimum. The regulations and requirements set by this article shall be the minimum requirements. 
                  (j)  Preexisting uses. The provisions of this article regarding minimum lot size shall not apply to lots that are the subject of a plat recorded prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived or a deed conveying ownership to the current owner recorded prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived. 
                  (k)  Compliance with state and federal regulations. All developments, structures, and uses within the county shall also meet the requirements of all other local, federal and state regulations in effect, including but not limited to department of transportation regulations, state fire marshal regulations, the state's uniform construction codes, state department of natural resources, and state environmental protection division environmental rules and regulations. Issuance of a permit under this article does not constitute certification of compliance with such codes or regulations, and does not abrogate responsibility of the owner to so comply. 
                  (l)  Map interpretation. If there is any uncertainty as to whether a lot, portion of lot, or a proposed construction or location impacts an environmental resource regulated by this article because of interpretation of the applicable map, the decision of the sole commissioner or the county health department shall take precedence and be considered correct and final, but may be appealed as set forth in this article. 
                  (m)  Appeal. Any person who feels aggrieved by a decision of the sole commissioner or the county health department, as appropriate, regarding map interpretation may at his own expense request reconsideration. Such reconsideration shall include submission of scientific evidence for reversal of the alleged error in map interpretation, and such evidence must be documented by a state registered engineer, geologist, or soils scientist. To obtain a reversal of the decision of map interpretation, the evidence must be acceptable to the state department of natural resources' environmental protection division, and the sole commissioner, and/or the county health department. Any costs for submission of evidence to the state department of natural resources' environmental protection division shall be borne by the person requesting reconsideration. 
                  (n)  Coordination with zoning and other regulation. The provisions of this article shall be coordinated with any zoning or other regulations adopted by the sole commissioner, and if there is any conflict with those zoning or other regulations, the stricter provisions shall apply. If zoning is or has been adopted, the provisions of this article shall be considered an overlay, or additional requirements to the requirements of underlying zoning regulations and district. 
                  (o)  Fees. Any fees for applications, inspections, and the issuance of permits or certificates required or issued under the provisions of this article shall be paid by the person seeking such permit at the time of application in advance of the issuance of such permits or certificates. The amount of such fees, if any, shall be those established by the sole commissioner from time to time. 
                  (Res. of 6-20-1986(2), §§ 1, 2; Ord. of 10-21-1999(2), §§ 4.1—4.10) 
                  Sec. 70-46. - Variances. 
                  When due to a particular hardship or extraordinary circumstance of the property involved which is not easily corrected, it is impractical for an owner or developer to comply with all of the requirements of this article, the sole commissioner shall be authorized to vary such requirements (under its jurisdiction) only to such extent as to provide fairness to the owner or developer and as to not violate the intent and purposes of this article. Such variances shall only be granted in an official public meeting, and the reasons for granting them shall be entered into the minutes of the public meeting. 
                  (Ord. of 10-21-1999(2), § 9) 
                  Sec. 70-47. - Jurisdiction.
