PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Waynesboro, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1995 Code, as supplemented through August 21, 2014, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the mayor and council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1995 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and K. Barrington, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to City Manager, Jerry L. Coalson, and City Attorney, Christopher Dube, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  (c)  The people of this state have the inherent right of regulating their internal government. Government is instituted for the protection, security, and benefit of the people; and at all times they have the right to alter or reform the same whenever the public good may require it. 
                  (d)  The people have a right to expect that every public official will conduct himself in a manner that will tend to preserve public confidence in and respect for the government he represents. 
                  (e)  Such confidence and respect can best be promoted if every public official, whether paid or unpaid, and whether elected or appointed, will uniformly:

                  (2)  Avoid conflicts between their private self-interest and the public interest.

                  (2)  To establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all such officials by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interest of the city; 
                  (3)  To require disclosure by such officials of private financial or other interest in matters affecting the city; and 
                  (4)  To serve as a basis for disciplining those who refuse to abide by its terms. 
                  (c)  Exemption. The provisions of this code shall not apply to political contributions, loans, expenditures, reports or regulation of political campaigns or the conduct of candidates in such campaigns.

                  (2)  The notice shall include a summary of the dog control officer's findings that form the basis for the dog's classification as a dangerous dog or potentially dangerous dog; 
                  (3)  The notice shall be dated and shall state that the owner has a right to request a hearing on the classification within 15 days from the date of the notice; 
                  (4)  The notice shall state that the city council shall conduct the hearing; 
                  (5)  The notice shall state that if the owner does not request such a hearing within 15 days from the date of the notice, the classification of the dog as a dangerous dog or potentially dangerous dog shall be final and conclusive for all purposes; 
                  (6)  The notice shall include a form to request a hearing before the city council and shall provide specific instructions on mailing or delivering such a request.

At the hearing, the owner shall be given the opportunity to testify and to present evidence. The council shall also receive such other evidence and hear such other testimony as it may find reasonably necessary to make a determination either to sustain, modify or overrule the classification of the dog by the dog control officer. Within ten days of the date of the hearing, the council shall notify the owner in writing by certified mail of its determination on the matter. If the determination is made that the dog is a dangerous dog or potentially dangerous dog, the notice shall specify the date upon which that determination is effective. Unless the council determines that a later date is appropriate in a particular case, the effective date of the determination shall be the date of the dog control officer's classification. 
                  (c)  If the identity of the owner of a dog which the dog control officer has classified as a dangerous dog or potentially dangerous dog cannot be determined, the dog shall be immediately confiscated. If the dog's owner claims such a dog, the dog shall be released to its owner, together with a copy of the notice specified in subsection (a) of this section. If the dog remains unclaimed for five days, the dog shall be destroyed in an expeditious and humane manner. Under no circumstances shall such dog be placed for adoption.

                  ARTICLE VI. - ADULT ESTABLISHMENTS 

                  Sec. 26-161. - Purpose and findings. 
                  (a)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses, including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments as defined herein, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses and the adverse affect on property values and on the public health, safety, and welfare of the city, and on its citizens and property, and on the character and preservation of its neighborhoods and development will be curtailed. This article is not intended as a defacto prohibition of legally protected forms of expression. This article is intended to represent a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods and development through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus any legally protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons. This article is not intended to allow or license any business, establishment, or activity which would otherwise be unlawful. 
                  (b)  Findings. Based on the experience of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta, Georgia; Fulton County, Georgia; Dekalb County, Georgia; Augusta-Richmond County, Georgia; Floyd County, Georgia; Amarillo, Texas; Austin, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Houston, Texas; Renton, Washington; Phoenix, Arizona; LaGrange, Georgia; Dalton, Georgia; Whitfield County, Georgia; Carrollton, Georgia; Smyrna, Georgia; Rome, Georgia; Bartow County, Georgia; and Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida, which experiences are believed to be relevant to the problems faced by the city, the mayor and city council take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the findings of the mayor and city council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore the limitation of nude conduct in establishments licensed within the city limits and prohibiting the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in said establishments is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity. Based on these findings, this article is adopted to regulate certain types of businesses and to establish where such activity may or may not be conducted.

                  (4)  The construction of single-family residences, when such construction disturbs less than one acre and is not a part of a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre and not otherwise exempted under this subsection; provided, however, that construction of any such residence shall conform to the minimum requirements as set forth in section 50-79. For single-family residence construction covered by the provisions of this subsection, there shall be a buffer zone between the residence and any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to the Georgia Water Quality Control Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq.). In any such buffer zone, no land-disturbing activity shall be constructed between the residence and the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action from the banks of the trout waters. For primary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. For secondary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, but the director may grant variances to no less than 25 feet. Regardless of whether a trout stream is primary or secondary, for first order trout waters, which are streams into which no other streams flow except for springs, the buffer shall be at least 25 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. The minimum requirements of section 50-79 and the buffer zones provided by this section shall be enforced by the issuing authority; 
                  (5)  Agricultural operations as defined in O.C.G.A. § 1-3-3 to include raising, harvesting or storing of products of the field or orchard; the preparation and planting of pasture land; farm ponds; dairy operations; livestock and poultry management practices; and the construction of farm buildings; 
                  (6)  Forestry land management practices, including harvesting; provided, however, that when such exempt forestry practices cause or result in land-disturbing or other activities otherwise prohibited in a buffer, as established in section 50-79(c)(15) and (16), no other land-disturbing activities, except for normal forest management practices, shall be allowed on the entire property upon which the forestry practices were conducted for a period of three years after completion of such forestry practices; 
                  (7)  Any project carried out under the technical supervision of the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the United States Department of Agriculture; 
                  (8)  Any project involving less than one acre of disturbed area; provided, however, that this exemption shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity within a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre or within 200 feet of the bank of any state waters, and for purposes of this subsection, the term "state waters" excludes channels and drainageways which have water in them only during and immediately after rainfall events and intermittent streams which do not have water in them yearround; provided, however, that any person responsible for a project which involves less than one acre, which involves land-disturbing activity, and which is within 200 feet of any such excluded channel or drainageway must prevent sediment from moving beyond the boundaries of the property on which such project is located and provided, further, that nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent a city or county which is a local issuing authority from regulating any such project which is not specifically exempted by subsection (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (9), or (10) of this section; 
                  (9)  Construction or maintenance projects, or both, undertaken or financed in whole or in part, or both, by the department of transportation, the Georgia Highway Authority, or the state road and tollway authority; or any road construction or maintenance project, or both, undertaken by any county or municipality; provided, however, that construction or maintenance projects of the department of transportation or the state road and tollway authority which disturb one or more contiguous acres of land shall be subject to the provisions of section 50-79(b) and (c); except where the department of transportation, the Georgia Highway Authority, or the state road and tollway authority is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state general permit, in which case a copy of a notice of intent under the state general permit shall be submitted to the local issuing authority, the local issuing authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders; 
                  (10)  Any land-disturbing activities conducted by any electric membership corporation or municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the public service commission, any utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as defined in O.C.G.A. § 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United States engaged in the generation, transmission, or distribution of power; except where an electric membership corporation or municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the public service commission, any utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as defined in O.C.G.A. § 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United States engaged in the generation, transmission, or distribution of power is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state general permit, in which case the local issuing authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in section 50-79(b) and (c) as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders;

                  Sec. 50-79. - Minimum requirements for erosion and sedimentation control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not excluded by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion and sedimentation control plans. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installation, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sedimentation pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(2) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f). As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed to control soil erosion and sedimentation for all rainfall events up to and including a 25-year, 24-hour rainfall event designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia. 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or by the division or of any general permit for construction activities issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f) for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or by the division or any general permit for construction activities issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f) for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this article for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975 (O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.); 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in subsection (c)(16) of this section, there is established a 25 foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; provided, however, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to the Metropolitan River Protection Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq.), shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed. The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  a.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  b.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (16)  There is established a 50 foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to the Georgia Water Quality Control Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq.), except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25 foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed. The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  a.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  b.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in this article shall prevent an issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

                  Sec. 50-80. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall review the general development plans and detailed plans of the issuing authority that affect the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall review the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and other ordinances which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the issuing authority. However, the property owner is the only party who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Waynesboro without first obtaining a permit from the building inspector to perform such activity. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the building inspector and must include the applicant's erosion and sedimentation control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Soil erosion and sedimentation control plans shall conform to the provisions of section 50-79(b) and (c). Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by two copies of the applicant's soil erosion and sedimentation control plans. 
                  (3)  A fee, in the amount of $250.00, shall be charged for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the issuing authority.

                  ARTICLE VII. - BRIER CREEK WATER SUPPLY PROTECTION 

                  Sec. 50-136. - Purpose. 
                  (a)  In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the City of Waynesboro, Georgia, and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted development. Land-disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxicants, nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies. 
                  (b)  The purpose of this article is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of the City of Waynesboro; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This article shall apply to all existing and proposed water supply watersheds within the City of Waynesboro.

                  Corridor means all land within the buffer areas established adjacent to reservoirs or perennial streams within a water supply watershed and within other setback areas specified in section 50-139. 
                  Impervious surface means a manmade structure or surface that prevents the infiltration of stormwater into the ground below the structure or surface. Examples are buildings, roads, driveways, parking lots, decks, swimming pools, or patios. 
                  Large water supply watershed means a watershed containing 100 square miles or more of land within the drainage basin upstream of a governmentally owned public drinking water supply intake. 
                  Perennial stream means a stream that flows throughout the whole year as indicated on a USGS Quad Map. 
                  Reservoir boundary means the edge of a water supply reservoir defined by its normal pool level. 
                  Small water supply watershed means a watershed that contains less than 100 square miles of land within the drainage basin upstream of a governmentally owned public drinking water supply intake. 
                  Utility means public or private water or sewer piping systems, water or sewer pumping stations, electric power lines, fuel pipelines, telephone lines, roads, driveways, bridges, river/lake access facilities, stormwater systems and railroads or other utilities identified by a local government.

When, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this chapter would result in the exceptional practical difficulty or undue economic hardship upon any owner of a specific property, the commission, in passing upon applications, shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to the provisions, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided, however, that such variances, modifications, or interpretations shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of said provisions, so that the architectural or historical integrity or character of the property shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variations, the commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgment, best fulfill the purpose of this chapter. An undue hardship shall not be a situation of the person's own making. The commission shall consider the following factors for any variance requested: 
                  (1)  Cost of necessary improvements compared to the cost of the entire project; 
                  (2)  Whether or not the necessary improvements could be made over a specified period of time in order to minimize the economic hardship of compliance with this chapter; 
                  (3)  Impact of the variance on adjacent properties and the likelihood of future requests for similar variances and whether allowing a variance would compromise the integrity of the property or surrounding properties; 
                  (4)  The circumstances surrounding the undue hardship; and 
                  (5)  Whether the hardship was created by the current property owner. 
                  (j)  Deadline for approval or rejection of application for certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (1)  The commission shall approve or reject an application for a certificate of appropriateness within 45 days after the filing thereof by the owner or occupant of a historic property, or of a building, structure, site, or object located within a historic district. Evidence of approval shall be by a certificate of appropriateness issued by the commission. Written notice of the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness shall be sent by United States mail or shall be hand-delivered to the applicant and to all other persons who have requested such notice in writing filed with the commission. 
                  (2)  Failure of the commission to act within 45 days shall constitute approval, and no other evidence of approval shall be needed. 
                  (k)  Necessary action to be taken by commission upon rejection of application for certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (1)  In the event the commission rejects an application, it shall state its reasons for doing so, and shall transmit a record of such action and the reasons therefore, in writing, to the applicant. The commission may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves of the application submitted. The applicant, if he or she so desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so. 
                  (2)  In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of an application for a certificate of appropriateness by the commission shall be binding upon the applicant and administrative officers charged with issuing building permits and, in such a case, no building permit shall be issued. 
                  (l)  Requirement of conformance with certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (1)  All work performed pursuant to an issued certificate of appropriateness shall conform to the requirements of such certificate. In the event work is performed not in accordance with such certificate, the commission shall issue a cease and desist order and all work shall cease. 
                  (2)  The commission or the city council shall be authorized to institute any appropriate action or proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent any material change in appearance of a designated historic property or historic district, except those changes made in compliance with the provisions of this chapter or to prevent any illegal act or conduct with respect to such historic property or historic district. 
                  (m)  Certificate of appropriateness void if construction not commenced. A certificate of appropriateness shall become void unless the permitted activity is commenced within six months of date of issuance. All work performed under a certificate of appropriateness must be completed within 12 months of the date of issuance. 
                  (n)  Recording an application for certificate of appropriateness. The commission shall keep a record of all applications for certificates of appropriateness, and of all the commission's proceedings in connection with said application. 
                  (o)  Acquisition of property. The commission may, where such action is authorized by the city council and is reasonably necessary or appropriate for the preservation of a unique historic property, enter into negotiations with the owner for acquisition of the property or any interest therein by gift, purchase, exchange, or otherwise. 
                  (p)  Appeals. Any person adversely affected by any determination made by the commission relative to the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness may appeal such determination to the city council. Any such appeal must be filed with the city manager within 15 days after the issuance of the determination pursuant to subsection (j) of this section or, in the case of a failure of the commission to act, within 15 days of the expiration of the 45-day period allowed for the commission action. The city council may approve, modify and approve, or reject the determination made by the commission, if the city council finds that the commission abused its discretion in reaching its decision. Appeals from decisions of the city council may be taken to the Superior Court of Burke County in the manner provided by law for appeals from a conviction for municipal ordinance violations.

                  State Law reference— Certificates of appropriateness, O.C.G.A. § 44-10-28 et seq. 
                  Sec. 62-6. - Maintenance of historic properties. 
                  (a)  Ordinary maintenance or repair. Ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural or environmental feature in or on a historic property to correct deterioration, decay, or to sustain the existing form, and that does not involve a material change in design, material or outer appearance thereof, does not require a certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (b)  Failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair; deterioration neglect. Property owners of historic properties or properties within historic districts shall not allow their buildings to deteriorate by failing to provide ordinary maintenance or repair. The commission shall be charged with the following responsibilities regarding deterioration by neglect. 
                  (1)  The commission and city staff shall monitor the condition of historic properties and existing buildings in historic districts to determine if they are being allowed to deteriorate by neglect. Such conditions as broken windows, doors and exterior openings which allow the elements and vermin to enter, or the deterioration of a building's structural system, shall constitute failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair. Owners shall maintain their structures so as not to endanger the property by permitting the following conditions or other similar conditions which jeopardize structural integrity. 
                  a.  Foundations. Deteriorated or inadequate foundations jeopardize structural integrity. All foundations shall support the structure as originally constructed, and at all points shall be free of holes, wide cracks, and buckling. 
                  b.  Structural members. Defective or deteriorated floor supports, or any structural members of insufficient size to carry imposed loads with safety jeopardize structural integrity. Members of walls, partitions, or other vertical supports that split, lean, list or buckle due to defective material or deterioration jeopardize structural integrity. Structural members of ceilings and roofs, or other horizontal structural members, which sag, split or buckle due to defective materials or deterioration or are of insufficient size to carry imposed loads with safety jeopardize structural integrity. Interior staircases shall be maintained in good repair. 
                  c.  Exterior surfaces and materials. Floors, exterior walls and roofs having holes, wide cracks and loose, warped, protruding or rotting boards or any other condition admitting moisture or other elements jeopardize structural integrity. Exterior surfaces exposed to the weather shall be repaired and weatherproofed, where appropriate to protect them from further deterioration. Masonry joints shall be maintained. Fireplaces or chimneys which list, bulge or settle due to defective material or deterioration, or are of insufficient size or strength to carry imposed loads with safety jeopardize structural integrity. 
                  d.  Weather protection and ventilation. Lack of weather protection, any fault or defect in the building which renders it structurally unsafe or not weather-tight jeopardizes structural integrity. Windows, exterior doors and exterior siding shall be watertight. Exterior flashing, including that at chimneys, doors, and windows, shall be maintained in good repair. Down spouts and gutters shall be maintained in good repair. Proper ventilation for crawl and attic spaces shall be maintained. 
                  e.  Stairways, porches and appurtenances. Exterior staircases, porches, and appurtenances thereto shall be maintained in good repair. 
                  f.  Rodent and termite infestation. Structures shall be kept free of wood boring insects and rodent infestation. 
                  g.  Security and utilities. Buildings which are no longer occupied shall be properly secured to prevent intrusion, and all utilities shall be properly connected or disconnected. 
                  h.  Dependencies and additional site features. Ancillary structures and accessory buildings shall be maintained in good repair. Tree limbs shall be trimmed away from the building, and tree roots shall be cleared away from all foundations. Soil erosion and soil deposition shall not be allowed to endanger any structures. 
                  (2)  In the event the commission determines a failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair, the commission will notify the owner of the property in writing of the action which must to be taken to remedy the situation. The owner of such property will have 30 days in which to correct the noted deficiencies. 
                  (3)  The notice provided in subsection (b)(2) of this section shall be served upon the owner and occupants as follows: 
                  a.  A representative of the city, or any adult citizen of this state, may execute an affidavit of service reciting that a copy of the notice was served upon such persons either personally, or by leaving a copy at the place of each person's residence. This shall be sufficient evidence as to the proper service of the owner and/or occupant. 
                  b.  If any of the aforementioned persons reside out of the city, but within the state, service shall be effected by causing a copy of the notice to be served upon such party or parties by the sheriff or any lawful deputy of the county of residence of such party, or such service may be made by any adult citizen, as to personal service or service by leaving a copy at such party's residence. An affidavit reciting same shall be conclusive as to such service. 
                  c.  In the event either the owner or occupant is a minor or an insane person or person laboring under disabilities, the guardian or other personal representative of such person shall be personally served, and if such guardian or personal representative resides outside of the city or is a nonresident, he shall be served as provided above in such cases. If such minor or insane person or person laboring under disabilities has no guardian or personal representative or in the event such minor or insane person lives outside the city or is a nonresident, service shall be perfected by serving such minor or insane person personally by leaving a copy at the place of his residence which shall be sufficient evidence as to the service of such person or persons. In the case of minors or insane persons, service shall be perfected by serving the judge of the probate court of the county, who shall stand in the place of and protect the rights of such minor or insane persons or appoint a guardian ad litem for such person. 
                  d.  In the event the whereabouts of any owner or occupant is unknown and the whereabouts cannot be ascertained by city representatives in the exercise of reasonable diligence, the city representative shall make an affidavit to that effect, and the service of such notice upon such person shall be made by publication in the local legal organ for one week. Service may be further perfected upon any person, firm or corporation holding itself out as agent for the property involved. 
                  (4)  In the event the defects or conditions are not corrected in 30 days from the date of service, the owner shall be issued a citation for violation of this chapter and, if convicted, such person shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $500.00 or imprisonment for 60 days, or both such fine and imprisonment. Each day upon which any violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. Additionally, at the direction of the city council, the city may perform or contract to perform such maintenance or repair as is necessary to prevent deterioration by neglect. The owner of the property shall be liable for the cost of such maintenance and repair performed by the city. 
                  (c)  Monitoring of condition. Commission members and city staff shall monitor the condition of all designated historic properties and places, sites, buildings, structures, and works of art within designated historic districts. Commission members or city staff representatives shall report any failure to provide ordinary maintenance and repair to the building inspector of the city. The conditions outlined in subsection (b)(1) of this section shall constitute a failure to provide ordinary maintenance and repair. 
                  (d)  Condition assessment. Upon notification by the commission member or city staff representative, the building inspector or his designee shall be authorized to enter upon premises for the purpose of making examinations and inspections regarding conformity to the requirements hereunder. Such entry shall be made in such a manner as to cause the least possible inconvenience to any persons in possession. The city council may appoint and affix the duties of such agents, designees and employees as reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter. The building inspector or other official designated by the city shall prepare a condition assessment report for the commission. 
                  (e)  Lien for ordinary maintenance and repairs. 
                  (1)  At the direction of the city council, ordinary maintenance and repair necessary to prevent deterioration or demolition by neglect may be performed by someone other than the owner. The owner of the property shall be liable for the cost of such maintenance and repair. The amount of the cost of such maintenance or repair shall be a lien against the real property upon which the maintained or repaired structure is situated. The lien shall attach to the real property at the time of payment of all costs by the city, and shall be filed in the office of the city clerk and on the general execution docket maintained by the Clerk of the Superior Court of Burke County. Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise. 
                  (2)  The city may enforce the collection of any amount due on such lien in the following manner: 
                  a.  The owner or parties in interest shall be allowed to satisfy the amount due on such lien by paying the city within 30 days after the perfection of such lien, a sum of money equal to 25 percent of the total amount due and by further paying to the city the remaining balance due on such lien, together with interest at the rate of seven percent per annum, in three equal annual payments, each of which shall become due and payable on the anniversary date of the initial payment made as prescribed in this subsection; 
                  b.  Should the property upon which such lien is perfected be sold, transferred or conveyed by the owner or parties in interest any time prior to the termination of the three-year period, then the entire balance due on such lien shall be due and payable to the city at the time of the sale, transfer or conveyance; and 
                  c.  Should the amount of such lien, or any portion thereof, be unpaid after the passage of such three-year period, or upon the occurrence of the contingency provided for in subsection (b)(2) of this section, the city may enforce the collection of any amount due on such lien for repair of dwellings, buildings or other structures in the same manner as provided for the collection of municipal property taxes, as permitted by applicable state statutes. This procedure shall be subject to the right of redemption by any persons having any right, title or interest in or lien upon such property, as provided by O.C.G.A. § 48-4-40. 
                  (f)  Appeals of ordinary maintenance and repair decisions. Any owner or other party in interest adversely affected by the city council's decision relative to the owner's failure to provide ordinary maintenance and repair may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Burke County in the manner provided by law for convictions of municipal ordinance violations, namely, via petition for writ of certiorari. 
                  (g)  Affirmation of existing building and zoning codes. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as to exempt property owners from complying with existing city building and zoning codes, nor prevent any property owner from making any use of this property not prohibited by other statutes, ordinances or regulations.

This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants, and stormwater runoff, soil erosion and non-point source pollution can be minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites. 
                  (2)  The City of Waynesboro establishes this chapter for the regulation of stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It is determined that the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development projects and other construction activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and non-point source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety.

                  Sec. 98-2. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety, environment and welfare of the public and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
                  (1)  Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in order to reduce flooding, siltation and stream bank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels; 
                  (2)  Minimize increases in non-point source pollution caused by stormwater runoff from development, which would otherwise degrade local water quality; 
                  (3)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, non-point source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
                  (4)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
                  (5)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum stormwater management standards; 
                  (6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of stormwater control facilities and practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained and pose no threat to public safety; and 
                  (7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up.

                  w.  Persistent pesticides and/or pesticides regulated by the Federal Insecticide Fungicide Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). 
                  x.  Waters or wastes containing fats, wax, grease or oils, not specifically prohibited in subsection (a)(2)f of this section, in excess of 100 mg/l or containing other substances which may solidify or become viscous between 32 degrees Fahrenheit or zero degrees Centigrade, and 150 degrees Fahrenheit or 65 degrees Centigrade. Waters or wastes containing such substances, excluding normal household wastes, shall not contain any visible floating oils, fats and greases. The use of chemical or physical means to bypass treatment or that will release fats, oils and greases into the POTW is prohibited. 
                  Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this section shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to the POTW. 
                  (b)  Federal categorical pretreatment standards. The National Categorical Pretreatment Standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405—471 are hereby incorporated. 
                  (c)  State requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharges to the POTW shall be met by all users which are subject to such standards in any instance in which they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations, or those in this article or other applicable ordinance. 
                  (d)  Local limits. 
                  (1)  For the period of time the POTW discharges its effluent into Brier Creek, the pretreatment limitations shall be as indicated for Brier Creek. 
                  (2)  The following pollutant limits are established to protect against pass through and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the following instantaneous maximum allowable discharge limits except with approval by permit from the control authority. 

                   
                  The above limits normally apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW (end of the pipe). The city may impose a local limit at the end of a process prior to dilution with other waste streams. All concentrations for metallic substances are for "total" metal unless indicated otherwise. The city manager may impose mass limitations in addition to, or in place of, the above concentration-based limitations. Where a user is subject to a categorical pretreatment standard and a local limit for a given pollutant, the more stringent limit or applicable pretreatment standard shall apply. 
                  (e)  City's right of revision. The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW. 
                  (f)  Special agreement. The city reserves the right to enter into special agreements with users setting out special terms under which they may discharge to the POTW. In no case will a special agreement waive compliance with a categorical pretreatment standard or federal pretreatment requirement. However, the user may request a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. They may also request a variance from the categorical pretreatment standard from the approval authority in accordance with 40 CFR 403.13. 
                  (g)  Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The city manager may impose mass limitations on users that he believes may be using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
                  (h)  Pretreatment facilities. Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with all applicable pretreatment standards and requirements set out in this article within the time limitations specified by the EPA, the state, or the city manager, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities required to pre-treat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city manager for review, and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an acceptable discharge to the city under the provisions of this article. 
                  (i)  Deadline for compliance with applicable pretreatment requirements. 
                  (1)  Compliance by existing users (categorical users) covered by categorical pretreatment standards shall be within three years of the date the standard is effective unless a shorter compliance time is specified in the appropriate standard. The city shall establish a final compliance deadline date for any existing user not covered by categorical pretreatment standards or for any categorical user when the local limits for said user are more restrictive than EPA's categorical pretreatment standards. 
                  (2)  New source discharges and new users are required to comply with applicable pretreatment standards within the shortest feasible time, not to exceed 90 days from the beginning of discharge. New sources and new users shall install and have in operating condition, and shall "start-up" all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge. 
                  (3)  Any wastewater discharge permit issued to a categorical user shall not contain a compliance date beyond any deadline date established in EPA's categorical pretreatment standards. Any other existing user or a categorical user that must comply with a more stringent local limit, which is in noncompliance with any local limits, shall be provided with a compliance schedule placed in an industrial wastewater permit to insure compliance with the shortest time feasible. 
                  (j)  Additional pretreatment measures. 
                  (1)  Whenever deemed necessary, the city manager may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this article. 
                  (2)  The city manager may require any user discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on his property and at his expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. The facility shall be equipped with alarms and a rate of discharge controller, the regulation of which shall be directed by the city manager. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization. 
                  (3)  Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the city manager, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception units shall be of type and capacity approved by the city manager and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at his expense. 
                  (4)  Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter. 
                  (k)  Accidental discharge/slug control. The city manager may require any user to develop and implement an accidental discharge/slug control plan. Where deemed necessary by the city, facilities to prevent accidental discharge or slug discharges of pollutants shall be provided and maintained at the user's cost and expense. An accidental spill prevention plan/slug control (ASPP) plan showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city for review and approval before implementation. The city shall determine which user is required to develop a plan and require said plan to be submitted within a specific number of days after notification by the city. Each user shall implement its ASPP as submitted or as modified after such plan has been reviewed and approved by the city. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures by the city shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of section. 
                  (1)  Any user required to develop and implement an ASPP shall submit a plan that addresses, at a minimum, the following: 
                  a.  Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges; 
                  b.  Description of stored chemicals; 
                  c.  Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any accidental or slug discharge. Such notification must also be given for any discharge which would violate any of the standards in subsections (a) through (d) of this section; and 
                  d.  Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 
                  (2)  Users shall notify city wastewater treatment plant personnel immediately upon the occurrence of a "slug" or "accidental discharge" of substances regulated by this article. The notification shall include location of discharge, date and time thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. Any affected user shall be liable for any expense, loss, or damage to the POTW, in addition to the amount of any fines imposed on the city on account thereof under state or federal law. 
                  (3)  Within five days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the city manager a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law. 
                  (4)  Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on the user's premises advising employees whom to call in the event of a slug or accidental discharge. Employers shall instruct all employees who may cause or discover such a discharge with respect to emergency notification procedures. 
                  (l)  Hauled or septic tank wastes. 
                  (1)  Septic tank waste may be introduced into the POTW only at receiving structures designated by the city, and at such time as are established by the city manager. Such wastes must not violate this article or any other requirements established or adopted by the city. The city manager may require wastewater discharge permits for individual vehicles to use such facilities. 
                  (2)  Septage haulers may only discharge loads at locations specifically designated by the city manager. No load may be discharged without prior consent of the city manager. The city manager may collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards. The city manager may require the hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge. 
                  (3)  Septage haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, sources of waste, and volume and characteristics of waste. 
                  (4)  The city manager may allow hauled industrial waste under special circumstances and on a case-by-case basis. Under no circumstances shall the city allow RCRA defined hazardous wastes. 
                  (5)  Fees for dumping hauled wastes will be established as part of the user fee system as authorized in section 114-189. 
                  (m)  Private connections. 
                  (1)  Private wastewater disposal. 
                  a.  Where a public sanitary sewer is not available under the provisions of section 114-31, the building sewer shall be connected to a private wastewater disposal system complying with the rules and regulations of the city and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. 
                  b.  Septic tanks shall be constructed, repaired, altered, enlarged and maintained in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the Burke County health officer. Septic tanks shall be maintained in sanitary working order. 
                  c.  No person shall construct, repair, alter, or enlarge any septic tank unless he shall hold a valid permit for such work issued by the Burke County health officer. The health officer may withhold the issuance of such a permit pending the inspection and approval by the health officer of the site and location of the proposed work. 
                  d.  Before any septic tank or any part thereof may be covered after it has been constructed, repaired, altered, or enlarged, it shall be inspected and approved by the health officer. 
                  e.  The type, capabilities, location, and layout of a private wastewater disposal system shall comply with all recommendations of the department of natural resources of the State of Georgia. No permit shall be issued for any private wastewater disposal system employing subsurface soil absorption facilities where the area of the lot is less than (square feet). No septic tank or cesspool shall be permitted to discharge to any natural outlet. 
                  f.  No septic tank or other subsurface disposal facility shall be installed where a public sewer is accessible to the premises involved, nor in any place where the health officer deems the use of same to be a menace to human health or well being. 
                  g.  At such time as a public sewer becomes available to a property served by a private wastewater disposal system, a direct connection shall be made to the public sewer within 30 days after notice. Any septic tanks, cesspools, and similar private wastewater disposal facilities shall then be cleaned of sludge and filled with suitable material. 
                  h.  The owner shall operate and maintain the private wastewater disposal facilities in a sanitary manner at all times, at no expense to the city. 
                  i.  No subsurface disposal facilities shall be installed in any place where the health officer deems the use of such facilities to be a menace to human health or well being. 
                  j.  Every flush toilet shall be connected to a public sewer where available or to a septic tank. Flush toilets shall be provided at all times with sufficient running water under pressure to flush the toilet clean after each use. 
                  k.  No pit privy shall be installed in the following locations: 
                  1.  Where a public sewer is accessible to the premises involved; 
                  2.  In areas where the health officer deems the use of pit privies to constitute a nuisance or menace to the public health; 
                  3.  Where a pit privy may pollute any water supply; or 
                  4.  Where the use of pit privies is not in keeping with the standard of sanitation in adjacent areas. 
                  l.  Any premise that has a septic tank, privy, or any other sewage, industrial waste, or liquid waste disposal system located thereon, that does not function in a sanitary manner, shall be corrected within 30 days from the receipt of written notification from the health officer and said system is not functioning in a sanitary manner, and order that said system be corrected. All homes, apartments, and businesses which are connected to the city's sewerage system shall be equipped with a backflow prevention device to be installed in their sewer lines between the source of sewerage and the city sewer collection system or sewer service lateral which services their home, apartment, place of business, or structure which is connected to the city's sewer collection system. 
                  1.  The backflow prevention device must be of a type approved by the city building inspector and shall be installed by a state licensed plumber and inspected by the city building inspector. Each property owner shall secure from the building inspector a form or certificate stating that it has been inspected and that the device meets standard requirements as to a backflow protection device. 
                  2.  It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to maintain such backflow prevention device and keep it operational. 
                  3.  It is not mandatory to install such a device in an existing system; however, the failure to do so will release the city of any damage resulting from sewerage backing up into any home, place of business, or any structure connected to the city sewer collection system which does not have an approved backflow device. 
                  m.  Premises with private water systems shall not be connected with the public sewerage system. 
                  n.  No statement contained in this article shall be construed to interfere with any additional requirements that may be imposed by the Burke County health officer. 
                  (2)  Building sewers and connections. 
                  a.  No unauthorized person shall uncover, make connections with or opening into, use, alter, or disturb the public sewer or appurtenance thereof without first obtaining a written permit from the city building inspector.

                  c.  All costs and expenses incidental to the installation, repair and connection of the building sewer shall be paid for by the owner. The property owner is responsible for all costs and expenses for all portions of the sewer line measured from the tap to the residence, building or dwelling. The owner shall indemnify the city from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the building sewer. 
                  d.  A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every building; except where one building stands at the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard, or driveway; the front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building sewer. The city or the appointed agency does not and will not assume any obligation or responsibility for damage caused by or resulting from any such single connection aforementioned. 
                  e.  Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test by the building inspector, to meet all requirements of this article. 
                  f.  The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building sewer and the methods to be used in construction shall all conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of the county. In the absence of code provisions or in amplification thereof, the materials and procedures set forth in appropriate specifications thereof, the materials and procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and Water Pollution Control Federation (WPCF) Manual of Practice No. 9 shall apply. Additionally, the following materials and methods shall apply to building sewers within the city's supervision: 
                  1.  The building sewer shall be cast iron soil pipe, ASTM Specification A74, latest revision, or equal; ductile iron pipe, American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Specification A21.51, latest revision, or equal; or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sewer pipe, ASTM Specification D3034, latest revision. All joints shall be tight and waterproof. Any part of the building sewer that is located within ten feet of a water service pipe shall be constructed of cast iron pipe, or ductile iron pipe with bolted mechanical joints as may be required by the building inspector where the sewer is exposed to damage by tree roots. If installed in filled or unstable ground, the building sewer shall be of cast iron pipe, except that plastic pipe may be acceptable if laid on a suitable concrete bed or cradle as approved by the building inspector. 
                  2.  The size and slope of the building sewer shall be subject to the approval of the city manager, but in no event shall the diameter be less than four inches. The slope of such four inch pipe shall not be less than one-eighth inch per foot. Furthermore, the appropriate requirements of the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OSHA) shall be followed. 
                  3.  The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost, and the building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and with straight alignment insofar as possible. Changes in direction shall be made only with properly curved pipe and fittings. Building sewers shall not be placed in the same trench with water service lines. 
                  4.  An excavation required for the installation of a building sewer shall be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the city building inspector. Pipe laying and backfill shall be performed in accordance with ASTM Specification C12, latest revision, except that no backfill shall be placed until the work has been inspected and approved. 
                  5.  All joints and connections shall be made gas-tight and watertight. 
                  (i)  Push-on joints for cast iron pipe shall have neoprene gaskets in accordance with the requirements of ASTM C-564. 
                  (ii)  Push-on joints for ductile iron pipe shall also have neoprene gaskets and be installed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 
                  (iii)  PVC pipe joint material shall be of the bell and spigot type, sealed with a rubber O-ring gasket, having a composition and texture which is resistant to the common ingredients of sewerage, industrial wastes (including oils), and groundwater, and which will endure permanently under the conditions likely to be imposed by this use. Installation of gasket shall be done in accordance with the pipe manufacturer's instructions using all the necessary materials, lubricants, and equipment recommended by the manufacturer. 
                  (iv)  Other jointing materials may be used only when approved by the building inspector. 
                  6.  The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the "Y" branch, if such a branch is available at a suitable location. If the public sewer is 12 inches in diameter or less, and no properly located "Y" branch is available, the city shall, at the owner's expense, cut a neat hole into the public sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at an angle of about 45 degrees, and install a 45 degree elbow with the spigot end cut so as not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. A neat smooth joint shall be made, and the connection made secure and watertight by encasement in concrete. Special fittings may be used for the connection only when approved by the building inspector. 
                  g.  Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within three feet of any bearing wall that might thereby be weakened. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the building sewer. 
                  h.  No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, foundation drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain that in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sewer unless such connection is approved for purposes of disposal or polluted surface drainage. 
                  i.  The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the building inspector when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. The connection and testing shall be made under the supervision of the building inspector or his representative. 
                  j.  All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the city. 
                  k.  The city or the appointed agency will define the availability of sewers and any costs associated with sewer permits or construction. 
                  l.  The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of the city or the procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the ASTM and the WPCF Manual of Practice No. 9. All such connections shall be made gas-tight and watertight and verified by proper testing. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by the building inspector before installation. 
                  m.  In the event a house sewer permits the entrance of infiltration or inflow, the city or its appointed agency may: 
                  1.  Require the owner to repair the house sewer; 
                  2.  Charge the owner a sewer rate that reflects the costs of the additional expense of sewage treatment from the owner's property; 
                  3.  Require the owner to disconnect his sewer from the city sewer system. 
                  (3)  Restricted use of the public sewers. 
                  a.  If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated above and which, in the judgment of the city, may have a deleterious effect upon the wastewater facilities, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the city may: 
                  1.  Reject the wastes; 
                  2.  Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers; 
                  3.  Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or 
                  4.  Require surcharge payment to cover added cost of handling and treating the wastes. 
                  b.  No person shall dispose of human excrement except in a toilet.

                  (1)  Any user that is discharging 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes as defined in 40 CFR 261 (listed or characteristic wastes) in a calendar month or any facility discharging any amount of acutely hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e) is required to provide a one time notification in writing to the city, EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, Georgia Environmental Protection Division Director. Any existing user exempt from this notification shall comply with the requirements contained herein within 30 days of becoming aware of a discharge of 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes in a calendar month or the discharge of acutely hazardous wastes to the city sewer system. 
                  (2)  Such notification shall include: 
                  a.  The name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261; 
                  b.  The EPA hazardous waste number; and 
                  c.  The type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other); 
                  d.  If an industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar per month to the sewer system, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent it is known or readily available to the industrial user: 
                  1.  An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes; 
                  2.  An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste streams discharged during that calendar month; and 
                  3.  An estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste streams expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. 
                  (3)  These notification requirements do not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements. 
                  (4)  Whenever the EPA publishes final rules identifying additional hazardous wastes or new characteristics of hazardous waste, a user shall notify the city of the discharge of such a substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
                  (5)  In the case of any notification made under this subsection (e), an industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
                  (f)  Notice of potential problems, including accidental spills, slug loadings. Any user shall notify the city immediately of all discharges that could cause problems to the POTW, including any slug loadings, as defined in section 114-176(c). The notification shall include the concentration and volume and corrective action. Steps being taken to reduce any adverse impact should also be noted during the notification. Any user who discharges a "slug" (or slugs) of pollutants shall be liable for any expense, loss, or damage to the POTW, in addition to the amount of any fines imposed on the city under state or federal law. 
                  (g)  Noncompliance reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the city within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling within five days and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the city within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation, except the user is not required to resample if: 
                  (1)  The city performs sampling at the user at a frequency of at least once per month; or 
                  (2)  The city performs sampling at the user between the time when the user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
                  (h)  Notification of changed discharge. All users shall promptly notify the city manager in advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including significant manufacturing process changes, pretreatment modifications, and the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the user has submitted initial notification under 40 CFR 403.12(p). 
                  (i)  Total toxic organic (TTO) reporting. Categorical users which are required by EPA to eliminate and/or reduce the levels of total toxic organics (TTOs) discharged into the sewer system must follow the categorical pretreatment standards for that industry. Those users must also meet the following requirements: 
                  (1)  Must sample without exception, as part of the application requirements, for all the organics listed under the TTO limit. 
                  (2)  No TTO's used at the facility or the user elects to develop a solvent management plan in lieu of continuously monitoring for TTO. 
                  (3)  The user must routinely submit a certification statement as part of its self-monitoring report that there has been no dumping of concentrated toxic organic into the wastewater and that it is implementing a solvent management plan as approved by the city. Facilities who have sampled initially and can verify that there are no toxic organics utilized may not have to develop a solvent management plan, but must make the certification statement of no use of toxic organics during the reporting period. 
                  (j)  Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the city as the city manager may require. 
                  (k)  Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the name of the persons taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or POTW, or when the city manager specifically notifies a user of a longer retention period. 
                  (Ord. No. 2002-02-01, § 4, 8-5-2002) 
                  Sec. 114-180. - Sampling and analytical requirements. 
                  (a)  Sampling requirements for users. 
                  (1)  A minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics. The city manager will determine on a case-by-case basis whether the user will be able to composite the individual grab samples. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The city may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any user that demonstrates that flow-proportional is infeasible. In such cases, samples may be obtained through time-proportional composite sampling techniques or through a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. 
                  (2)  Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exists or immediately downstream from the regulated or manufacturing process if no pretreatment exists or as determined by the city and contained in the user's wastewater discharge permit. For categorical users, if other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standards. For other SIUs, for which the city has adjusted its local limits to factor out dilution flows, the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to evaluate compliance with the adjusted pretreatment standards. 
                  (3)  All sample results shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges from the user. If a user sampled and analyzed more frequently than what was required in its wastewater discharge permit, using methodologies in 40 CFR 136, it must submit all results of sampling and analysis of the discharge as part of its self-monitoring report. 
                  (b)  Analytical requirements. All pollutants analyses, including sampling techniques, shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA. 
                  (c)  City monitoring of user's wastewater. The city will follow the same procedures as outlined in subsections (a) and (b) of this section. 
                  (Ord. No. 2002-02-01, § 5, 8-5-2002) 
                  Sec. 114-181. - Compliance monitoring. 
                  (a)  Inspections and sampling. The city shall have the right to enter the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this article, and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, is being met and whether the user is complying with all requirements thereof. Users shall allow the city manager and his designees ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
                  (1)  Where a user has security measures in force, which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the city manager or designee will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
                  (2)  The city manager or designee shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations. 
                  (3)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the city manager and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user. 
                  (4)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the city manager or designee access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this article. 
                  (b)  Monitoring facilities. 
                  (1)  Each user shall provide and operate at its own expense a monitoring facility to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurements of each sewer discharge to the city. Each monitoring facility shall be situated on the user's premises, except where such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the city may concur with the facility being constructed in the public street or sidewalk area, providing that the facility is located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. The city manager, whenever applicable, may require the construction and maintenance of sampling facilities at other locations (e.g., at the end of a manufacturing line, wastewater treatment system). 
                  (2)  There shall be ample room in or near such sampling facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. 
                  (3)  All monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with all applicable local construction standards and specifications. 
                  (4)  The city manager may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
                  (c)  Search warrants. If the city manager or designee has been refused access to a building, structure or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect as part of a routine inspection program of the city designed to verify compliance with this article or any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the city manager shall seek issuance of a search warrant from the Superior Court of Burke County or other appropriate court. Such warrant shall be served at reasonable hours by the city manager in the company of a uniformed police officer of the city.

                  Sec. 117-182. - Confidential information. 
                  Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from city inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction.

                  Sec. 114-183. - Publication of users in significant noncompliance. 
                  The city shall publish annually, in the local legal organ published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the users, which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term "significant noncompliance" shall mean: 
                  (1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount; 
                  (2)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria. This does not include measurements for pH; 
                  (3)  Any other discharge violation that the city believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of city personnel or the general public; 
                  (4)  Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the city's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
                  (5)  Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
                  (6)  Failure to provide, within 30 days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
                  (7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
                  (8)  Any other violations the city determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.

                  Sec. 114-184. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
                  (a)  Notification of violation. When the city manager or his designee finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city manager may serve upon that user a written notice of violation (NOV). The NOV will require, within 15 days, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, to be submitted by the user to the city manager within a prescribed period of time. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
                  (b)  Consent orders. The city manager may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to subsections (d) and (e) of this section and shall be judicially enforceable. Use of a consent order shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
                  (c)  Show cause meeting. The city manager may order a user which has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the city manager and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least five days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause meeting shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
                  (d)  Compliance orders. When the city manager finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city manager may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a time specified in the order. If the user does not come into compliance within the time specified in the order, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders may also contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
                  (e)  Cease and desist. 
                  (1)  When the city manager finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the city manager may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
                  a.  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
                  b.  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
                  (2)  Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
                  (f)  Administrative fines. 
                  (1)  When the city manager finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city manager may fine such user in an amount established by council, but not to exceed $1,000.00. The basis for such fines shall be assessed per violation, per day. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
                  (2)  Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 90 calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of seven percent of the unpaid balance. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties. 
                  (3)  Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the city manager to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within 14 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the city manager shall convene a hearing on the matter within 14 days of receiving the request from the user. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The city may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. 
                  (4)  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
                  (g)  Emergency suspensions. 
                  (1)  The city manager may immediately suspend a user's discharge (after informal notice to the user) whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The city manager may also immediately suspend a user's discharge (after notice and opportunity to respond) that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents or may present an endangerment to the environment. 
                  a.  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city manager shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The city manager shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in subsection (h) of this section are initiated against the user. 
                  b.  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the city manager prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under subsections (c) and (h) of this section. 
                  (2)  Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
                  (h)  Termination of discharge (non-emergency). 
                  (1)  Any user that violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
                  a.  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
                  b.  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
                  c.  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge; 
                  d.  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or 
                  e.  Violation of the pretreatment standards in section 114-177. 
                  (2)  Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under subsection (c) of this section why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the city shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

                  Sec. 114-185. - Judicial enforcement remedies. 
                  (a)  Injunctive relief. When the city manager finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city manager may petition the Superior Court of Burke County through the city's attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this article on activities of the user. The city may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
                  (b)  Civil penalties. 
                  (1)  A user which has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, shall be liable to the city for a maximum civil penalty of $1,000.00 per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. 
                  (2)  The city manager may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city. 
                  (3)  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
                  (4)  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
                  (c)  Criminal prosecution. 
                  (1)  A user which has willfully or negligently violated any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than six months, or both. 
                  (2)  A user which has willfully or negligently introduced any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be subject to a penalty of at least $1,000.00 and/or be subject to imprisonment for six months. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law. 
                  (3)  A user which knowingly made any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this article, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsified, tampered with, or knowingly rendered inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article, shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for six months, or both. 
                  (4)  In the event of a second conviction, a user shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 per violation per day, or imprisonment for six months, or both. 
                  (d)  Remedies non-exclusive. The provisions in sections 114-183 through 114-186 are not exclusive remedies. The city reserves the right to take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response plan. However, the city reserves the right to take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the city is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. These actions may be taken concurrently.

                  (a)  Upset. 
                  (1)  For the purposes of this section, the term "upset," means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
                  (2)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (a)(3) of this section are met. 
                  (3)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
                  a.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause of the upset; 
                  b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
                  c.  The user has submitted the following information to the POTW and treatment plant operator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days: 
                  1.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
                  2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times, or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
                  3.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
                  (4)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
                  (5)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards. 
                  (6)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with applicable pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
                  (b)  Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the prohibitions in section 114-177(a)(1) and (2)c through g if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
                  (1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
                  (2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES and/or other disposal system permit, and, in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
                  (c)  Bypass. 
                  (1)  For the purposes of this section: 
                  a.  The term "bypass" means the intentional division of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
                  b.  The term "severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities that causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources that can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
                  (2)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause applicable pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c)(3) and (4) of this section. 
                  (3)  a.  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
                  b.  a.  Bypass is prohibited, and the city may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
                  1.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
                  2.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
                  3.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (3) of this section. 
                  b.  The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (c)(4)a of this section.
