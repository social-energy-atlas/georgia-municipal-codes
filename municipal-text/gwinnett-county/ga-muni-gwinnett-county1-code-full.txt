PREFACE 
This Code constitutes recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of Gwinnett County, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1994 Code, as amended through September 22, 2015, and ordinances adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1994 Code, as amended, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Ramona Connors, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to the county attorney's office for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the county readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the county's affairs.

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note— This part was created by County resolution adopted on first reading on September 2, 1986, and on second reading on September 16, 1986, which resolution is found in 1987 Ga. Laws, page 5543. Such resolution added a part I commencing with section 25 to 1968 Ga. Laws (Act No. 612), page 2003. Because in prior county codes this resolution was not published as a part of the 1968 act, it is assumed that the amendment made to the act by 1988 Ga. Laws (Act No. 1039), page 4658, did not repeal these provisions. Amendments are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original. Catchlines have been editorially supplied. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. Other additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets.

Such revenue bonds or obligations shall be issued pursuant to, and in conformity with, the Revenue Bond Law [(O.C.G.A. § 36-82-60 et seq.)], approved March 31, 1937 (1937 Ga.

The Authority shall determine the form of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest thereof, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the State. The bonds may be issued in coupon or registered form, or both. The Authority may make provisions for the registration of any coupon bond, as to principal alone, or to both the principal and interest. 
Sec. 10. - Signatures; seal. 
In case any officer whose signature shall appear on any bonds, or whose facsimile signature shall appear on any coupon, shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. All such bonds shall be signed by the Chairman of the Authority and attested by the Secretary-Treasurer of the Authority, and the official seal of the Authority shall be affixed thereto. Any coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signatures of the Chairman and Secretary-Treasurer of the Authority. Any bond may be signed, sealed and attested on behalf of the Authority by such persons as shall be duly authorized or hold the proper office, at the actual time of the execution of such bonds, although such persons may not have been so authorized or shall not have held such office on the date of delivery and payment of such bonds. 
Sec. 11. - Negotiability; exemption from taxation. 
All revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall have, and are hereby declared to have, all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the negotiable instruments law of the State. Such bonds are declared to be issued for an essential public and governmental purpose, and the said bonds, their transfer, and the income thereof shall be exempt from all taxation within the State. 
Sec. 12. - Sale price. 
The Authority may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interest of the Authority, but no such sale shall be made at a price less than par, as provided in the Revenue Bond Law, unless said Revenue Bond Law be hereafter amended to permit the sale of such bonds at less than par. 
Sec. 13. - Proceeds of bonds. 
The proceeds of such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project or projects, and unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of any deficit for the cost of the project or projects, which, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purposes. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such bonds are issued, the surplus shall be paid into a sinking fund or used for additional construction as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture. 
Sec. 14. - Interim receipts and certificates or temporary bonds. 
Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts, interim certificates or temporary bonds, with or without coupons exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter.

The Authority may also provide for the replacement of any bond which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost. 
Sec. 16. - Conditions precedent to issuance; object of issuance. 
Such revenue bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions and things which are specified or required by this act. In the discretion of the Authority, revenue bonds of a single issue may be issued for the purpose of any particular project. Any resolution, providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this act, shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at regular, special, or adjourned meeting of the Authority by a majority vote of the quorum as provided in this act. 
Sec. 17. - Credit not pledged. 
Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of Gwinnett County. Such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund hereinafter provided for, and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly or contingently obligate said county to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for the payment of such bonds. All such bonds shall contain recitals on their face substantially covering the foregoing provisions of this section. 
Sec. 18. - Trust indenture as security. 
In the discretion of the Authority any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the Authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the State. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues and earnings to be received by the Authority, including the proceeds derived from the sale of any surplus property of the Authority, both real and personal. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the Authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair and insurance of the property, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all monies, including the proceeds derived from the sale of property of the Authority, both real and personal, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the Authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other monies be satisfactory to such purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this State to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the Authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the Authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project affected by such indenture. 
Sec. 19. - To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid. 
The Authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who, or any agency, bank or trust company, which shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as this act and such resolutions or trust indentures may provide. 
Sec. 20. - Sinking funds. 
The revenues, fees, tolls and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such fees, earnings and revenues were produced by a particular project for which bonds have been issued, and any monies derived from the sale of any properties, both real and personal, of the Authority, unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the Authority to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds of the Authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or the trust instrument may provide. Such funds so pledged from whatever source received, which said pledge may include funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals, as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture, into a sinking fund. Said sinking fund shall be pledged to and charged with the payments of (1) the interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due, (2) the principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due, (3) the necessary charges of paying agent or agents for paying interest and principal, and (4) any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as hereinabove provided. The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be a fund for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, surplus monies in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds, and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be cancelled and shall not again be issued. 
Sec. 21. - Remedies of bondholders. 
Any holder of revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Georgia or granted hereunder or under such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this act or by such resolution or trust indenture, to be performed by the Authority, or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished. 
Sec. 22. - Refunding bonds. 
The Authority is hereby authorized to provide by resolution for the issuance of revenue refunding bonds issued under the provisions of this act and then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon.

Sec. 23. - Validation. 
Bonds of the Authority shall be confirmed and validated in accordance with the procedures of the Revenue Bond Law. The petition for validation shall also make any municipality, county, authority, subdivision or instrumentality of the State of Georgia or the United States Government or any department or agency of the United States Government, if subject to be sued, which has contracted with the Authority for the services and facilities of the project for which bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated, a party-defendant to such action. Such municipality, county, authority, subdivision or instrumentality shall be required to show cause, if any, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the court and the validity of the terms thereof be determined and the contract or contracts adjudicated as security for the payment of any such bonds of the Authority. The bonds, when validated, and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds, against the Authority issuing the same, and any municipality, county, authority, subdivision or instrumentality of the United States Government if a party to the validation proceedings, contracting with the Gwinnett County Airport Authority. 
Sec. 24. - Venue and jurisdiction. 
Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this act or any suit or action against such Authority shall be brought in the Superior Court of Gwinnett County, Georgia, and any action pertaining to validation of any bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall likewise be brought in said court, which shall have original jurisdiction of such actions. 
Sec. 25. - Interest of bondholders protected. 
While any of the bonds issued by the Authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties or existence of said Authority or of its officers, employees or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will adversely affect the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds, and no other entity, department, agency or authority shall be created which will compete with the Authority to such an extent as to adversely affect the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds, nor will the State itself so compete with the Authority. The provisions of this act shall be for the benefit of the State, the Authority and the holders of any such bonds, and upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions hereof, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds. 
Sec. 26. - Monies considered trust funds.

Sec. 7. - Same—Signatures; seal. 
All such bonds shall be signed by the Chairman of the Authority and attested by the Secretary and Treasurer of the Authority and the official seal of the Authority shall be affixed thereto and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signatures of the Chairman and Secretary and Treasurer of the Authority. Any coupon may bear the facsimile signatures of such persons and any bond may be signed, sealed and attested on behalf of the Authority by such persons as at the actual time of the execution of such bonds shall be duly authorized or hold the proper office, although at the date of such bonds such persons may not have been so authorized or shall not have held such office. In case any officer whose signature shall appear on any bonds or whose facsimile signature shall appear on any coupon shall cease to be such officer before delivery of such bonds, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. 
Sec. 8. - Same—Negotiability; exemption from taxation. 
All revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall have and are hereby declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under laws of the State. Such bonds are declared to be issued for an essential public and governmental purpose and the said bonds and the income thereof shall be exempt from all taxation within the State.

Sec. 13. - Credit not pledged.

Sec. 14. - Trust indenture as security. 
In the discretion of the Authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the Authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the State. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues and earnings to be received by the Authority, including the proceeds derived from the sale from time to time of any surplus property of the Authority, both real and personal. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the Authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair and insurance of the project, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all monies, including the proceeds derived from the sale of property of the Authority, both real and personal, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the Authority, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this State to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the Authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the Authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project affected by such indenture. 
Sec. 15. - To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid. 
The Authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who or any agency, bank or trust company which shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as this act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide.

The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be maintained as a trust account for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture any surplus monies in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be cancelled and shall not be reissued, printed and delivered. 
Sec. 17. - Remedies of bondholders. 
Any holder of revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Georgia or granted hereunder or under such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this act or by such resolution or trust indenture, to be performed by the Authority, or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished.

Sec. 19. - Venue and jurisdiction.

Sec. 20. - Validation.

The petition for validation shall also make party defendant to such action the State of Georgia or any municipality, county, authority, political subdivision or instrumentality of the State of Georgia or the United States Government or any department or agency of the United States Government, if subject to being sued and if consenting to same, which has contracted with the Authority for the services and facilities of the project for which bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated and the State or such municipality, county, authority, political subdivision or instrumentality shall be required to show cause, if any, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the Court and the validity of the terms thereof be determined and the contract or contracts adjudicated as a part of the basis of the security for the payment of any such bonds of the Authority.

Sec. 21. - Interest of bondholders protected. 
While any of the bonds issued by the Authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties or existence of said Authority or of its officers, employees or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds, and no other entity, department, agency or Authority will be created which will compete with the Authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds, nor will the State itself so compete with the Authority.

The principal of and interest on such revenue bonds shall be payable solely from the special fund herein provided for such payment.

Such revenue bonds or obligations shall be issued pursuant to and in conformity with the Revenue Bond Law (1957 Ga. Laws, page 36 et seq.), as amended [(O.C.G.A. § 36-82-60 et seq.)], amending the law formerly known as the Revenue Certificate Law of 1937 (1937 Ga.

The authority shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest thereof, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the state. The bonds may be issued in coupon or registered form, or both, as the authority may determine and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bond as to principal alone and also as to both the principal and interest. 
Sec. 7. - Same—Signatures; seal. 
All such bonds shall be signed by the chairman of the authority and attested by the secretary and treasurer of the authority and the official seal of the authority shall be affixed thereto and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signatures of the chairman and secretary and treasurer of the authority. Any coupon may bear the facsimile signatures of such persons and any bond may be signed, sealed and attested on behalf of the authority by such persons as at the actual time of the execution of such bonds shall be duly authorized or hold the proper office; although at the date of such bonds such persons may not have been so authorized or shall not have held such office. In case any officer whose signature shall appear on any bonds or whose facsimile signature shall appear on any coupon shall cease to be such officer before delivery of such bonds, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. 
Sec. 8. - Same—Negotiability; exemption from taxation. 
All revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall have and are hereby declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under laws of the state. Such bonds are declared to be issued for an essential public and governmental purpose and the said bonds and the income thereof shall be exempt from all taxation within the state. 
Sec. 9. - Same—Sale; proceeds. 
The authority may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interest of the authority and the proceeds derived from the sale of such bonds shall be used solely for the purpose provided in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of such bonds. 
Sec. 10. - Same—Interim receipts and certificates or temporary bonds. 
Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the authority may, under like restrictions issue interim receipts, interim certificates or temporary bonds, with or without coupons exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter. 
Sec. 11. - Same—Replacement of lost or mutilated bonds. 
The authority may also provide for the replacement of any bond or any coupons which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost. 
Sec. 12. - Same—Conditions precedent to issuance. 
Such revenue bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions and things which are specified or required by this act. Any resolution, providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this act shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special or adjourned meeting of the authority by a majority of its members. 
Sec. 13. - Credit not pledged. 
Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of Gwinnett County, nor a pledge of the faith and credit of said county; but such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund hereinafter provided for and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly or contingently obligate the said county to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment, and all such bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this section. 
Sec. 14. - Trust indenture as security. 
In the discretion of the authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues and earnings to be received by the authority, including, the proceeds derived from the sale from time to time of any surplus property of the authority, both real and personal. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property; the construction of the project; the maintenance, operation, repair and insurance of the project, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all monies, including the proceeds derived from the sale of property of the authority, both real and personal, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project affected by such indenture. 
Sec. 15. - To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid. 
The authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who, or any agency, bank or trust company which, shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as this act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide. 
Sec. 16. - Sinking fund. 
The revenues, fees, tolls, and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such fees, earnings and revenues were produced by a particular project for which bonds have been issued and any monies derived from the sale of any properties, both real and personal of the authority, unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the authority to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds of the authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust instrument may provide, and such funds so pledged from whatever source received, which said pledge may include funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture, into a sinking fund which said sinking fund shall be pledged to and charged with the payment of (1) the interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due, (2) the principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due, (3) any premium upon bonds acquired by redemption, payment or otherwise, and (4) the necessary charges of the paying agent or agents for paying principal and interest, and (5) any investment fees or charges. The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be maintained as a trust account for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture any surplus monies in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be cancelled and shall not be reissued, printed and delivered. 
Sec. 17. - Remedies of bondholders. 
Any holder of revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Georgia or granted hereunder or under such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this act or by such resolution or trust indenture, to be performed by the authority, or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished. 
Sec. 18. - Refunding bonds. 
The authority is hereby authorized to provide by resolution for the issuance of bonds of the authority for the purpose of funding or refunding any revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act and then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and premium, if any. The issuance of such funding or refunding bonds, the maturities and all other details thereof, the rights of the holder thereof, and the duties of the authority in respect to the same, shall be governed by the foregoing provisions of this act insofar as the same may be applicable. 
Sec. 19. - Venue and jurisdiction. 
Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this act or any suit or action against such authority shall be brought in the Superior Court of Gwinnett County, Georgia, and any action pertaining to validation of any bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall likewise be brought in said court which shall have exclusive, original jurisdiction of such actions. 
Sec. 20. - Validation. 
Bonds of the authority shall be confirmed and validated in accordance with the procedure of the Revenue Bond Law, as amended. The petition for validation shall also make party defendant to such action the State of Georgia or any municipality, county, authority, political subdivision or instrumentality of the State of Georgia or the United States Government or any department or agency of the United States Government, if subject to being sued and if consenting to same, which has contracted with the authority for the services and facilities of the project for which bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated and the state or such municipality, county, authority, political subdivision or instrumentality shall be required to show cause, if any, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the court and the validity of the terms thereof be determined and the contract or contracts adjudicated as part of the basis of the security for the payment of any such bonds of the authority.

Sec. 21. - Interest of bondholders protected. 
While any of the bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties or existence of said authority or of its officers, employees or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds, and no other entity, department, agency or authority will be created which will compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds, nor will the state itself so compete with the authority. The provisions of this act shall be for the benefit of the authority and the holders of any such bonds, and upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions hereof, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds. 
Sec. 22. - Moneys received considered trust funds.

The Authority shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of the principal thereof and the interest thereon, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the State. The bonds may be issued in coupon or registered form, or both, as the Authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bond as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest. 
Sec. 7. - Same—Signatures; seal. 
In case any officer whose signature shall appear on any bonds or whose facsimile signature shall appear on any coupon shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if such officer had remained in office until such delivery. All such bonds shall be signed by the chairman of the Authority and official seal of the Authority shall be affixed thereto and attested by the secretary and treasurer of the Authority and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signatures of the chairman and secretary and treasurer of the Authority. Any coupon may bear the facsimile signatures of such persons and any bond may be signed, sealed and attested on behalf of the Authority by such persons as at the actual time of the execution of such bonds shall be duly authorized or hold the proper office, although at the date of such bonds such persons may not have been so authorized or shall not have held such office. 
Sec. 8. - Same—Negotiability; exemption from taxation. 
All revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall have and are hereby declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the laws of the State. Such bonds, their transfer and the income thereof shall be exempt from all taxation within the State. 
Sec. 9. - Same—Sale; proceeds. 
The Authority may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interest of the Authority and the proceeds derived from the sale of such bonds shall be used solely for the purpose provided in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of such bonds. 
Sec. 10. - Same—Interim receipts and certificates or temporary bonds. 
Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Authority may, under like restrictions issue interim receipts, interim certificates or temporary bonds, with or without coupons exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter.

Any resolution, providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this act shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special or adjourned meeting of the Authority by a majority of its members. 
Sec. 13. - Credit not pledged. 
Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of Gwinnett County nor a pledge of the faith and credit of said county, but such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund hereinafter provided for and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly or contingently obligate said county to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment, and all such bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this section. 
Sec. 14. - Trust indenture as security. 
In the discretion of the Authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the Authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the State. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues and earnings to be received by the Authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the Authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair and insuring of the project, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all monies, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the Authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor, and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depositary of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this State to act as such depositary and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the Authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the Authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project affected by such indenture. 
Sec. 15. - To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid. 
The Authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who or any agency, bank or trust company which shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as this act and such resolutions or trust indentures may provide. 
Sec. 16. - Sinking fund. 
The revenues, fees, tolls and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such fees, earnings, and revenues were produced by a particular project for which bonds have been issued unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the Authority to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds of the Authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust instrument may provide, and such funds so pledged from whatever source received, which said pledge may include funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture, into a sinking fund which said sinking fund shall be pledged to and charged with the payment of (1) the interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due, (2) the principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due, (3) the necessary charges of paying agents for paying principal and interest and other investment charges, and (4) any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as hereinabove provided. The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be maintained as a trust account for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture any surplus monies in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be cancelled and shall not again be issued. 
Sec. 17. - Remedies of bondholders. 
Any holder of revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Georgia or granted hereunder or under such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this act or by such resolution or trust indenture, to be performed by the Authority, or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished. 
Sec. 18. - Refunding bonds.

The issuance of such funding or refunding bonds, the maturities and all other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof, and the duties of the Authority in respect to the same, shall be governed by the foregoing provisions of this act insofar as the same may be applicable. 
Sec. 19. - Validation. 
Bonds of the Authority shall be confirmed and validated in accordance with the procedure of the Revenue Bond Law, as amended. The petition for validation shall also make party defendant to such action the State of Georgia or any municipality, county, authority, political subdivision or instrumentality of the State of Georgia which has contracted with the Authority for the services and facilities of the project for which bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated and the State or such municipality, county, authority, political subdivision or instrumentality shall be required to show cause, if any exist, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the court and the contract or contracts adjudicated as a part of the basis of the security for the payment of any such bonds of the Authority. The bonds when validated, and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds and the security for the payment thereof and interest thereon and against the Authority issuing the same, and the State and any municipality, county, authority, political subdivision or instrumentality if a party to the validation proceedings, contracting with the said Gwinnett County Water and Sewerage Authority.

While any of the bonds issued by the Authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties or existence of said Authority or of its officers, employees or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of such bonds, and no other entity, department, agency or authority will be created which will compete with the Authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of such bonds, nor will the State itself so compete with the Authority. The provisions of this act shall be for the benefit of the Authority and the holders of any such bonds, and upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions hereof, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds. 
Sec. 22. - Moneys received considered trust funds. 
All moneys received pursuant to the authority of this act, whether as proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds, as grants or other contributions, or as revenues, income, fees and earnings, shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided in this act.

In case any officer whose signature shall appear on any bonds or whose signature shall appear on any coupon shall cease to be such officer before delivery of such bonds, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he or she had remained in office until such delivery. 
Sec. 7. - Revenue bonds; negotiability; exemption from taxation. 
All revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall have and are declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under laws of this state. Such bonds are declared to be issued for an essential public and governmental purpose and such bonds and the income thereof shall be exempt from all taxation within the state. 
Sec. 8. - Revenue bonds; sale; proceeds. 
The storm-water authority may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interest of the storm-water authority, and the proceeds derived from the sale of such bonds shall be used solely for the purpose provided in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of such bonds.

Any resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this act shall become effective immediately upon passage; and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special or adjourned meeting of the storm-water authority by a majority of its members. 
Sec. 12. - Credit not pledged. 
Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall not constitute a debt of Gwinnett County or any municipality in Gwinnett County, nor a pledge of the faith and credit of Gwinnett County or any such municipality, but such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund provided for in this act and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate Gwinnett County or any such municipality to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment, and all such bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this section. 
Sec. 13. - Trust indenture as security. 
In the discretion of the storm-water authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the storm-water authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company inside or outside of the state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues, and earnings to be received by the storm-water authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the storm-water authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair, and insurance of the project, and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys; and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the storm-water authority, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the storm-water authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the storm-water authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the project affected by such indenture. 
Sec. 14. - To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid. 
The storm-water authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who or any agency, bank, or trust company that shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes provided for in this act, subject to such regulations as this act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide. 
Sec. 15. - Sinking fund. 
The revenues, fees, tolls, and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such fees, earnings, and revenues were produced by a particular project for which bonds have been issued unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the storm-water authority to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds of the storm-water authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust instrument may provide, and such funds so pledged from whatever source received, which pledge may include funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture into a sinking fund, which sinking fund shall be pledged to and charged with the payment of: 
(1)  The interest on revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due; 
(2)  The principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due; 
(3)  Any premium upon bonds acquired by redemption, payment, or otherwise; 
(4)  The necessary charges of the paying agent or agents for paying principal and interest; and 
(5)  Any investment fees or charges. 
The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be maintained as a trust account for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, any surplus moneys in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be canceled and shall not be reissued, printed, or delivered. 
Sec. 16. - Remedies of bondholders. 
Any holder of revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights given by this act may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Georgia or granted by this act or under such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this act or by such resolution or trust indenture, to be performed by the storm-water authority, or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, fines, and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished. 
Sec. 17. - Refunding bonds. 
The storm-water authority is authorized to provide by resolution for the issuance of bonds of the storm-water authority for the purpose of funding or refunding any revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act and then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and premium, if any. The issuance of such funding or refunding bonds, the maturities and all other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof, and the duties of the storm-water authority with respect to the same shall be governed by the foregoing provisions of this act insofar as the same may be applicable. 
Sec. 18. - Venue and jurisdiction. 
Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this act or any suit or action against the storm-water authority shall be brought in the Superior Court of Gwinnett County, Georgia, and any action pertaining to validation of any bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall likewise be brought in such court, which shall have exclusive, original jurisdiction of such actions.

Bonds of the storm-water authority shall be confirmed and validated in accordance with the procedure of article 3 of chapter 82 of title 36 of the O.C.G.A., the "Revenue Bond Law [(O.C.G.A. § 36-82-60 et seq.)];" the petition for validation shall also make party defendant to such action the State of Georgia or any municipality, county, authority, political subdivision, or instrumentality of the State of Georgia that has contracted with the storm-water authority for the services and facilities of the project for which bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated and the state or such municipality, county, authority, political subdivision, or instrumentality shall be required to show cause, if any, why such contractor contracts and the terms and conditions thereof shall not be inquired into by the court and the validity of the terms thereof be determined and the contract or contracts adjudicated as a part of the basis of the security for the payment of any such bonds of the storm-water authority. The bonds, when validated, and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds and the security for the payment thereof and interest thereon and against the authority issuing the same, the state and any municipality, county, authority, political subdivision, or instrumentality thereof, if a party to the validation proceedings, contracting with the Gwinnett County Storm-water Authority. 
Sec. 20. - Interest of bondholders protected. 
(a)  While any of the bonds issued by the storm-water authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties, or existence of the storm-water authority or of its officers, employees, or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds, and no other entity, department, agency, or authority will be created that will compete with the storm-water authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds, nor will the state itself so compete with the storm-water authority. 
(b)  The provisions of this act shall be for the benefit of the storm-water authority and the holders of any such bonds and, upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions of this act, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds.

Sec. 23. - Tax exempt status of storm-water authority. 
The properties of the storm-water authority, both real and personal, are declared to be public properties used for the benefit and welfare of the people of the state and not for purposes of private or corporate benefit and income, and such properties and the storm-water authority shall be exempt from all taxes and special assessment of any city, county, or the state or any political subdivision thereof. 
Sec. 24. - Billing and collection. 
The storm-water authority shall include the rates, fees, tolls, and charges for the services, facilities, or commodities furnished by the authority on the general tax bill issued by the county. Said rates, fees, tolls, and charges levied to pay the cost of such storm-water services, facilities, and commodities shall be collected by the Gwinnett County Tax Commissioner in the same manner as taxes are collected. The storm-water authority shall have no authority to set rates, fees, tolls, or charges and any rate, fee, toll, or charge levied shall first be approved by the Board of Commissioners of Gwinnett County. 
Sec. 25. - Powers declared supplemental and additional. 
The foregoing sections of this act shall be deemed to provide an additional and alternative method for the doing of the things authorized by this act and shall be regarded as supplemental and additional to powers conferred by other laws and shall not be regarded as in derogation of any powers now existing.

[(O.C.G.A. § 36-82-60 et seq.)], the "Revenue Bond Law."

However, it being the purpose hereof that any request for jury trial in lieu of a bench trial as set forth in subsection (b) herein, shall not be construed to be a demand for trial under any applicable speedy trial statute.

When a request for jury trial is filed, the same shall not be withdrawn without the consent of the opposite party.

One board member shall be appointed by the governing authority of each municipality, if any portion of the district lies within the incorporated area of such municipality, three board members shall be elected by the vote of electors, and three members shall be elected by the vote of equity electors. The board shall be seven in number plus one for each member appointed by the governing authority of each municipality as provided above. The members representing the electors and equity electors shall be elected to serve in post positions 1 through 6, respectively. Each elected board member must receive a majority of the votes cast for the post for which he or she is a candidate.

The initial term of office for the members representing posts 1 and 4 shall be one year. The initial term of office for the members representing posts 2 and 5 shall be two years, and the initial term of office of the members representing posts 3 and 6 shall be three years. Thereafter, all terms of office shall be for three years, except the appointed board members who serve at the pleasure of the governing body which appointed them. 
(b)  The initial board members to be elected as provided above shall be elected in a caucus of electors which shall be held within 60 days after the adoption of the resolutions and obtaining the written consents herein provided at such time and place within the district as the Board of Commissioners of Gwinnett County, or governing body of the municipality if the district lies wholly within the incorporated area thereof, shall designate after notice thereof shall have been given to said electors by publishing same in the legal organ of Gwinnett County as hereinafter provided. Thereafter, there shall be conducted, not later than 60 days following the last day for filing ad valorem real property tax returns in Gwinnett County, a caucus of said electors at such time and place within the district as the board shall designate in such notice for the purpose of electing board members to those board member positions whose terms expire or are vacant. If a vacancy occurs in an elected position on the board, the board shall, within 60 days thereof, call a special election to fill the same to be held within 60 days of the call unless such vacancy occurs within 180 days of the next regularly scheduled election, in which case a special election may, but need not, be called. For any election held hereunder, notice thereof shall be given to said electors by publishing notice thereof in the legal organ of Gwinnett County at least once each week for four weeks prior to such election.

(4)  Upon petition of either a majority of the electors within the district or a majority of the equity electors within the district, provided that, if the petition is for recall of an elected board member, the petition shall be from the category of voters who elected the board member; or 
(5)  Upon the termination of an agreement of cooperation. Termination is in the event such agreement of cooperation shall lapse (i.e., failure to reenact by the following December 31 after an existing agreement of cooperation shall expire on its own terms) or an affirmative resolution of rejection of an agreement or reenactment of an agreement of cooperation by any one of the necessary parties so that no agreement of cooperation is in force. 
(d)  Board members, including appointed board members, shall be electors within the district. If a board member ceases to be an elector, such board member's position shall be declared vacant as of the date of the event terminating such status. 
(e)  Board members shall receive no compensation for their services, but shall be reimbursed for actual expenses incurred in the performance of their duties. They shall elect one of their number as chairperson and another as vice chairperson. They shall also elect a secretary and a treasurer, or a secretary-treasurer, either of whom may, but need not, be a member of the board or an elector. 
(f)  If the boundaries of a district are subsequently changed after creation of the district to include land within a municipality which was not a party to the creation of the district, or if a municipality's boundaries are changed to include land within an existing district, the governing authority of the municipality shall acquire the right to appoint a member to the board of the district upon entering into the cooperation agreement provided for in section 9 hereof. If the boundaries of a district or municipality are subsequently changed after creation of a district to include land within the unincorporated area of Gwinnett County and the district originally had no land within the unincorporated area of Gwinnett County, the Board of Commissioners of Gwinnett County shall acquire the right to appoint a member to the board of the district upon entering into the cooperation agreement provided for in section 9 hereof. If, by municipal annexation or by deannexation of land from a district, the district no longer includes land within the unincorporated area of Gwinnett County or within a municipality, respectively, then the board member of the district appointed by such governing authority in which the district is no longer located shall cease to be a board member. 
(g)  Chapter 2 of title 21 of the O.C.G.A. [(O.C.G.A. § 21-2-1 et seq.)], the "Georgia Election Code," shall not apply to the election of district board members. The district board may adopt such bylaws not inconsistent herewith to provide for any matter concerning such elections. 
Sec. 6. - Taxes, fees, and assessments. 
(a)  The board may levy taxes, fees, and assessments within the district only on real property used nonresidentially, specifically excluding all property exempt from ad valorem taxation under the Constitution or laws of the State of Georgia, all property used for residential, agricultural, or forestry purposes, and all tangible personal property and intangible property. Any tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall not exceed 2.5 percent of the aggregate assessed value of all such real property. The taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board shall be equitably apportioned among the properties subject to such taxes, fees, and assessments according to the need for governmental services and facilities created by the degree of density of development of each such property. The proceeds of taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board shall be used only for the purpose of providing governmental services and facilities which are specially required by the degree of density of development within the district and not for the purpose of providing those governmental services and facilities provided to the county or municipality as a whole. Any tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall be collected by Gwinnett County in the same manner as taxes, fees, and assessments are levied by the county. Delinquent taxes shall bear the same interest and penalties as Gwinnett County ad valorem taxes and may be enforced and collected in the same manner. The proceeds of taxes, fees, and assessments so levied, less a fee to cover the costs of collection of 1 percent thereof, but not more than $25,000.00 in any one calendar year, shall be transmitted by Gwinnett County to the board and shall be expended by the board only for the purposes authorized hereby. 
(b)  The board shall levy the above-provided taxes subsequent to the report of the assessed taxable values for the current calendar year and notify in writing the collecting governing bodies so they may include the levy on their regular ad valorem tax bills, if possible. 
(c)  If, but for this provision, a parcel of real property is removed from a district or otherwise would become nontaxable, it shall continue to bear its tax millage then extant upon such event for bonded indebtedness of the district then outstanding until said bonded indebtedness then outstanding is paid or refunded. 
Sec. 7. - Boundaries of the districts. 
(a)  The boundaries of each district shall be as designated as such by the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners if wholly within the unincorporated area of Gwinnett County and such municipalities within which the district may be partially located if partially within the unincorporated area of Gwinnett County and partially within one or more municipalities, or by the governing authority of a municipality if wholly within the incorporated area thereof, as set forth in the resolutions required in section 4 hereof, or as may thereafter be added as hereinafter provided. 
(b)  The boundaries of a district may be increased after the initial creation of a district pursuant to the following: 
(1)  Written consent of a majority of the owners of real property within the area sought to be annexed and which will be subject to taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board of the district; 
(2)  Written consent of owners of real property within the area sought to be annexed which constitutes at least 75 percent by value of the property which will be subject to taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board. For this purpose, value shall be determined by the most recent approved county ad valorem tax digest; 
(3)  The adoption of a resolution consenting to the annexation by the board of the district; and 
(4)  The adoption of a resolution consenting to the annexation by the governing authorities of Gwinnett County, if any portion of the district is or is to be in the unincorporated area of Gwinnett County, and such municipalities as may have area within the district before or after the annexation. 
(c)  The boundaries of a district may also be increased after the initial creation of a district if: 
(1)  Written consent of the owners of any real property sought to be annexed and which will not be subject to taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board of the district is first obtained; 
(2)  The board of the district adopts a resolution consenting to the annexation; and 
(3)  A resolution is adopted which grants consent to the annexation by the governing authorities of Gwinnett County, if any portion of the district is in the unincorporated area of Gwinnett County, and such municipalities as may have area within the district before or after the annexation. 
(d)  Property which is not subject to taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board of the district and which is adjacent to, contiguous to, or abutting property within the district may be annexed by: 
(1)  The adoption of a resolution approving the annexation by the board of the district; and 
(2)  The adoption of a resolution granting consent to the annexation by the governing authorities of Gwinnett County, if any portion of the district is in the unincorporated area of Gwinnett County, and such municipalities as may have area within the district before or after the annexation. 
Sec. 8. - Debt. 
Except as otherwise provided in this section, each district may incur debt without regard to the requirements of article IX, section V of the Constitution of Georgia, or any other provision of law, prohibiting or restricting the borrowing of money or the creation of debt by political subdivisions of the State of Georgia, which debt shall be backed by the full faith and credit and taxing power of the district but shall not be an obligation of the State of Georgia or any other unit of government of the State of Georgia other than the district. No district shall be authorized to issue bonds or incur bonded indebtedness. 
Sec. 9. - Cooperation with local governments. 
The services and facilities provided pursuant hereto shall be provided for in a cooperation agreement executed jointly by the board, the governing body of Gwinnett County, and any municipalities within which the district is partially located. The provisions of this section shall in no way limit the authority of Gwinnett County or any such municipality to provide services or facilities within the district; and Gwinnett County or such municipalities shall retain full and complete authority and control over any of its facilities located within its respective areas of any district. Said control shall include but not be limited to the modification of, access to, and degree and type of services provided through or by facilities of the municipality or county. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to limit or preempt the application of any governmental laws, ordinances, resolutions, or regulations to the district or the services or facilities provided therein. Any community improvement district created pursuant to this act shall indemnify and hold harmless the State of Georgia, Gwinnett County, any municipality located wholly or partially within such community improvement district, and any other unit of government of the State of Georgia other than such community improvement district from any claim or cause of action asserted against, or which is capable of assertion against, such community improvement district arising from the acts or omissions of the community improvement district. Neither the State of Georgia, Gwinnett County, any municipality located wholly or partially within such district, nor any other unit of government of the State of Georgia other than the district shall be responsible or liable for payment of any sum arising from a claim or cause of action asserted, or which might have been asserted, against such community improvement district arising from the acts or omissions of the community improvement district.

Following the recommendation from the Municipal-Gwinnett County Planning Commission, the board of commissioners may ask questions concerning the planning commission's recommendation pertinent to the issue. 
(f)  The chairman shall then call for parties in interest on the matter who shall have privilege on the floor. The parties shall identify themselves by name, address and affiliation with any business or organization which would be relevant to the matter being considered. 
(g)  Proponents shall speak first; opponents shall speak second. All comments and questions from the parties in interest shall be directed to the board of commissioners. Proponents and opponents shall generally be provided ten minutes per side to present data, evidence, and opinions in support of their position. The chairman shall have the power and discretion to expand the period of time for presentation if, in his judgment, circumstances surrounding the matter warrant such action. Any unused portion of the allotted time may be used for rebuttal. In the event that there is more than one speaker per side, speakers must divide their time in order to complete their full presentation within the allotted time period. 
(h)  In the event that an official who represents a municipality or an agency of federal, state or local government wishes to speak on an agenda item, such official representative may be heard at the time established on the agenda for such matter and subject to the time limits set by the chairman. However, such time shall not reduce the time otherwise allotted to the proponents or opponents to present their public comments. 
(i)  Should the commissioners ask questions of an opponent, proponent or an official, the time taken to respond to questions will not take away from presentation time. 
(j)  The chairman shall call for questions from the board of commissioners to the proponents or opponents immediately after their individual presentation and before moving to the next speaker. 
(k)  When the questions or comments by the commissioners have been concluded, the chairman shall call for a motion for action on the issue before the board and a second of the motion. The chairman shall then call for discussion of the matter by the board of commissioners and voting thereon. 
(l)  Once discussion by the board of commissioners has begun, no further comment or presentation shall be made by parties in interest unless a commissioner has a specific question for a party in interest, the planning and development department staff, or the chairman deems further comment to be appropriate or germane to the issues surrounding the matter before the board of commissioners. Unless otherwise provided by law, a majority of affirmative votes by a quorum of the board of commissioners is required to pass any motion before the commission. 
(m)  Authorized action by the board of commissioners on zoning matters shall consist of the actions specified in UDO chapter 270. 
(n)  All items on an advertised agenda for a public hearing shall be heard on the scheduled date except if, in the judgment of a majority of the quorum of the board of commissioners, special circumstances surrounding the matter warrant the continuance of the hearing on the matter to a specific future date and time. 
(o)  The board of commissioners may table a vote on a specific matter to a specified future date and time after a public hearing. 
(p)  Prior to the presentation of zoning matters, the chairman shall announce the following: 
"I would like to remind those present that this is an official public meeting at which important business is conducted. The law department has advised the commissioners that audience outbursts, including applause, have been used by the courts to overturn zoning decisions. Therefore, I must ask you to refrain from applause and all abusive or unruly remarks and I will ask your cooperation to maintain an orderly meeting. 
Just two housekeeping procedures: Should you have the opportunity to come to the microphone to make a comment in support or opposition to any of the requests before us, I ask that you take a seat toward the front of the auditorium before the item you wish to address occurs on the agenda. When you come to the microphone to speak, I ask that you give your name and address for the record. The deputy clerk will be watching the time; ten minutes for presentation in support and ten minutes in opposition. Should the commissioners ask questions of you, that certainly does not take away from your presentation time." 
(q)  The rules of procedure shall be made available in written form to the public in the planning and development department, the office of the board of commissioners and at public hearings. 
(r)  Any person who wishes to speak in opposition to a rezoning application, who has made campaign contributions aggregating $250.00 or more to a local government official within the two-year period immediately preceding the filing of the application, must have provided a written disclosure of campaign contributions for the five-year period prior to the filing of the application. Such disclosure must have been filed in accordance with O.C.G.A. title 36, ch. 66 (O.C.G.A. § 36-67A-1 et seq.). A similar disclosure is required of applicants and representatives of applicants at the time a rezoning request is filed with the county.

DIVISION 4. - GWINNETT ANIMAL ADVISORY COUNCIL 

Sec. 2-370. - Code of ethics. 
As a member of the Gwinnett Animal Advisory Council (GAAC) representing all the citizens in the county, I shall constantly strive: 
To devote time, thought, and study to the duties and responsibilities of the GAAC so that I may render effective and credible service; 
To work with my fellow GAAC members in a spirit of harmony and cooperation in spite of differences of opinion that arises during vigorous debates of points at issue; 
To base my personal decision upon all available facts in each situation; to vote my honest conviction in every case, unswayed by partisan bias of any kind; thereafter, to abide by and uphold the final majority decision of the council; 
To remember at all times that, as a member of the GAAC, I have no legal authority other than that given in the bylaws; and to conduct my relationships with the county staff, local citizenry, and all others on the basis of this fact; and to refrain from communicating any confidential information to any outside source; 
To resist every temptation and outside pressure to use my position as a GAAC member to benefit either myself or any other individual or agency apart from the total interest of the county; 
To bear in mind under all circumstances that the primary function of the GAAC is to act as an advisory group to the board of commissioners, county administrator, and the county police department; and that the administration of animal control and the conduct of the county business shall be left to county animal welfare and enforcement unit, the county police department, the county administrator, and the board of commissioners, as well as employed management, professional and support staff; 
To welcome and encourage cooperation by citizens and organizations in the county; and

(2)  Gwinnett County employees, officials, and their family members are prohibited from seeking, requesting, or receiving any material payment, gift, job offer, security, promise of future benefit, or any other tangible or intangible thing of value when such receipt has the potential to influence a procurement decision or to gain undue advantage in a procurement competition, and as outlined in the County's Ethics Ordinance. 
(3)  Prospective vendors must compete for county business within the parameters of the solicitation process and are prohibited from seeking to obtain inside information, attempting to skew the writing of specifications or influencing a procurement decision through any means outside the process established for the particular solicitation. This principle applies to any contractor, subcontractor, representative, employee or agent that may be associated with a procurement transaction. 
(4)  The County's Ethics Ordinance shall be consulted for requirements related to disclosures by bidders and proposers on county contracts and individuals and firms who do business with the county. 
(5)  Ethical business practices are important both during a solicitation and after the decision to grant an award. To this end, the county seeks to establish relationships with business partners whose ongoing ethical standards of business conduct are congruent with those outlined here. The director of financial services is charged with establishing methods for ongoing monitoring for non-compliance with these principles. The prohibition against the offering of or the acceptance of kickbacks, gratuities, payments or any other thing of value extends beyond and outside any specific procurement or solicitation. 
(6)  A vendor's contract compliance history with Gwinnett County and other contractual parties is a valid element in the decision to award a solicitation. 
(7)  Gwinnett County stipulates that the furtherance of its strategic goals for job creation, stability and growth in the tax base, business retention, and other fiscal and economic development objectives may be considered during the procurement process. The director of financial services is authorized to establish procurement initiatives consistent with the county's strategic economic development objectives. These procurement practices shall be applied consistently and equitably, and shall have a direct relationship to the county's goals. 
(8)  Gwinnett County employees, officials, and their family members are generally prohibited from participation in any procurement decision or any gain of undue advantage in a procurement competition as a result of contemporaneous employment with a potential or actual business partner. 
(9)  It is unethical for any county employee to purchase commodities or services from a county contract for personal use. 
(10)  With the exception of solicitations for the sale of real property, individuals, firms and businesses seeking an award of a Gwinnett County contract may not initiate or continue any verbal or written communications regarding a solicitation with any county officer, elected official, employee or other county representative other than the purchasing associate named in the solicitation between the date of the issuance of the solicitation and the date of the final contract award by the board of commissioners. The purchasing director will review violations. If determined that such communication has compromised the competitive process, the offer submitted by the individual, firm or business may be disqualified from consideration for award. Solicitations for the sale of real property may allow for verbal or written communications with the appropriate Gwinnett County representative.

DIVISION 3. - PROCUREMENT METHODS 

Sec. 2-491. - Summary of methods of procurement. 
In most cases, this article recognizes seven methods of procurement and the conditions where each method shall be used. 
(1)  Competitive sealed bidding . In most cases the competitive sealed bid is the preferred method of procurement in the public sector and should be used whenever possible as it allows qualified, responsive bidders to compete on the basis of price. Generally, the following conditions must be met: 
a.  Clear and adequate specifications are available. 
b.  Two or more responsible bidders are willing to participate in the process. 
c.  Cost of materials, supplies, equipment, services or project is greater than $100,000.00. 
d.  Revenue is greater than $100,000.00. 
(2)  Competitive sealed proposal . When use of the competitive sealed bid is either not practical or not advantageous to the county, a contract may be entered into by use of the competitive sealed proposal. Use of the proposal is dependent upon such factors as: 
a.  Whether quality, availability or capability is overriding in relation to price in procurement of technical supplies or technical or professional services. 
b.  Whether the initial installation needs to be evaluated together with subsequent maintenance and service capabilities and what priorities should be given these requirements in the county's best interest. 
c.  Whether a fixed price or cost type contract is more advantageous. 
d.  Whether the market place will respond better to a solicitation permitting not only a range of alternate proposals, but evaluation and discussion of them before making the award. 
e.  Cost of equipment, services or project is greater than $100,000.00. 
f.  Revenue is greater than $100,000.00. 
(3)  Informal purchase . Those purchases $100,000.00 or less do not justify the administrative time and expense for the conduction of competitive sealed bids or proposals. The purchasing division director is authorized to establish the methods and procedures to be used in handling informal purchases. Unless otherwise specifically provided, such purchases will be obtained competitively through telephone quotations or informal written solicitations. 
(4)  Sole source purchase . A sole source procurement may be used when only one vendor or supplier is able to fill requirements for the intended use. Sole source may be used for compatibility with equipment for repair purposes, or for compatibility with existing systems. Standardization may require a sole source procurement, depending upon the intended use. 
Standardization, which is either established as a result of past procurement(s) or by approval of the purchasing policy and review committee, can be a satisfactory justification for a sole source. 
(5)  Emergency purchase . An emergency exists when there is a threat to the health, welfare or safety of people or property, or when there is a material disruption of goods or services. The competitive process should be followed whenever possible in an emergency as long as the ability to respond to the emergency is not seriously impaired. 
(6)  Cooperative purchase . The county may participate in a cooperative purchase for the acquisition of commodities, supplies and services through an authorized contract of any other governmental entity or agency whether federal, state or local provided a competitive procurement process has been followed and determined to be in the best interest of the county. Documentation to substantiate this decision will be maintained by the purchasing division. 
(7)  Governmental and affiliated entity purchase . The county may purchase services and incidental commodities from other federal, state or local governments, associations and non-profit organizations when determined to be in the best interest of the county. Documentation to substantiate this decision will be maintained by the purchasing division. 
( Ord. No. PUR-2016(GCID No. 2016-0219) , § I(3), 3-15-2016) 
Sec. 2-492. - Mandatory pre-qualification process. 
(a)  Public works construction contracts governed by O.C.G.A. § 36-91-20 et seq . The purchasing division director is hereby delegated the authority to administer a process for mandatory pre-qualification of prospective bidders for public works construction contracts pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-91-20(f). 
(b)  All other contracts . The purchasing division director is authorized to determine that a process for mandatory pre-qualification for competitive sealed bids and competitive sealed proposals of bidders or proposers is appropriate for the procurement of a particular commodity or service, subject to these requirements: 
(1)  Criteria for pre-qualification shall be reasonably related to the project or the quality of the work. 
(2)  Criteria for pre-qualification shall be available to any prospective bidder requesting such information. 
(3)  There shall be a method of notifying prospective bidders of the criteria for pre-qualification. 
(4)  There shall be a procedure for a disqualified bidder to respond to his or her disqualification to the purchasing division director; however, such procedure shall not include a formal appeal. 
No bid or proposal shall be eligible for consideration by the county from a prospective bidder who has not been pre-qualified on the procurement in question where the invitation to bid or request for proposals specified that pre-qualification would be mandatory, and any bid or proposal received shall be returned to the prospective bidder unopened. 
( Ord. No. PUR-2016(GCID No. 2016-0219) , § II(3), 3-15-2016) 
Sec. 2-493. - Competitive sealed bidding. 
(a)  Acquisitions greater than $100,000.00 . Any commodity that is expected to cost or generate revenue greater than $100,000.00 shall be acquired through the competitive sealed bid process except as otherwise provided in this article. 
(b)  Dissemination of invitation to bid . Public notice of an invitation to bid shall be given as required by Georgia law. The public notice shall contain a general description of the purchase and state the location where documents may be obtained and the date, time and place of bid opening. Any required bonding and insurance shall be included in the public notice. Notification of formal solicitations shall be posted in the Gwinnett Justice and Administration Center. Any other methods of advertisement identified as likely to result in additional competition may be used in addition to required advertisement, at the discretion of the purchasing division director. 
(c)  Receipt of bid . No written bid shall be eligible for consideration by the county unless it is placed in a sealed envelope or package and actually received by the purchasing division by the date and time specified in the invitation to bid. All bids shall be stamped or annotated with the date and time of receipt and secured until the designated opening time. A bid delivered late shall under no circumstances be eligible for consideration by the county. 
(d)  Bid opening . Bids shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses on the date and at the time and place designated in the invitation to bid. The name of each bidder, the purchase price contained in each bid, and such other information as the purchasing division director deems appropriate shall be announced as the bids are opened. A record of bid information shall be recorded and available for public inspection. 
(e)  Modification of bid . Any clerical mistake that is patently obvious on the face of a bid, subject to the limitations described below, may be corrected upon written request and verification, submitted by the bidder. A non-material omission in a bid may be clarified and/or corrected if the purchasing division director determines the clarification and/or correction to be in the county's best interest. Omissions affecting or relating to any of the following shall be deemed material and shall not be corrected after bid opening: 
(1)  Price information. 
(2)  Any required bonding. 
(f)  Withdrawal of bid . Bids may be withdrawn at any time prior to the bid opening. After bids have been publicly opened, withdrawal of bid shall be based upon the following: 
The bidder shall give notice in writing of his claim of right to withdraw his bid due to an error within two business days after the conclusion of the bid opening procedure. Bids may be withdrawn from consideration if the price was substantially lower than the other bids due solely to a mistake therein, provided the bid was submitted in good faith, and the mistake was a clerical mistake as opposed to a judgment mistake, and was actually due to an unintentional arithmetic error or an unintentional omission of a quantity of work, labor or material made directly in the compilation of the bid, which unintentional arithmetic error or unintentional omission can be clearly shown by objective evidence drawn from inspection of original work papers, documents and materials used in the preparation of the bid sought to be withdrawn. The bidder's original work papers shall be the sole acceptable evidence of error and mistake if request is made to withdraw the bid. If a bid is withdrawn under the authority of this provision, the lowest remaining responsive bid shall be deemed to be the low bid. 
(g)  Bid evaluation . Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitation to bid. No criteria may be used in bid evaluation that is not specifically set forth in the solicitation. 
(h)  Bid cancellation . An invitation to bid may be canceled prior to opening date or any or all bids may be rejected in whole or in part as may be specified in the solicitation, where it is in the best interest of the county in accordance with regulations promulgated by the purchasing division or, as a result of improper conduct on the part of a county employee. The reasons for any cancellation shall be made part of the bid file. 
(i)  Bid award . 
(1)  Responsive and responsible bidder(s) . Subject to approval by the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners, bids shall be awarded to the responsible bidder(s) who have submitted the lowest cost responsive bid(s), highest revenue responsive bid(s), or whose bid represents the best value to the county.

(5)  Tie bids . In the event two responsive bids are tied for the lowest price and the other terms and conditions of the two bids are substantially the same, the bid shall be awarded to the local firm if only one of the bidders has an office located within the boundaries of Gwinnett County. If both or neither of the tied bidders are local firms, the purchasing staff shall request the firms best and final offers, and the award shall be to the lowest bid.

Sec. 2-495. - Informal purchase. 
(a)  General . Procurements that involve amounts $100,000.00 or less do not require a formal sealed bid/proposal process. However, the processes used for this type of procurement will include as much competition as is consistent with the anticipated cost of the procurement and the best interest of the county. 
(b)  Prohibition of improper use of informal purchase process . Purchases may not be artificially divided as to constitute an informal purchase, thereby circumventing the dollar limit requirement for competitive sealed bids/proposals. 
(c)  Procedures . Procurement within this category shall be made in accordance with the informal purchase procedures established by the purchasing division director. These procedures will cover purchases delegated to user departments as well as those handled through the central procurement process. 
Such operational procedures shall provide for obtaining adequate and reasonable competition for the supply, service or construction being purchased. Further, such operational procedures shall require the preparation and maintenance of written records to adequately document the competition obtained, properly account for the funds expended and facilitate audit/review of the transaction.

(f)  Informal purchases by purchasing staff . Purchasing staff shall obtain commodities and services competitively through telephone solicitations where cost is $5,000.00 but less than $10,000.00. A minimum of three quotations is required unless adequate source supply is not available.

(g)  As to any location licensed in the future, if the distance requirements in this section are met at the time of issuance of any license, the subsequent opening and operation of a church or school within the distance prohibited herein shall not prevent the continuance of an existing license or the renewal thereof or the issuance of a new license to any subsequent owner of such property; provided, however, that the distance requirements herein shall not apply at any location for which a new license is applied for if the sale of alcoholic beverages was lawful at such location at any time during the 12 months immediately preceding such application.

Employees of a licensed establishment whose duties are limited solely to those of busboy(s), cook(s), or dishwasher(s) shall also be excluded from this section. 
(3)  No permit shall be issued until such time as a signed application has been filed with the police department, chief of police or designee, and upon paying a fee which shall be established by the board of commissioners, and a search of the criminal record of the applicant completed. The application shall include, but shall not be limited to, the name, date of birth, and prior arrest record of the person, though the fact of an arrest record shall be used for investigative purposes only, and shall give rise to no presumption or inference of guilt. Due to the inclusion of arrest information, these applications shall be regarded as confidential and shall not be produced for public inspection without a court order. 
(4)  The chief of police or his designee shall have a complete and exhaustive search made relative to any police record of the person fingerprinted or cleared. If there is no record of a violation of this chapter, the chief of police or his designee shall issue a permit to the person, by mail, stating that the person is eligible for employment. If it is found that the person is not eligible for employment, the chief of police or his designee shall notify the person, in writing, that they are not eligible for employment, the cause of such denial and their right to appeal. 
(5)  No person shall be granted a pouring permit unless it appears to the satisfaction of the chief of police or his designee that such person has not been convicted or pled guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling, or illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or the illegal sale or possession of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer of alcoholic beverages to minors in a manner contrary to law, keeping a place of prostitution, solicitation of sodomy, or any sexual related crime within a period of five years of the date of conviction and has been released from parole or probation. A person's first time conviction for illegal possession of alcohol as a misdemeanor or violation of a county ordinance shall not, by itself, make a person ineligible for an alcohol pouring permit. No person shall be granted a pouring permit who has been convicted, plead guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any federal, state, or local law for any felony within five years of the date of conviction and has not been released from parole or probation prior to the filing for application for such permit. For purposes of this chapter, a conviction or plea of guilt or nolo contendere shall be ignored as to any offense for which defendant who was allowed to avail themselves of O.C.G.A. title 43, ch. 8 art. 3 (O.C.G.A. § 42-8-60 et seq.), the Georgia First Offender Act; except, however, that any such offense shall not be ignored where the defendant violated any term of probation imposed by the court granting first offender treatment or committed another crime and the sentence in court entered an adjudication of guilt as to the crime for which the defendant had previously been sentenced as a first offender. 
(6)  An alcohol pouring permit shall be issued for a period of one calendar year from the date of the original application. As noted in subsection (11) of this section, the alcohol pouring permit must be in the possession of the employee while the employee is working at the licensed establishment. This permit must be in the possession of the employee while the pouring permit holder is working and available for inspection by members of the police department or the licensing and revenue manager's staff. 
(7)  No person shall be issued a permit if it is determined that the person falsified, concealed or covered up any material fact by any device, trick or scheme while making application to the police department for an alcoholic beverage pouring permit under this section. If it is determined that a person is in violation of this subsection and a permit is denied for this reason, then 30 calendar days must elapse from the date of notification per certified mailing before a new application and fee may be resubmitted. 
(8)  All permits issued through administrative error can be terminated and seized by the chief of police or his designee, or the licensing and revenue manager or his designee. 
(9)  Replacement permits will be issued within 30 days of original date, upon paying one-half of the fee charged for alcohol pouring permits. After 30 days of original application date, a new application and fee must be submitted. 
(10)  All permits issued under this chapter remain the property of the police department and shall be produced for inspection upon the demand of any officer or designee of the police department or employee of the business license department. 
(11)  No licensee shall allow any employee or manager required to hold a permit to work on the premises unless the employee or manager has in their possession a current valid county pouring permit. For new employees, a receipt issued by the county police permit unit may be used for a maximum of 30 days from the date of its issue. Licensees are required by this chapter to inspect and verify that each employee required to do so has in their possession a valid current alcohol pouring permit. 
(12)  It shall be the duty of all persons holding any license to sell alcoholic beverages to file with the chief of police or his designee the name of the establishment, the license number and a list of all employees, with their home addresses and home telephone numbers, twice annually during the month of June and again during the month of December.

Sec. 6-32. - Open area and patio sales. 
(a)  Alcoholic beverage sales can be made by a licensed consumption on-premises establishment in a patio/open area type environment if the establishment has been approved to do so by the licensing and revenue manager. 
(b)  The requirement for approval is that the patio/open area be enclosed by some structure providing for public ingress/egress only through the main licensed premises. The purpose of this requirement is to prevent a customer from leaving the outside sales area with an open drink without the licensee's knowledge. 
(c)  The height of such structure shall be a minimum of three feet above ground level. It does not have to be solid nor does it have to restrict visibility into or out of the patio/open sales area.

(d)  The only exit from this type area is to be through the licensed establishment's main premises and through an approved fire exit, not for general public use unless an emergency exists. The fire exit should be of the type that sounds an alarm so that the establishment will be alerted in the event of unauthorized use when no emergency exists. 
(e)  If a licensee desires a patio/open sales area inside an existing structure, plans will be reviewed and approved on an individual basis by the licensing and revenue manager. Interior type patio/open sales areas must also meet the requirements of the county's development and fire codes. 
(f)  Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit a hotel or motel with a consumption on the premises license from making sales and allowing consumption of alcoholic beverages in ballrooms, meeting rooms, reception rooms, or patio areas of such hotel or motel, provided such functions are catered in connection with a meeting, conference, convention or similar type gathering at such hotel or motel.

(b)  It is prohibited for customers to gather outside an alcoholic beverage establishment and consume alcoholic beverages. 
(c)  It is prohibited for the manager or any employee to allow persons to gather outside an alcoholic beverage establishment and consume alcoholic beverages.

A partially consumed bottle of wine that is to be removed from the premises must be securely resealed by the licensee or its employees before removal from the premises. The partially consumed bottle of wine shall be placed in a bag or other container that is secured in such a manner that it is visibly apparent if the container has been subsequently opened or tampered with, and a dated receipt for the bottle of wine and meal shall be provided by the licensee and attached to the container.

No alcoholic beverage license shall be issued to any person unless the building in which the business will be located is complete and detailed plans of the building and outside premises are attached to the application, or unless proposed plans and specifications and a building permit of a proposed building to be built are attached to the application. The completed building or the proposed building shall comply with ordinances of the county, regulations of the state revenue commissioner and the state. The proposed building shall also be subject to final inspection and approval when completed by the building inspector. Each building in which the business will be located shall contain sufficient lighting so that the building itself and the premises on all sides of the building are readily visible at all times from the front of the street on which the building is located so as to reveal all of the outside premises of such building. Each applicant for an alcoholic beverage license shall attach to the application evidence of ownership of the building or proposed building, or a copy of the lease if the applicant is leasing the building. If the applicant is a franchisee, then such applicant shall attach a copy of the franchise agreement or contract with the application.

(Code 1978, § 7-2059; Code 1994, § 6-42) 
Sec. 6-40. - Types of entertainment, attire and conduct prohibited. 
(a)  Preamble and purpose. 
(1)  Based upon the experiences of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Seattle and Renton, Washington; New York, New York; Los Angeles, California; and Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida, which experiences the board of commissioners believes are relevant to the problems faced by the county and based upon the evidence and testimony of the citizens and experts who have appeared before such bodies, the board of commissioners takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. 
(2)  Moreover, it is the finding of the board of commissioners that public nudity and semi-nudity, under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances relating to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "erotic entertainment" begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhoods, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude or semi-nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare and is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity or semi-nudity. 
(b)  Prohibited activities. Any establishment licensed under the provisions of this chapter is prohibited from permitting or engaging in the following activities: 
(1)  The employment or use of any person, in any capacity, in the sale or service of alcoholic beverages while such person is unclothed or in such attire, costume or clothing as to expose to view any portion of the female breast below the top of the areola or any portion of the pubic hair, anus, cleft of the buttocks, vulva or genitals; 
(2)  Live entertainment which provides or features nude or semi-nude or erotic dancing, or the performance of obscene acts which simulate: 
a.  Sexual intercourse, masturbation, sodomy, bestiality, oral copulation, flagellation or any sexual acts which are prohibited by law; 
b.  The touching, caressing or fondling of the breast, buttock, anus or genitals; or 
c.  The displaying of the pubic hair, anus, vulva or genitals; 
(3)  The showing of any film, still pictures, electronic reproduction or other visual reproductions depicting any of the acts described in subsection (b)(2) of this section, which are obscene under state law; or 
(4)  The holding, promotion or allowance of any contest, promotion, special night or any other activity where patrons of the licensed establishment are encouraged or allowed to engage in any of the above-prohibited conduct. 
(c)  Mainstream activity excluded. Notwithstanding the prohibitions in subsection (b) of this section, nothing in this chapter shall or is intended to apply to theatrical or motion picture performance houses, museums, or the like where the consumption or service of alcohol is not a primary purpose or mainstream activity of such establishment.

If animal control officers learn of an owner, they will make notification in person by posting a notice on the owner's door if the owner lives within the county or notification by mail to the owner of such animal, if an address is known or can be reasonably ascertained. The same ten-calendar-day hold period will apply from the date of the door posting or mailing.

An animal deemed to be highly desirable for adoption may be kept beyond the six-day limitation, provided that the animal does not evidence any apparent signs of illness, injury, contagious or infectious diseases and that space is available to house the animal, at the discretion of the director of the division of animal welfare. Animals may be released to Georgia licensed rescue groups or to approved foster homes authorized to accept animals if not claimed or adopted as provided. Animals shall not be provided to any public or private institution, animal dealer or other individual who may use or supply the animal for research purposes. 
(b)  Any animal which is suffering excessively or any animal which represents a real danger to persons or other animals, without regard to the period of confinement as provided for in subsection (a) of this section, shall be euthanized by officers of the animal welfare division in as humane a manner as possible.

In the absence of an available veterinarian, the animal control officer may consult with a superior on duty. If both agree that the animal should be euthanized, the animal may be euthanized and then a report on the reason for euthanization will be completed. This action may be taken to control the spread of disease or to eliminate any further pain and/or suffering of an animal.

the board of commissioners finds: 
(1)  Adult establishments, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. Alcohol consumption impairs judgment and lowers inhibitions, thereby increasing the risk of adverse secondary effects. 
(2)  Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the county has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the county's rationale for this article, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the county's interest in regulating adult establishments extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future adult establishments that may locate in the county. The county finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this article are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects. 
The county hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and legislative record related to the adverse secondary effects of adult establishments, including the judicial opinions and reports related to such secondary effects.

(3)  In the event the applicant is qualified for employment in a pawnshop under this section and there is no record of a violation of this article, the chief of police or his designee shall issue a permit to the applicant, by mail, stating that the person is eligible for employment. If it is found that the person is not qualified for a permit and therefore ineligible for employment in a pawnshop, the chief of police or his designee shall notify the person, in writing, that they are not eligible for employment, the cause of such denial and their right to appeal. 
(4)  No person who has been convicted or pled guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling, or any felonies, or any crime involving theft or fraudulent practices shall be issued a permit for the five years preceding the date of application.

Pawnshop owners are required by this article to inspect and verify that each employee or manager has in their possession a valid current pawnshop permit. Issuance of this fee receipt shall allow the applicant to work in the position applied for only until such time as the required criminal history background investigation is completed. The temporary privilege conferred by issuance of this fee receipt shall expire immediately upon completion of such background investigation. If the background investigation indicates that the applicant does not meet the requirements for issuance of a pawnshop permit, the applicant may appeal the denial of the permit as provided in this article. However, issuance of this fee receipt and the temporary privilege granted thereby shall not be construed as conferring any right or privilege to the applicant to continue working in the position for which the permit sought during the pendency of the appeal from the denial of a permit under this article. 
(10)  It shall be the duty of all persons holding a pawnshop occupation tax certificate to file with the chief of police or his designee, the name of the establishment, the occupation tax certificate number and a list of all employees, including their date of birth, home address and home telephone numbers, twice annually; during the month of June and again during the month of December.

(a)  All providers must obtain a nonexclusive franchise to construct, operate and maintain a system to provide cable or video services within all or any portion of the county. Subject to federal law, neither the grantee nor any other person may transfer a franchise or any of the grantee's rights or obligations in or regarding the cable system or video service system or the franchise without the prior written consent of the board, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
(b)  A new or renewal franchise shall be granted by the board of commissioners pursuant to this chapter, upon receipt of a completed application and execution of a written franchise agreement: 
(1)  Within 90 days for applications by phone companies and others with existing access to public rights-of-way; or 
(2)  Within 180 days for applications by entities without existing access to public rights-of-way. 
Action on a request for approval of the transfer of a franchise shall be 90 days upon receipt of a completed application. The deadline will be calculated from the date that the applicant first files certain requisite information in writing with the county and payment of the application fee. For purposes of any disputes that may arise, the applicant will have the burden of proving that it filed the application, by producing either a receipt-stamped copy of the filing or a certified mail return receipt indicating receipt of the required documentation. The county may toll the running of the 90-day or six-month time period if the communications administrator has requested information in writing from the franchise applicant and is waiting for such information. Once the information is received by the communications administrator, the time period would automatically begin to run again. 
(c)  An applicant seeking a new or renewal franchise must file with the communications administrator, or his designee, a written application, with the information required pursuant to section 22-28. Application from a grantee to obtain approval of a request to transfer a franchise must also include FCC Form 394 Application for Franchising Authority Consent to Assignment or Transfer of Control of Cable Television Franchise; or such other information as required by federal law. 
(d)  Unless waived, in whole or part, by the communications administrator in writing, the following application fees shall be submitted with the application and upon acceptance of said submission for review and consideration shall not be refundable. Failure to pay a required application fee shall cause the application to be returned to the applicant without consideration by the county. 
(1)  $2,500.00 for a new franchise or for a request to transfer a franchise agreement; and 
(2)  $1,500.00 for the renewal or modification of a franchise agreement. 
(e)  Within 30 days after acceptance for review, the communications administrator will notify the applicant if the application is not complete and the nature of any additional information required for completing the application. 
(f)  Applicants for an initial franchise have the right to begin providing services pursuant to the terms of this chapter, if a franchise is not granted or if the negotiation of a franchise agreement has not been completed within 180 days, as appropriate, provided the application provisions of article III of this chapter have been fully satisfied. If the applicant begins providing cable or video services pursuant to this provision without an approved franchise, the parties shall continue to negotiate in good faith on a franchise agreement, the terms of which shall then be retroactive to the end of the 180-day period. 
(g)  Applicants seeking modification or renewal pursuant to subsection (j) of this section must demonstrate economic harm as a result of an unfair competitive disadvantage. 
(h)  The board shall not grant a renewal or approve a transfer unless the county has given the grantee at least 30 days' advance written notice of the initial meeting at which the board will consider such action. The notice shall advise the grantee of the time, place and purpose of the meeting. 
(i)  Subject to the county's necessary and lawful exercise of its police powers as evidenced by valid amendments to certain provisions of this chapter, franchise rights and obligations may only be amended through a written amendment to the franchise agreement executed by both the county and grantee. 
(j)  During the franchise term, a grantee may file an application with the communications administrator to negotiate modifications to its agreement to eliminate any unfair competitive advantage of another entity providing multi-channel video service over the public right-of-way in its service area under a franchise pursuant to this chapter or under a state or federal franchise that, on balance, contains terms and conditions that are more favorable or less burdensome to the entity than the terms and conditions contained in the grantee's franchise, thus causing economic harm to said grantee. 
(k)  The county reserves the right to issue a license, easement or other permit to anyone other than a grantee to permit that person to traverse any portion of a grantee's franchise area within the county in order to provide service outside the county. Such license or easement, absent a grant of a franchise in accordance with this chapter, shall not be deemed authorization by the county for said person to use the county's public ways to provide cable or video service of any nature to any home or place of business within the county, or to render any other service or connect any subscriber within the county to the cable or video system or OVS of such person. 
(Code 1994, § 22-31; Ord. of 10-2-2007, § 22-02.01) 
Sec. 22-28. - Application for franchise. 
(a)  To obtain, modify or renew any franchise to control, own, construct or maintain any cable or video service system within the county, an applicant must file with the communications administrator, or his designee, the following information: 
(1)  Written certification of the name under which the applicant is doing or intends to do business; 
(2)  The names and business addresses of the directors and principal executive officers, and the location of the applicant's principal business office; 
(3)  The source of funds for operation of the cable system and a demonstration of financial ability to provide and extend cable or video service to proposed subscribers in accordance with applicant's proposed plan; 
(4)  A description of the applicant's service area, which description shall be sufficiently detailed so as to allow the county to respond to subscriber inquiries. As supplement to such written description, the applicant is to provide a map that is clear and legible and that fairly describes the boundaries of the geographic area to be served in clear and concise terms; 
(5)  The estimated commencement dates of construction of the cable system or video system, and the targeted date(s) when cable service or video service will be made available to subscribers or potential subscribers in the service area(s) named under applicant's current business plan; 
(6)  The name, business address, electronic mail address, and telephone and fax number of its local agent and all persons who are authorized to represent or act on behalf of the applicant in those matters pertaining to the application. The requirement to make the disclosure described in this section shall continue until the county has granted or rejected an application, or until an applicant withdraws its application; 
(7)  Whether the applicant holds an existing authorization to access the community's public rights-of-way; and 
(8)  The requested terms and conditions of a franchise agreement. 
(b)  Applicants may also include additional terms and procedures subject to negotiation, and such terms and procedures shall be negotiated in good faith. 
(c)  Renewal applicants may, but are not required to, file information in subsections (a)(3), (5) and (7) of this section with the communications administrator. 
(Code 1994, § 22-32; Ord. of 10-2-2007, § 22-02.02) 
Sec. 22-29. - Acts at grantee's expense. 
(a)  An applicant or grantee to whom the board grants one or more non-exclusive franchises shall, in addition to the nonrefundable application fee specified herein, pay to the county at the time the grantee files its franchise agreement acceptance, any incremental direct costs reasonably incurred by the county in granting the franchise that are in excess of the amount of the application fee. The total application fee and any incremental direct costs paid by applicant or grantee shall not exceed $5,000.00 for a renewal franchise. 
(b)  Any act that the grantee is or may be required to perform under this chapter, a franchise agreement or applicable law shall be performed at the grantee's expense, unless expressly provided to the contrary in this chapter, franchise agreement or other applicable law. 
(Code 1994, § 22-33; Ord. of 10-2-2007, § 22-02.03) 
Sec. 22-30. - Preemption. 
In the event that federal or state laws, rules or regulations preempt a provision or limit the enforceability of a provision of this chapter, then the provision shall be read to be preempted but only to the extent and for the time required by law. In the event such federal or state law, rule or regulation is subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or otherwise changed so that the provision herein that had been preempted is no longer preempted, parties shall negotiate in good faith to establish a reasonable timeframe in which such provision shall thereupon return to full force and effect, and shall thereafter be binding on all grantees, without the requirement of further action on the part of the county.

ARTICLE III. - FRANCHISE CHARACTERISTICS 

Sec. 22-49. - Term of franchise. 
The term of a franchise shall be ten years. The effective date of a renewal franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall be retroactive to the expiration date of the prior franchise. 
(Code 1994, § 22-51; Ord. of 10-2-2007, § 22-03.01) 
Sec. 22-50. - Franchise fee. 
(a)  Every grantee shall pay a franchise fee of five percent of gross revenue. Each grantee shall pay to the county, on or before the 30th day following the end of each calendar quarter, a sum equal to five percent of its gross revenue during the preceding fiscal quarter. The county reserves the right to raise the franchise fee percentage up to the maximum amount allowed by law, upon 120 days' written notice. 
(b)  Within 30 days after the expiration of a grantee's fiscal quarter, a grantee shall file with the communications administrator a report showing the quarter's and year-to-date gross revenue. Payment of the current franchise fees shall be made to the county at the time of this statement. 
(c)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the incumbent providers renewing existing franchise agreements as of the effective date of this chapter may continue to pay franchise fees and file reports on the same schedule identical to that specified in their franchise agreements being renewed. 
(d)  If any payment required by this chapter is not actually received by the county on or before the applicable date fixed in this chapter or by franchise agreement, then the communications administrator shall provide written notice to the franchise holder giving the cable service provider or video service provider 15 days from the date of the franchise holder's receipt of such notice to cure any such nonpayment. In the event franchise fees are not remitted to the affected local government authority postmarked on or before the expiration of the 15-day cure period, then the holder of the state franchise shall pay interest thereon, from the due date to the date paid at a rate of one percent per month, compounded daily, for the period of delinquency. 
(e)  The county shall have the right, no more than once annually, to audit the business records of a grantee to the extent necessary to ensure payment in accordance with this chapter and its franchise agreement. For purposes of this subsection, an audit shall be defined as a comprehensive review of the records of the holder of a franchise. Once any audited period of a franchise holder has been the subject of a requested audit, such audited period of such franchise holder shall not again be the subject of any audit. In the event of a dispute concerning the amount of the franchise fee due, an action may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction by an affected local governing authority seeking to recover an additional amount alleged to be due or by a state franchise holder seeking a refund of an alleged overpayment; provided, however, that any such action shall be brought within three years following the end of the quarter to which the disputed amount relates. Such time period may be extended by written agreement between the franchise holder and the county. 
(f)  Each grantee shall, consistent with and subject to grantee's legal rights under the Georgia Open Records Act (hereinafter "the Act") (O.C.G.A. § 50-18-70 et seq.), be responsible for making available to the county all records necessary to confirm the accurate payment of franchise fees, without regard to by whom they are held. Such records shall be made available pursuant to the requirements of this chapter. 
(g)  The county's audit expenses shall be borne by the county unless the audit discloses an underpayment of more than ten percent of any quarterly payment, in which case the county's out-of-pocket costs of the audit shall be borne by grantee as a cost incidental to the enforcement of its franchise. Any additional undisputed amounts due to the county as a result of the audit shall be paid within 30 days following written notice to grantee by the county of the underpayment, which notice shall include a copy of the audit report. If recomputation results in additional revenue to be paid to the county, interest will be due as specified in this section. 
(h)  No acceptance of any franchise fee payment by the county shall be construed as an accord and satisfaction that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount or a release of any claim that the franchising authority may have for further or additional sums payable under this agreement, and all amounts paid shall be subject to audit and recomputation by the county. All amounts paid shall be subject to audit and recomputation by the county for three years from the date of payment after which period payments shall be considered final. 
(i)  To the extent consistent with applicable federal and state law, the franchise fee payments required by this section shall be in addition to any and all taxes of a general nature or other fees or charges which grantee shall be required to pay to the county or to any state or federal agency or authority, as required herein or by law, all of which shall be separate and distinct obligations of grantee. Grantee shall not have or make any claim for any deduction or other credit of all or any part of the amount of the franchise fee payments from or against any of said county taxes or other fees or charges which grantee is required to pay to the county, except as required by law, this chapter, or a franchise agreement. Grantee shall not apply nor seek to apply all or any part of the amount of the franchise fee payments as a deduction or other credit from or against any of said county taxes or other fees or charges, each of which shall be deemed to be separate and distinct obligations of grantee. Nor shall grantee apply or seek to apply all or any part of the amount of any of said taxes or other fees or charges as a deduction or other credit from or against any of its franchise obligations, each of which shall be deemed to be separate and distinct obligations of grantee. 
(j)  In the event a franchise is revoked prior to its expiration date, grantee shall file with the county, within 90 days of the date of revocation, a financial statement certified by an independent certified public accountant that clearly shows the gross revenue received by grantee from the end of the previous fiscal quarter through the date of revocation and shall pay within that time the franchise fees accrued as of the date of revocation. 
(k)  The acceptance of any payment required herein by the county shall not be construed as an acknowledgment or an accord and satisfaction that the amount paid is the correct amount due, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release or waiver of any claim that the county may have for additional sums due and payable. However, the county's acceptance of full payment of the amount determined to be due by the county through an audit shall be construed as an accord and satisfaction. 
(l)  Payment of the franchise fee shall not be considered in the nature of a tax or in lieu of other taxes or fees imposed by the county, and a grantee shall not designate or characterize its franchise fee as a tax. 
(Code 1994, § 22-52; Ord. of 10-2-2007, § 22-03.02)

In the event that the grantee elects to overbuild, rebuild, modify, or sell the cable television system, the grantee shall adopt appropriate measures and take all reasonable actions with in its power to minimize any disruption of service to subscribers as a result of such action. 
(b)  In the event a grantee continues to operate all or any part of the cable system or video service system after the term of its franchise, then such provider shall continue to comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter and its franchise agreement, including, without limitation, all compensation and other payment provisions herein, throughout the period of such continues operation, provided that any such continued operation shall in no way be construed as a renewal or other extension of the term the franchise agreement.

Sec. 22-53. - PEG channels and financial support. 
(a)  Each franchise agreement shall require the grantee designate a sufficient amount of capacity on its network to provide a minimum of two activated channels, for PEG use and one additional closed circuit scrambled channel or capacity for governmental training and public safety purposes. The ongoing allocation of the PEG channels will be determined by the county. All PEG channels, other than the closed circuit scrambled channel or equivalent capacity and conditional access capability for government training and public safety purposes which shall only be made available to those locations within grantee's service area and authorized by the county, shall be made available to all subscribers unless both parties agree otherwise in writing. A grantee shall have the option of providing the government training and public safety channel on any nonbasic or digital tier of service. The grantee shall be entitled to use any reasonable, readily accessible means and technology to accomplish the purpose of the government training and public safety channel as specified in its franchise agreement. 
(b)  Each franchise agreement shall require the grantee to make available a sufficient amount of financial support throughout the franchise term for capital costs of acquiring, maintaining and replacing equipment and facilities, throughout the franchise term, for the PEG channels. Such funding shall be in an amount proportional to the number of subscribers served by each grantee in relation to the total number of subscribers served by all grantees combined. 
(1)  All providers of cable or video service within the county authorized under this chapter and the required franchise agreement will provide capital support for the county's development of PEG programming. The PEG capital support will be the equivalent of $0.08 per cable or video service subscriber per month, paid quarterly. Such amount will be reviewed every three years in light of changes in production demands, impact of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Users, and collections of PEG support from the previous three years, but in no case will it exceed the equivalent of $0.15 per cable or video service subscriber per month. For purposes of this section, all incumbent providers of cable or video service will begin providing the PEG capital support funding as of the effective date of respective renewal franchise agreements. For purposes of determining the impact of the CPI on the capital support, January 1, 2007, will be the base period CPI. 
(2)  For the purpose of computing the preceding level of funding for multiple dwelling units with bulk service agreements, the number of cable subscribers shall be computed on an equivalency subscriber basis. 
(3)  Such PEG funding shall be used by the county, in its sole discretion, for PEG-related purposes in accordance with this chapter, each respective franchise agreement and 47 USC 531. 
(c)  PEG financial support payments associated with this chapter shall be remitted to the county quarterly, concurrent with the payment of franchise fees; provided, however, such payments shall not be set off against franchise fees or taxes or applied toward the franchise fee cap under the Cable Act or other applicable law. A grantee may designate that portion of the subscriber's bill attributable to PEG financial support. 
(d)  Each cable and video service franchise agreement shall require a grantee to provide leased access channels. At a minimum the franchise shall require a grantee to satisfy the obligations of 47 USC 612.

The cable service provider or video service provider shall provide complimentary basic and extended basic cable service or video service to government buildings, public schools and public libraries over such service outlets free of charge, which service shall not be used for commercial purposes. 
(Code 1994, § 22-56; Ord. of 10-2-2007, § 22-03.06) 
Sec. 22-55. - Customer service standards and consumer protection. 
(a)  This section sets forth the minimum customer service standards that each grantee must satisfy. In addition, each grantee shall comply with the customer service standards set forth in 47 CFR 76.309(c), as such standards may be amended from time to time, and shall at all times satisfy any additional or stricter minimum requirements established by a franchise agreement or other applicable federal, state, or local law or regulation, as the same may be amended from time to time, including, without limitation, consumer protection laws. 
(b)  Subscription information, general. Before providing cable or video service to any potential subscriber and at least once a year to all subscribers, grantee shall provide to all subscribers, in a clear, complete and comprehensible form: 
(1)  A description of the cable or video services provided by the grantee, accompanied by a listing of all standard, non-promotional rates, terms and conditions, including policies concerning credits for outages and reception problems; 
(2)  A description of the grantee's billing and collection procedures; the procedure for resolution of billing disputes, including the telephone number of the county office subscribers may call with regard to billing disputes, as specified by the franchising authority; 
(3)  Local or toll free numbers for the grantee's customer service telephone system; and addresses of grantee's local office and any other locations proximate to the service area where customers may make payments or drop off equipment; and 
(4)  A description of privacy rights accorded to the subscriber pursuant to applicable law. 
(c)  The terms, conditions and duration of promotional subscriptions shall be provided by a grantee in writing prior to a subscriber being billed for such promotional subscription. 
(d)  Upon receiving a cash deposit and, if requested, a receipt showing the date thereof; the name of the applicant or customer and the current billing address; the service to be furnished or presently furnished; and the amount of the deposit and the rate of interest to be paid thereon. 
(e)  Grantee shall maintain an office within the county, or within 15 air miles of the Gwinnett Justice and Administration Center, that shall be open and accessible to the public with adequate telephone service during normal business hours. Said office or listing shall be so operated that complaints and requests for repairs or adjustments may be received and processed with a minimum delay. 
(f)  Grantee shall establish maintenance service capable of promptly locating and correcting system malfunctions under "normal operating conditions" as defined in 47 CFR 76.309. Grantee shall begin said maintenance service within 24 hours after the interruption becomes known to the grantee for system malfunctions affecting one or more percent of grantee's total number of subscribers. 
(g)  Grantee shall arrange for pickup and replacement of converters or other grantee equipment at the subscriber's address or by a satisfactory equivalent (such as the provision of a postage-prepaid mailer) if requested by a mobility-limited customer. 
(h)  In the event that service to subscribers is totally interrupted for more than 24 hours, grantee shall provide the affected subscribers with a pro rata credit or rebate of the subscriber fees paid or payable. 
(i)  Grantee shall establish a clear procedure for resolving complaints filed by subscribers. Complaints may be made orally or in writing, at the complainant's option. The grantee shall furnish a notice of such procedures to each subscriber at the time of the initial subscription to cable or video service. 
(j)  Each grantee holding a cash deposit shall keep a record thereof until the deposit is refunded. The record shall show the name and current billing address of each depositor; the amount and date of the deposit; and each transaction concerning the deposit. 
(k)  Grantee shall provide an initial response to a complaint within five business days of its receipt and a final written response within 30 days after a written complaint is received. The final written response shall include a notice stating that if the complaint has not been resolved to the complainant's satisfaction, the matter may be referred to the communications administrator.

(1)  It is unable pursuant to normal industry practice to obtain necessary programming, real property or access rights; 
(2)  When its prior service, payment, or theft of service history with a person has been unfavorable;

The temporary permit shall not exceed six months in duration. In the case of a continuing hardship, and in the discretion of the county board of commissioners or its designees, the permit may be extended for a period of up to an additional six months.

State Law reference— Sale or use of cleaning agents containing phosphorus, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-27.1. 

Sec. 38-66. - Declaration of policy. 
O.C.G.A. § 12-5-27.1 provides that whenever a local government entity is required by the environmental protection division to reduce phosphorus in its wastewater being discharged into the waters of the state, such local government entity shall pass an ordinance mandating the retail sale of low phosphorus household laundry detergent as part of its phosphorus reduction process. It is hereby declared to be the public policy of the county to encourage the use of clean, phosphate-free, household laundry detergents and to prohibit the sale of household laundry detergents which contain more than 0.5 percent phosphorus by weight. The board of commissioners finds that such use and sale will be a cost-effective way to reduce the amount of phosphorus in wastewater discharge so as to protect the state's rivers and lakes downstream; promote health, safety and welfare; and prevent injury to human health, plant and animal life and property. It is vital to the health, well-being and welfare of present and future inhabitants of the county that these sources be protected against contamination and pollution.

Sec. 38-148. - Stream buffer mitigation requirements. 
To achieve stream buffer mitigation that is proportional to the extent of the impact and consistent from project to project, all applicants requesting mitigation must follow the standardized processes as described in the Gwinnett County Stream Buffer Mitigation Bank procedures guide, available as a chapter of the Gwinnett County Storm Water Design Manual. The applicant will use the criteria outlined in the procedures guide to determine the amount of creation, restoration, enhancement, and/or preservation required relative to the degree of impact. An applicant has two options for mitigating impacts to an existing stream buffer protection zone as defined in the county stream buffer protection ordinance. The first option is to perform the mitigation on-site in accordance with the procedures described in subsection (1) of this section. The second option is for the applicant to pay a fee to the county stormwater capital project. 
(1)  On-site mitigation. An applicant may mitigate impacts to an existing stream buffer by performing an amount of mitigation that is equivalent to the mitigation requirement on-site in accordance with the on-site mitigation procedures in the procedures guide. If the amount of on-site mitigation is not sufficient to satisfy the mitigation requirement, then the applicant will be required to purchase credits from the Gwinnett County Stream Buffer Mitigation Bank. 
(2)  In-lieu fee mitigation. An applicant may mitigate impacts to an existing stream buffer by paying a fee to the stormwater capital project in accordance with the fee schedule. The fee will be based on the actual costs of stream buffer restoration and will be approved by the county commission. The fee schedule will be reviewed and revised as necessary to reflect the actual costs of restoration and submitted to the county commission for review and approval. 
(Code 1994, § 42-177; Res. No. SMA2005-001, 3-22-2005)

Secs. 38-175—38-201. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 2. - ILLICIT DISCHARGE AND ILLEGAL CONNECTION 

Sec. 38-202. - General provisions. 
(a)  Title. This division shall be known as the Illicit Discharge and Illegal Connection Ordinance. 
(b)  Authority. The authority for this division is based on home rule provisions of the Georgia Constitution, article IX, section II, paragraph III(a)(6). 
(c)  Findings. It is hereby determined that: 
(1)  The county separate storm sewer system was designed and installed to manage stormwater so as to prevent localized flooding, damage to property and risk to public safety; 
(2)  The county separate storm sewer system was not designed or installed as a receiving system for non-stormwater discharges; 
(3)  Discharges to the county separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
(4)  These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the county separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments; 
(5)  These non-stormwater discharges not only impact local waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters; 
(6)  The impacts of these non-stormwater discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
(7)  These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the county separate storm sewer system; 
(8)  Localities in the state are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of non-point source pollution caused by non-stormwater discharges to the county separate storm sewer system; 
(9)  The Clean Water Act requires the management and maintenance of the county separate storm sewer system and the management of discharges to that system; 
(10)  Therefore, in order to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the county separate storm sewer system, it is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the county separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment. 
(d)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this division is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare through the regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the county separate storm sewer system to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal law. This division establishes methods for controlling the introduction of non-stormwater discharges into the county separate storm sewer system in order to comply with requirements of the national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit process. The objectives of this division are to: 
(1)  Comply with all state department of natural resources (DNR) and Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) stormwater regulations developed pursuant to the Clean Water Act; 
(2)  Prohibit illicit discharges and illegal connections to the county separate storm sewer system; 
(3)  Prevent non-stormwater discharges, generated as a result of spills, inappropriate dumping or disposal, to the county separate storm sewer system; and 
(4)  Establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance, monitoring and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this division. 
(e)  Applicability. The provisions of this division shall apply throughout the unincorporated area of the county. The county may enter into agreements with cities within the county, or other municipalities, to carry out the purpose of this division. These agreements may include, but are not limited to, enforcement of provisions, resolution of disputes, and cooperative monitoring and management of the separate storm sewer system and management programs. 
(f)  Compatibility with other regulations. This division is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law. The requirements of this division constitute a minimum standard, should not be deemed to limit or repeal any other local requirements, and are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, and where any provision of this division imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
(g)  Responsibility for administration. 
(1)  The department shall have the power to administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this division and any procedures, standards and guidelines established under authority of this division. Such power shall include the right to maintain an action or procedure in any court of competent jurisdiction to compel compliance with or restrain any violation of this division. 
(2)  The department shall be responsible for the conservation, management, maintenance (where applicable), extension and improvement of the county separate storm sewer system, including activities necessary to control stormwater and activities necessary to administer and implement the stormwater management programs incorporated by reference into the county's NPDES stormwater permit. 
(3)  The department may develop, and update periodically, a stormwater management design manual for the guidance of persons preparing stormwater management plans, designing or operating stormwater management systems, and designing or operating facilities that may contribute non-stormwater discharges to the county's separate storm sewer system. 
(4)  The department may:

See: McLeod v. Columbia County, 278 Ga. 242 (2004). 
(Code 1994, § 100-51; Ord. of 11-1-2005) 
Sec. 38-241. - Findings. 
The board of commissioners of the county makes the following findings: 
(1)  The Federal Clean Water Act, as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 USC 1251 et seq.), and rules promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the Act emphasizes the role of local governments in developing, implementing, conducting and funding stormwater programs which address water quality impacts of stormwater runoff. 
(2)  Stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities will assist the county in meeting the regulatory obligations imposed by its national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permits by reducing pollution and increasing water quality within the county. 
(3)  Stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities will assist the county in protecting the public health, safety and welfare and the environment. Provision of stormwater management services, stormwater management systems and facilities and regulation of the use thereof renders and/or results in both service and benefit to individual parcels, parcel owners, citizens and residents of the county and to all parcels, parcel owners, citizens and residents of the county concurrently and the environment in a variety of ways. 
(4)  The area of impervious surface on each parcel is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities provided by the county or to be provided by the county in the future, and the area of impervious surfaces on each parcel is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater service charge. 
(5)  The county presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the county, and of additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the county to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater management systems and facilities in the county in concert with the management of other public utilities in the county. In order to do so, the county must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program's operating needs and capital program. 
(6)  Stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities are needed throughout the unincorporated areas of the county because many of those areas are developed. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the unincorporated area of the county is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
(7)  The provision of stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities in the county promotes an essential regulatory purpose by influencing where stormwater runoff flows and how it is managed, thereby reducing flooding, erosion and water pollution caused by stormwater runoff. 
(8)  By mitigating the impact of stormwater runoff from developed parcels, the stormwater management systems and facilities help prevent damage that would subject a parcel owner to civil liability. 
(9)  The board of commissioners is responsible for the protection and preservation of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community, and the environment and finds that it is in the best interest of the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the county and the community at large and the environment to proceed with the development, implementation, and operation of a utility for stormwater management accounted for in the county budget as a separate enterprise fund dedicated solely to stormwater management and to institute funding methods associated therewith. 
(10)  The county has undertaken a comprehensive review by staff and professional consultants of the need for, management of, and funding for, a stormwater utility. The county staff reports and the professional engineering analysis submitted to the county properly assess and define the stormwater management problems, needs, goals, program priorities and funding opportunities of the county. 
(11)  As a result, the county board of commissioners finds that a stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities, and the board of commissioners finds that a stormwater services fee provides the most practical and appropriate means of funding stormwater management services in the county.

However, no complaint may be filed against a candidate between the qualifying date for election of such candidate and the date of the candidate's general election or runoff election, if necessary. Complaints alleging violations during this period may be filed commencing upon the date immediately following the general election or runoff election, if necessary, and the six-month period shall run from that date. 
(3)  Upon receipt of the complaint, the county attorney shall immediately deliver the complaint to the hearing officer who shall review the complaint to determine if it meets the technical requirements set forth in subsections (a)(1) and (2) of this section. If the complaint fails to meet these requirements, the hearing officer shall notify the person who filed the complaint and he shall have ten days from the date of notice to correct and re-file the same directly with the hearing officer. A complaint which fails to satisfy the technical requirements of this article following one amendment shall be dismissed. 
(4)  If the complaint meets all of the technical requirements of this article, the hearing officer shall forward the complaint to the county attorney within five days of his decision or as soon thereafter as practicable. 
(5)  Within five days after receiving the complaint from the hearing officer, the county attorney shall forward the complaint to the board of commissioners, the district attorney, the president of the Gwinnett County Bar Association, the chairman of the local government section of the State Bar of Georgia, and the employee who is the subject of the ethics complaint. Each such appointing authority shall appoint its member to the ethics board within 30 days after receiving the complaint or as soon thereafter as practicable. 
(6)  The ethics board shall consist of one member appointed by the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners, one member appointed by the district attorney from the roll of grand jurors then in session, one member appointed by the president of the Gwinnett County Bar Association who is a member of the Gwinnett County Bar Association, one member appointed by the chairman of the local government section of the State Bar of Georgia who is a member of the local government section of the State Bar of Georgia, and one member appointed by the official or employee who is the subject of the ethics complaint.

(3)  The chairman of the ethics board shall determine when it shall meet and the number of meetings and hearings necessary to investigate the complaint. 
(4)  Three members of the board of ethics shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and for voting purposes. The chairman shall be entitled to the same voting rights as other members. 
(5)  At the conclusion of the investigation, the ethics board shall deliberate upon the evidence gathered and shall determine its findings by majority vote. The board shall find that each alleged violation is either "sustained" or "not-sustained." Findings that a violation of this article has occurred shall be based upon the preponderance of the evidence. The board's findings shall be reduced to writing and provided to the parties, to the county board of commissioners and to the office of the appropriate prosecutorial agency if the board finds evidence of possible criminal violations. It shall further be the duty of the ethics board to make non-binding recommendations to the board of commissioners as to the appropriate penalties to be administered under section 54-38 for sustained violations of this article and for other operational or remedial measures which would prevent further violations of a like nature. 
(c)  Enforcement. In the event that the ethics board finds that one or more violations of the county code of ethics has occurred, the board of commissioners, at a public hearing within 30 days of the rendering of the board's finding and recommendations, may, by a majority vote, decide that no action is to be taken, or may decide to take any action consistent with state law including those set forth in section 54-38.

(3)  The ethics board shall be a temporary board for the specific purpose of investigating a complaint which has been approved by the hearing officer and all other like complaints which have been properly filed while the board is in session. The ethics board should whenever possible, endeavor to consolidate for a single hearing all ethics complaints filed contemporaneously against the same employee, official, individual, or entity which arise out of a common nucleus of operative facts. The board shall expire upon disposition of the complaint or complaints for which it was created or which it was otherwise authorized to hear. 
(4)  Subject to budgetary constraints, the ethics board shall be provided sufficient meeting space and other reasonable supportive services, including access to legal counsel by the county governing authority to carry out its duties required under this article.

(i)  The right of a person to a prompt and equitable resolution of the complaint filed hereunder shall not be impaired by the person's pursuit of other remedies such as the filing of a section 504 complaint with the responsible federal department or agency. Utilization of this grievance procedure is not prerequisite to the pursuit of other remedies. 
(j)  These rules shall be construed to protect the substantive rights of interested persons, to meet appropriate due process standards, and to assure that the board of commissioners complies with section 504 and implementing regulations.
