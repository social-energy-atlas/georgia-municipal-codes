         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Midway, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1955 Code, as supplemented through February 13, 1994, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1955 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Sandra S. Fox, Senior Code Attorney, and Amy Norton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Clemontine Washington, Mayor, and Lynette G. Cook-Osborne, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  --- (1) --- 
                  Editor's note— The City of Midway, Georgia, was originally incorporated as the Town of Midway, Georgia, by 1925 Ga. Laws (Act No. 110), page 1189. The original town Charter was subsequently amended and ultimately repealed, and a new Charter enacted for the City of Midway, Georgia, which act is printed herein. Amendments are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original act. A uniform system of headings, catchlines, numbering, punctuation and capitalization has been used. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation and any material in brackets [ ] has been added as necessary for clarity.

                  (4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ to ____________ " (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code). 
                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

                  It shall be unlawful for any person in the city to change or amend by additions or deletions, any part or portion thereof, or to alter or tamper with this Code in any manner except by ordinance or other official act of the mayor and council which will cause the law of the city to be misrepresented thereby.

                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. of 4-14-2008, art. 1, § B) 
                  Sec. 12-22. - Purpose and intent. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD), as corrected in 1929, means a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after September 30, 1981, the effective date of the initial FIRM, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, the term "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after September 14, 1981, (the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the city) and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after September 14, 1981. 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD), as corrected in 1988, means a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
                  (1)  Built on a single chassis; 
                  (2)  400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
                  (3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
                  (4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, or a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. The term "substantial improvement" includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include either: 
                  (1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to ensure safe living conditions; or 
                  (2)  Any alteration of an historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, the term "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the structure commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the city's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  (8)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
                  (9)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters and effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
                  (10)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances. 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  DIVISION 3. - FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 12-86. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure. 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
                  (3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
                  (4)  All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions; 
                  b.  So as not to violate the lowest floor criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. Any additions to the manufactured home have to be similarly anchored. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters. 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. 
                  a.  Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of subsection 12-86; 
                  b.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 12-55(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved: 
                  1.  On individual lots or parcels; 
                  2.  In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions; 
                  3.  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or 
                  4.  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood; 
                  must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an either existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (3) of this section. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 12-26 are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection (4)(a) of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division. 
                  c.  The placement of any manufactured home except in an existing manufactured home park or existing manufactured home subdivision is prohibited. 
                  (Ord. of 4-14-2008, art. 4, § B) 
                  Sec. 12-88. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-Zones). 
                  (a)  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 12-26 where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-Zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 12-26 then the administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of division 3. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall apply. 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 25 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one-foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 12-86(4). All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  (b)  The administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (Ord. of 4-14-2008, art. 4, § C) 
                  Sec. 12-89. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO-Zones). 
                  Areas of special flood hazard established in section 12-26 may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 12-86(4). The administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in sections 12-54(b)(1)(c) and(b)(2). 
                  (3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure. 
                  (Ord. of 4-14-2008, art. 4, § D) 
                  Sec. 12-90. - Coastal high hazard areas (V-Zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 12-26 are areas designated as coastal high hazard areas (V-Zones). These areas have special flood hazards associated with wave action and storm surge, therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be located landward of the reach of mean high tide; 
                  (2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be elevated on piles, columns, or sheer walls parallel to the flow of water so that the bottom of the lowest supporting horizontal structural member (excluding pilings or columns) is located no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation level. All space below the lowest supporting member shall remain free of obstruction. Open lattice work or decorative screening may be permitted for aesthetic purposes only and must be designed to wash away in the event of abnormal wave action and in accordance with subsection (6) of this section; 
                  (3)  All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be securely anchored on pilings, columns, or sheer walls; 
                  (4)  All pile and column foundations and the structures attached thereto shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the combined effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components, both (non-structural and structural). Water loading values shall equal or exceed those of the base flood. Wind loading values shall be in accordance with the most current edition of the standard building code; 
                  (5)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design, specifications and plans for construction are in compliance with the provisions contained in subsection (2) to (4) of this section; 
                  (6)  All space below the lowest horizontal supporting member must remain free of obstruction. Open lattice work or decorative screening may be permitted for aesthetic purposes only and must be designed to wash away in the event of abnormal wave action without causing structural damage to the supporting foundation or elevated portion of the structure. The following design specifications are allowed: 
                  a.  No solid walls shall be allowed; 
                  b.  Material shall consist of lattice or mesh screening only; 
                  c.  If aesthetic lattice work or screening is utilized, any enclosed space shall not be used for human habitation, but shall be designed to be used only for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises; 
                  (7)  Prior to construction, plans for any structures having latticework or decorative screening must be submitted to the administrator for approval; 
                  (8)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to any structure shall not enclose the space below the lowest floor except with latticework or decorative screening, as provided in this section; 
                  (9)  There shall be no fill used as structural support. Non-compacted fill may be used around the perimeter of a building for landscaping/aesthetic purposes provided the fill will wash out from storm surge (thereby rendering the building free of obstruction) prior to generating excessive loading forces, ramping effects, or wave deflection. The administrator shall approve design plans for landscaping/aesthetic fill only after the applicant has provided an analysis by an engineer, architect, and/or soil scientist, which demonstrates that the following factors have been fully considered: 
                  a.  Particle composition of fill material does not have a tendency for excessive natural compaction; 
                  b.  Volume and distribution of fill will not cause wave defection to adjacent properties; and 
                  c.  Slope of fill will not cause wave run-up or ramping; 
                  (10)  There shall be no alteration of sand dunes or mangrove stands, which would increase potential flood damage; and 
                  (11)  Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes), except in an existing manufactured homes park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of this section are met. 
                  (Ord. of 4-14-2008, art. 4, § E) 
                  Sec. 12-91. - Standards for subdivisions. 
                  (a)  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall: 
                  (1)  Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. 
                  (2)  Have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
                  (3)  Have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
                  (b)  For any subdivision and/or development including manufactured home parks within a floodplain, base flood elevation data shall be established in accordance with FEMA standards. Any changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted to FEMA for review as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. Upon completion of the project, the developer is responsible for submitting the "as-built" data to FEMA in order to obtain the final LOMR.

                  ARTICLE II. - PLAT PROCEDURE 

                  Sec. 30-45. - Five-step review. 
                  (a)  The procedure for review and approval of a subdivision plat consists of five separate steps. These are: 
                  (1)  Review of sketch plan by planning commission. 
                  (2)  Review and recommendation of preliminary plat approval by planning commission. 
                  (3)  Review and approval of preliminary plat by city council. 
                  (4)  Review and recommendation of final plat by planning commission. 
                  (5)  Review and approval of final plat by city council. 
                  (b)  Step (1) may, and steps (2) and (3) shall, be completed prior to making any street improvement, installing any utilities or selling any lots. Steps (3) and (4) shall be completed prior to the sale of any lots in the proposed subdivision. The site proposed to be subdivided must be zoned in the appropriate residential, commercial, industrial, planned development, or other nonagricultural zoning district prior to the completion of step (2). 
                  (Ord. No. 2007-014, § 4.1, 5-14-2007) 
                  Sec. 30-46. - Sketch plan review procedures. 
                  Prior to the filing of a preliminary plat, the subdivider may submit to the planning commission or its representative a simple sketch plan of the proposed subdivision. The sketch plan may be a simple free-hand drawing. Included with the sketch plan should be a sketch map, which shows the subdivision in relation to the surrounding area. The purpose of the sketch plan is to assist the subdivider prior to extensive site planning for the preparation of the preliminary plat and enable the subdivider to become familiar with the regulations affecting the land to be subdivided. The planning commission shall review and approve, disapprove, or approve with modification the sketch plan within 15 days from the meeting at which it is presented. Pertinent comments and recommendations shall be noted in the minutes of the planning commission meeting. 
                  (Ord. No. 2007-014, § 4.2.1, 5-14-2007) 
                  Sec. 30-47. - Preliminary plat procedures. 
                  (a)  Application for preliminary approval of a subdivision plat shall be submitted to the secretary of the planning commission at least 25 days prior to the regularly scheduled meeting date of the planning commission. The plat of the subdivision shall be submitted in six black-line or blue-line prints and shall be such as to meet the minimum requirements contained herein. Any preliminary plat submitted to the planning commission shall contain the name and address of the subdivider (or subdivider's designee) to whom notice of hearing may be sent; and no preliminary plat shall be acted upon by the planning commission without affording a hearing thereon, notice of time and place of which shall be sent by registered or certified mail to the address not less than five days before the date fixed therefor. The planning commission may request additional copies of the plat and supplemental information. 
                  (b)  The copies shall be distributed as required by section 30-83(4) and additionally as deemed necessary by the secretary of the planning commission. The person or agency to which a copy of the preliminary plat is directed, shall review the preliminary plat and indicate any required changes or comments on the plat and submit to the planning commission prior to the formal presentation of the preliminary plat. 
                  (c)  The planning commission shall examine the preliminary plat to determine if it meets all requirements of these regulations, has approval of the health department, has been reviewed and approved by the coastal soil and water conservation district, and that the design of the roadways, drainage structures, public water and sewerage systems and other facilities related to the subdivision have been reviewed and approved by the county engineer or other designated official. 
                  (d)  If water and or sewerage systems, not connected to a municipal system, are to be installed, the subdivider is to indicate who will own the systems, who will operate the systems and what assurance will be given to the city council for continued operation. 
                  (e)  The planning commission shall act on the preliminary plat within 90 days after formal submission. Failure of the planning commission to act within 90 days after formal submission of the preliminary plat shall be deemed to constitute approval and certificate to that effect shall be issued by the planning commission on demand; provided, however, that the subdivider may waive this requirement and consent in writing to the extension of such period. The action of the commission shall be recorded in the minutes of the commission meeting. 
                  (f)  The planning commission shall recommend approval or disapproval of the preliminary plat to the city council. In the event a preliminary plat is disapproved, the grounds for such disapproval shall be noted in the minutes of the planning commission and a copy of such minutes provided to the subdivider. 
                  (g)  Preliminary approval of the subdivision plat shall be noted on the plat and certified by the secretary of the planning commission on authorization by city council. Also noted shall be the date on which the city council granted preliminary approval and the date of written notification to the subdivider or subdivider's authorized agent. Failure of a subdivider to initiate any development within 18 months from the approval of the preliminary plat will require resubmittal of the preliminary plat to the planning commission for approval. The developer shall not initiate action to change any of the existing conditions reported on the preliminary plat as required by subsection 30-83(2) until the preliminary plat has been approved. 
                  (h)  Approval of a preliminary subdivision plat shall not constitute approval of the final subdivision plat. Preliminary approval shall constitute approval of the proposed widths and alignments of streets and the dimensions and shapes of lots. Application for approval of the final plat will be considered only after the requirements for final plat approval as specified herein have been fulfilled and after all other specified conditions have been met.

(A "family member" is defined as the applicant's spouse, natural or adopted children, stepchildren, father, mother, sister, brother or grandchildren.) In all cases the family conveyance exception must be approved by the city council, however, this exemption for the original parcel and the parcels resulting for the subdivision will be allowed only one time. Furthermore, family subdivisions must comply with the following requirements: 
                  a.  Access roads into the subdivision must be accessible to all lots. The road shall be in a 60-foot right-of-way and shall have a minimum of two standard travel lanes. 
                  b.  The lot size and required frontage must meet the requirements of the zoning of the property. 
                  c.  Subdivision must be accompanied by an affidavit that the road is nonconforming. 
                  d.  Should more than 50 percent of the property resulting from the subdivision exemption be conveyed to someone other than a certified family member, the required improvements in this article must be installed at the expense of the property owner. The following requirements shall apply: 
                  1.  No building permit shall be issued until such improvements are complete and accepted by the city council. 
                  2.  No manufactured home or other structure shall be placed on any lot the subdivision until such required improvements are complete and accepted by the city council. 
                  3.  No lot of the subdivision shall be occupied or inhabited until such improvements are complete and accepted by the city council. 
                  (20)  Permanent reference points. Prior to the approval of the final plat, all of the subdivision's permanent reference points shall have been placed in accordance with the following requirements:

                  ARTICLE IV. - REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS 

                  Sec. 30-116. - Required improvements. 
                  A well designed subdivision means little to a prospective lot buyer until such buyer can see actual physical transformation of raw land into lots with all necessary improvements provided. Likewise, a well-designed subdivision is not an asset to the city until the necessary improvements have been installed. In order that prospective lot purchasers may get useable products and new subdivisions may be an asset rather than a liability to the city, the subdivider shall install and/or pay for the improvements required by these regulations necessary to serve the subdivision prior to the approval of the final plat. 
                  (1)  Natural gas. When gas lines are located in a street right-of-way, where possible, such lines shall be located outside the portion of the street to be surfaced to prevent having to cut into the paved surface to serve abutting properties. 
                  (2)  Water supply. All lots, tracts or parcels must be served by a water source. The water source may be an individual water system, a municipal water system or a city water system. The water source must be approved by the city council, the health department and, when necessary, the environmental protection division of the state department of natural resources. All required improvements must meet the requirements of these agencies. Individual wells shall be installed in accordance with the rules and administrative regulations of the county health department. Subdivisions located near or adjacent to an existing municipal water supply shall connect to that water supply. Subdivisions located adjacent to an existing private water supply may connect to that water supply provided that the owner agrees to the connection in writing, that the proposed system is approved as mentioned above, and that the existing system is capable of providing an adequate supply of water. When the water main is located in the street to serve the abutting lots a water service line shall be stubbed out to the property line to serve each lot before the street is surfaced. The location of each service line shall be marked clearly on the record drawings and submitted to the county. 
                  (3)  Sanitary sewerage. A sanitary sewerage system shall be installed in a subdivision with more than 50 lots or with potential for more than 50 lots. A variance from this requirement may be granted if the soil conditions are able to support the required number of on-site sewage disposal units. Variance requests must be accompanied by a detailed report by a qualified engineer attesting the conditions of the site. If a sanitary sewerage system is installed in a subdivision, the proposed sewerage system shall be installed in accordance with the plans and specifications approved by the county engineer, and the requirements of the environmental protection division of the state department of natural resources. Individual septic systems shall be installed in accordance with the approved plans and specifications and in accordance with the rules and administrative regulations of the county health department. Subdivisions located near or adjacent to an existing municipal sanitary sewerage system may connect to that system provided that the municipality agrees to the connection in writing. Subdivisions located near or adjacent to a private sewerage system may connect to that system provided that the owner agrees to the connection in writing, that the extension is reviewed and approved as mentioned above and that the existing system is capable of providing adequate treatment and disposal. When the sewer line is located in a street right-of-way and it will be necessary to cut into the street surface to serve the abutting lots, a connection shall be stubbed out to the property line to serve each lot prior to surfacing the street. The location of each service line shall be marked clearly on the record drawings and submitted to the county. 
                  (4)  Sewage disposal systems. Prior to the construction of any city sewerage disposal system such as private septic tanks, an oxidation pond or other facility, the location, size plans, and specifications of such a facility shall be approved by and be in accordance with the rules and administrative regulations of the planning commission, the county engineer, the county health department, and the environmental protection division of the state department of natural resources. 
                  (5)  Curbs and gutters. Concrete curbs and gutters or paved valley type gutters shall be installed along new roadways. Existing roadways may be developed and or paved without curbs and gutters or paved valley type gutters. All concrete curbs or paved valley type gutters shall be installed in accordance with the approved plans and standard specifications. All streets designated and shown shall be constructed and surfaced with the requirements of this article and with the details, drawings and specifications as published by the county engineering department, herein referred to as the "standard specifications." Copies of the standard specifications are on file in the county engineering department. Higher standards than those required by the standard specifications may be required by the planning commission to provide adequately for unusual soil conditions, extraordinary traffic volume or other abnormal conditions. Approval of the developer's plans by the county engineer and planning commission is required. 
                  (6)  Street grading and surfacing (local streets). Street grading, base preparation and surfacing of local streets shall be carried out in accordance with the approved plans and specifications. Grading, base preparation, and surfacing of local collection and arterial streets shall be installed in accordance with the standard specifications. Approval of the developer's plans by the county engineer and planning commission is required. 
                  (7)  Storm drainage. An adequate drainage system, including necessary open ditches, pipes, culverts, storm sewers, storm drains, drop inlets, bridges, and other necessary appurtenances shall be installed by the subdivider in accordance with the plans, standard specifications, and drainage ordinance. Approval of the developer's plans by the county engineer and planning commission is required. 
                  (8)  Signage. Street name signs shall be installed at all intersections within a subdivision. Traffic signs shall be installed in accordance with the Uniform Manual of Traffic Control Devices. The planning commission and the city council shall approve the location and design. 
                  (9)  Topsoil. Topsoil shall not be removed from residential lots or used as spoil, but shall be redistributed so as to provide at least six inches of cover on the lots and at least four inches of cover between sidewalks and curbs, and shall be stabilized by seeding or planting. 
                  (10)  Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be installed in all approved subdivisions in accordance with section 30-146(s).

                  In lieu of requiring the completion of all required improvements prior to the acceptance of a final plat, the county may, at its discretion, accept a bond or guarantee from the subdivider, whereby the subdivider shall guarantee to complete all required improvements by this article or otherwise specified by the planning commission, to the satisfaction of the county. The amount of the guarantee shall be 110 percent of the construction cost of the specific improvements. The developer's engineer shall estimate cost for construction or a copy of the construction contract shall be provided. The amount of the guarantee must be approved as adequate to the county administrator or his representative. The time of guarantee shall be 12 months and shall automatically renew until released by the city council. The guarantee shall be in the form of one of the following alternatives: 
                  (1)  Performance bond. 
                  (2)  Irrevocable letter of credit and its accompanying agreement. 
                  (3)  Cash bond and escrow agreement. 
                  (4)  Such other security arrangements as may be approved by the county attorney.

                  Sec. 30-119. - Inspections. 
                  All subdivisions within the territorial jurisdiction of the county shall be inspected and approved by the county engineer and/or his authorized representative. Sufficient inspections shall be made to ensure compliance with the specifications set forth in these regulations. A registered engineer, employed by the developer, shall also certify in writing to the city council that he has inspected each and all phases of the development and finds all construction, including, but not limited to, the installation of all drainage ways, streets, and water and sewerage systems to be in compliance with the approved plans and specifications and the standard specifications as set forth in these regulations.

                  Sec. 30-122. - Maintenance bond. 
                  (a)  A maintenance bond is required for county acceptance of the completed paving, drainage, water and sewer facilities prior to filing of the final plat. The bond shall be written in the amount of 15 percent of the construction cost of the work. The amount of the maintenance bond shall be reviewed and approved by the county engineer as sufficient to cover maintenance. The maintenance bond shall guarantee the work for a period of two years, from the date of acceptance of the work. 
                  (b)  During the period of the two-year guarantee, any maintenance, replacement or repair required will be the responsibility of the developer. The required improvements will be inspected by the developer at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the maintenance bond. Any required maintenance shall be completed prior to release of the bond. If maintenance is not completed, the bond will be forfeited to the city council. Upon the expiration of the two-year period, the county will assume maintenance of the accepted improvements. Prior acceptance by the county shall not relieve the developer of responsibility for subsequent failures occurring within the period of the two-year guarantee. If at any time during the two-year period, the developer fails to make prompt repairs or fails to maintain the road to the satisfaction of the city council, the city council may inform the developer and utilize bond funds or guarantee funds as needed.

                  (b)  Continuation of adjoining street system. The proposed street layout shall be coordinated with the street system of the surrounding area. Where possible, existing major streets shall be extended. 
                  (c)  Access to adjacent properties. Where it is desirable to provide for street access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundary of such property and a temporary turn-around shall be provided. Houses fronting on minor streets shall have access from minor streets only. 
                  (d)  Street names. Proposed streets, which are obviously in alignment with other existing and named streets, shall bear the assigned name of the existing streets. In no case shall the name of the proposed streets duplicate or be phonetically similar to existing street names, irrespective of the use of suffix, street, avenue, boulevard, drive, place, court, etc. It shall be unlawful for any person in laying out any new street or road to name such street or road on any plat by marking, or in any deed or instrument, without first getting approval of the planning commission. The planning commission shall coordinate or cause to be coordinated, with the emergency 911 department for approval of street names. 
                  (e)  Minor streets. Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through-traffic will be discouraged. 
                  (f)  Private streets. There shall be no private streets platted in any subdivision. Private streets are allowed in planned developments and experimental developments. 
                  (g)  Trees. Requirements of the landscape ordinance must be met. 
                  (h)  Railroads and highways (freeways, expressways). Railroad rights-of-way and limited access highways where so located as to affect the subdivision of adjoining lands shall be treated as follows: 
                  (1)  In residential districts, a buffer strip not less than 25 feet in depth in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall be provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited access highway. This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be so designated on the plat: 
                  "This strip is reserved for the planting of trees and shrubs by the owner. The placement of structures hereon is prohibited." 
                  (2)  In districts zoned for business, commercial, or industrial uses, the nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad shall, wherever practical, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites. 
                  (3)  All other streets, which are parallel to the railroad, when intersecting a street that crosses the railroad at grade, shall, to the extent practicable, be at a distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients. 
                  (i)  Reserved strips prohibited. Reserved strips at the terminus of a new street shall be prohibited. 
                  (j)  Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets by less than 150 feet shall be prohibited.

Temporary dead-end streets shall be provided with a turn-around having a 30-foot radius. 
                  (m)  Alleys. Service alleys or drives may be required in multiple dwelling, commercial and industrial developments and shall have a minimum surface treatment width of 15 feet, but shall not be provided in one-family and two-family residential developments unless the subdivider provides evidence satisfactory to the planning commission of the need for alleys. 
                  (n)  Paving requirements. All streets must be prepared and paved according to the following methods or by equivalent methods that are acceptable to the county: 
                  (1)  Subgrade. The subgrade shall be 24 inches of compacted subgrade material compacted to 95 percent density. 
                  (2)  Base. The base shall consist of a graded aggregate base course screened 1½ inches or smaller with a thickness of six inches after being thoroughly compacted and constructed. 
                  a.  All materials shall be secured from an approved source and shall conform to state department of highway minimum acceptable standards for this area. 
                  b.  As soon as the base material has been spread and mixed, the base shall be brought to approximate line, grade and cross-section and then rolled with a sheepsfoot roller until the roller walks out and finally with a pneumatic tire or general purpose roller until full thickness of the base course has been compacted thoroughly. Defects shall be remedied as soon as they are discovered. New materials shall be added if necessary and defective portions shall be entirely removed.

                  d.  Will the proposed zoning change result in a use which will or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities, or schools? 
                  e.  Will the proposed zoning change be in conformity with the policy and intent of the city's land use plan as expressed in the official zoning map and the official zoning chapter?

                  g.  Is this request a logical extension of a zoning boundary which would improve the pattern of uses in the general area and conform to the comprehensive plan? 
                  h.  Is this spot zoning and generally unrelated to either existing zoning or the pattern of development of the area, and contrary to the intent of the comprehensive plan? 
                  i.  Would granting this request extend to the applicant development rights denied to others similarly situated in the same area? 
                  j.  Does this request have the potential of achieving short-term development goals to the disadvantage of long-term development goals? 
                  k.  Could this request have a "domino effect," in that it becomes the opening wedge for further rapid growth, urbanization, or other land-use change beyond what is indicated in the existing land use plan? 
                  l.  Could a change in classification adversely affect market values or tax rates of nearby properties?

                  (b)  Procedure. Appeals may be made by any person, aggrieved or affected by the decision of the planning commission or by the decision of the building and zoning inspector or any other officer charged with enforcement of the provisions of the zoning chapter where an error is alleged in such order, requirement, decision or determination. Such appeal must be made within 20 days after the decision, by filing with the building and zoning inspector, a written notice of appeal specifying the grounds therefor. The building and zoning inspector shall arrange for the public notices in accordance with section 38-373(1) and shall bring the appeal before the city council at its next meeting following such notices. 
                  (c)  Stay of proceedings. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the building and zoning inspector shall certify to the city council after the notice of appeal has been filed with it, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in such inspector's opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the city council or by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon petition of the aggrieved or affected party, after notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken, and upon due cause shown for such restraining order. 
                  (d)  Filing. The city council may require the applicant to furnish such information as it deems necessary, when filing an application or appeal, and may require specific forms to be used.

                  (1)  Public notice. Notice given not more than 30 days and not less than 15 days in advance of the public. Such notice shall be published once each week for two successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county.

The city council's decision shall be binding on the building and zoning inspector, and such inspector shall incorporate the terms and conditions of the same in any permit issued, if appropriate. 
                  (Ord. of 8-11-1997, art. XI, § 2)
