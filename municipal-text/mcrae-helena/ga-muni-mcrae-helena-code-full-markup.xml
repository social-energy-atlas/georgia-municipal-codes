PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of McRae-Helena, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were ordinances adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Ramona Connors, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Liz McLean, City Manager, Mr. Jason Davis, City Attorney, and Ms. Heather Livingston, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  On or before a date fixed by the city council but not later than 45 days prior to the beginning of each fiscal year, the mayor or, where a city manager has been appointed, the city manager shall submit to the city council a proposed operating budget for the ensuing fiscal year. The budget shall be accompanied by a message from the mayor or city manager, as appropriate, containing a statement of the general fiscal policies of the city, the important features of the budget, explanations of major changes recommended for the next fiscal year, a general summary of the budget, and other pertinent comments and information. The operating budget and the capital budget provided for in this charter, the budget message, and all supporting documents shall be filed in the office of the city clerk and shall be open to public inspection. 
                  SECTION 6.26. - Action by city council on budget. 
                  (a)  The city council may amend the operating budget proposed by the mayor or the city manager, as the case may be; except that the budget as finally amended and adopted shall provide for all expenditures required by state law or by other provisions of this charter and for all debt service requirements for the ensuing fiscal year, and the total appropriations from any fund shall not exceed the estimated fund balance, reserves, and revenues. 
                  (b)  The city council by ordinance shall adopt the final operating budget for the ensuing fiscal year not later than the fifteenth day of December of each year. If the city council fails to adopt the budget by this date, the amounts appropriated for operation for the current fiscal year shall be deemed adopted for the ensuing fiscal year on a month-to-month basis, with all items prorated accordingly until such time as the city council adopts a budget for the ensuing fiscal year. Adoption of the budget shall take the form of an appropriations ordinance setting out the estimated revenues in detail by sources and making appropriations according to fund and by organizational unit, purpose, or activity as set out in the budget preparation ordinance adopted pursuant to Section 6.24 of this charter. 
                  (c)  The amount set out in the adopted operating budget for each organizational unit shall constitute the annual appropriation for such, and no expenditure shall be made or encumbrance created in excess of the otherwise unencumbered balance of the appropriations or allotment thereof to which it is chargeable. 
                  SECTION 6.27. - Tax levies. 
                  The city council shall levy by ordinance such taxes as are necessary. The taxes and tax rates set by such ordinances shall be such that reasonable estimates of revenues from such levy shall at least be sufficient, together with other anticipated revenues, fund balances, and applicable reserves, to equal the total amount appropriated for each of the several funds set forth in the annual operating budget for defraying the expenses of the general government of the city. 
                  SECTION 6.28. - Changes in appropriations. 
                  The city council by ordinance may make changes in the appropriations contained in the current operating budget at any regular meeting or special or emergency meeting called for such purpose, but any additional appropriations may be made only from an existing unexpended surplus. 
                  SECTION 6.29. - Capital budget. 
                  (a)  On or before the date fixed by the city council but no later than 45 days prior to the beginning of each fiscal year, the mayor or, if a city manager has been appointed, the city manager shall submit to the city council a proposed capital improvements plan with a recommended capital budget containing the means of financing the improvements proposed for the ensuing fiscal year. The city council shall have power to accept, with or without amendments, or reject the proposed plan and proposed budget. The city council shall not authorize an expenditure for the construction of any building, structure, work, or improvement unless the appropriations for such project are included in the capital budget, except to meet a public emergency as provided in Section 2.24 of this charter. 
                  (b)  The city council shall adopt by ordinance the final capital budget for the ensuing fiscal year not later than the fifteenth day of December of each year. No appropriation provided for in a prior capital budget shall lapse until the purpose for which the appropriation was made shall have been accomplished or abandoned; provided, however, the mayor or the city manager, as the case may be, may submit amendments to the capital budget at any time during the fiscal year, accompanied by recommendations. Any such amendments to the capital budget shall become effective only upon adoption by ordinance. 
                  SECTION 6.30. - Independent audit. 
                  There shall be an annual independent audit of all city accounts, funds, and financial transactions by a certified public accountant selected by the city council. The audit shall be conducted according to generally accepted auditing principles. Any audit of any funds by the state or federal governments may be accepted as satisfying the requirements of this charter. Copies of annual audit reports shall be available at printing costs to the public. 
                  SECTION 6.31. - Contracting procedures. 
                  No contract with the city shall be binding on the city unless: 
                  (1)  It is in writing; 
                  (2)  It is reviewed by the city attorney to the extent required by ordinances that may be adopted by the council from time to time; and 
                  (3)  It is made or authorized by the city council and such approval is entered in the city council journal of proceedings pursuant to Section 2.20 of this charter. 
                  SECTION 6.32. - Centralized purchasing. 
                  The city council shall by ordinance prescribe procedures for a system of centralized purchasing for the city. 
                  SECTION 6.33. - Sale and lease of city property. 
                  (a)  The city council may sell and convey or lease any real or personal property owned or held by the city for governmental or other purposes as now or hereafter provided by law. 
                  (b)  The city council may quitclaim any rights it may have in property not needed for public purposes upon report by the mayor or the city manager, as appropriate, and adoption of a resolution, both finding that the property is not needed for public or other purposes and that the interest of the city has no readily ascertainable monetary value. 
                  (c)  Whenever in opening, extending, or widening any street, avenue, alley, or public place of the city, a small parcel or tract of land is cut off or separated by such work from a larger tract or boundary of land owned by the city, the city council may authorize the mayor or city manager, as appropriate, to sell and convey such cut-off or separated parcel or tract of land to an abutting or adjoining property owner or owners where such sale and conveyance facilitates the enjoyment of the highest and best use of the abutting owner's property. Included in the sales contract shall be a provision for the rights of way of such street, avenue, alley, or public place. Each abutting property owner shall be notified of the availability of the property and given the opportunity to purchase such property under such terms and conditions as set out by ordinance. All deeds and conveyances heretofore and hereafter so executed and delivered shall convey all title and interest the city has in such property, notwithstanding the fact that no public sale after advertisement was or is hereafter made.

                  (b) [(c)]  Except as otherwise provided by this charter, contracts, orders, leases, bonds, and other obligations or instruments entered into by the City of Helena or for its benefit prior to the effective date of this charter shall continue in effect according to the terms thereof as obligations and rights of the City of McRae-Helena; provided, however, that, in order to be valid, any obligation created by the City of Helena to become effective after the date of approval of this charter and prior to the effective date of this charter shall be ratified by the city council of the City of McRae-Helena within six months following the effective date of this charter. 
                  (c) [(d)]  No pending action or proceeding of any nature, whether civil, criminal, judicial, administrative, or other, by or against the City of McRae or the City of Helena or an agency or department thereof shall be abated or otherwise affected by the adoption of this charter, and the City of McRae-Helena shall stand substituted as a party in lieu thereof.

A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive, permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the council or adopted by initiative and referendum during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages that have become obsolete or partially obsolete. The new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. Charter amendments may be included in like manner. 
                  (b)  In the preparation of a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code that have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
                  (c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified Code. For example, the codifier may: 
                  (1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
                  (2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles; 
                  (3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers; 
                  (4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _____ through _____" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and 
                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
                  Sec. 1-7. - Severability of parts of Code. 
                  It is declared to be the intention of the city council that the sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this Code are severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this Code shall be declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, such unconstitutionality shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs, and sections of this Code. If any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this Code shall be declared inapplicable in any situation by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment or degree shall not affect the applicability of such phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph, and section to other situations. 
                  Sec. 1-8. - Penalties for violation of Code. 
                  (a)  In this section, the term "violation of this Code" means: 
                  (1)  Doing an act that is prohibited or made or declared to be an unlawful act, an offense, or a violation of this Code by ordinance or by rule or regulation authorized by ordinance; 
                  (2)  Failure to perform an act that is required to be performed by ordinance, rule, or regulation authorized by ordinance; or 
                  (3)  Failure to perform an act if the failure is declared a violation of this Code, an offense, or an unlawful omission by ordinance, rule, or regulation authorized by ordinance. 
                  (b)  The term "violation of this Code" does not include the failure of a city officer or city employee to perform an official duty, unless it is provided that failure to perform the duty is to be punished as provided in this section or it is clear from the context of this Code that it is the intent of the city to impose the penalty provided for in this section upon the city officer or city employee. 
                  (c)  Except as otherwise provided, a person convicted of a violation of this Code shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000.00, imprisonment for a term not exceeding 180 days, alternative sentencing as provided by law, or any combination thereof. 
                  (d)  Except as otherwise provided: 
                  (1)  With respect to violations that are continuous with respect to time, each day that the violation continues is a separate offense. 
                  (2)  As to other violations, each act is a separate offense. 
                  (e)  Violations of this Code that are continuous with respect to time are a public nuisance and may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief and by such other means as are provided by law.

                  Subdivision I. - In General 

                  Sec. 2-64. - Short title. 
                  This division shall be referred to as the "Code of Ethics for the City of McRae-Helena." 
                  (Ord. No. O-012-15, 6-11-2015) 
                  Sec. 2-65. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Benefit means anything, whether or not the same has monetary value, perceived or intended by either the offeror or the recipient to be sufficient in value to either influence a public official in the performance or non-performance of a public duty or to induce the recipient to so influence some other public official. 
                  Board means the board of ethics for the city. 
                  City means the City of McRae-Helena, or, as is reasonably inferred, its agents, officers, or employees. 
                  Council member includes all city council members. 
                  Employee means any person who is a full-time or part-time employee of the city or one of its departments. 
                  Government means the city, or, as is reasonably inferred, its departments, agents, officers, or employees. 
                  Immediate family means a spouse, child, parent, or sibling of an elected official, appointed official, agent, or employee of the city. 
                  Incidental interest means an interest in a person, entity or property which is not a substantial interest as defined herein and which has insignificant value. 
                  Interest means any direct or indirect financial gain accruing to an elected or appointed official, agent or employee of the city, or to immediate family of the same, which is the result of a contract or transaction that is, or may be, the subject of an official act of action by, or with, the city. The term "interest" shall not mean any direct or indirect financial gain which is remote or insignificant. 
                  Public servant means any council member, employee, or agent of the city, as well as the mayor or mayor pro tem thereof and all employees, agents, and directors of any division or agency of the city. 
                  Remote interest means an interest of a person or entity, including a city official, who would be affected in the same way as the general public. For example, the interest of an official in the property tax rate, general city fees, city utility charges or a comprehensive zoning ordinance or similar matters is deemed remote to the extent that the official would be affected in common with the general public. 
                  Substantial interest means an interest, either directly or through a member of the immediate family, in another person or entity, where: 
                  (1)  The interest is ownership of five percent or more of the voting stock, shares or equity of the entity or ownership of $5,000.00 or more of the equity or market value of the entity; 
                  (2)  The funds received by the person from the other person or entity during the previous 12 months either equal or exceed:

                  b.  Ten percent of the recipient's gross income during that period, whichever is less; 
                  (3)  The person serves as a corporate officer or member of the board of directors or other governing board of a for-profit entity other than a corporate entity owned or created by the city council; or 
                  (4)  The person is a creditor, debtor, or guarantor of the other person or entity in an amount of $5,000.00 or more.

                  (3)  Any official who has a proprietary interest in an agency doing business with the city shall make that interest known in writing to the city council and the city clerk.

                  (m)  A city official shall not use his position in any way to coerce, or give the appearance of coercing, another person to provide any financial benefit to such official or persons within the official's immediate family, or those with whom the official has business or financial ties amounting to a substantial interest. 
                  (n)  A city official shall not order any goods and services for the city without prior official authorization for such an expenditure. No city official shall attempt to obligate the city nor give the impression of obligating the city without proper prior authorization. 
                  (o)  No city official shall draw travel funds or per diem from the city for attendance at meetings, seminars, training or other educational events and fail to attend such events without promptly reimbursing the city therefor.

                  Sec. 2-69. - Financial interests of public servants.

                  (c)  Public servants are required to disclose any potential conflict of interest that they may have in a matter upon the matter being raised for the first time. To avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest or a potential conflict of interest of a council member, once all questions relating to the conflict are answered to the satisfaction of the council, the member shall immediately leave the meeting room, unless the meeting in question is a public meeting. If the meeting is a public meeting, the member may remain in the area of the room occupied by the general public. Such member shall refrain from deliberation or decision on the matter. There shall be no requirement, however, that the member leave his seat in the event that the item in question is merely a consent agenda on which there is no deliberation if the member's conflict has been disclosed and he refrains from voting on the item. 
                  (d)  Any contract entered into in violation of this section may be voided by the city in an action commenced within three years of the date on which the city, or one of its departments, or its financial officer, knew, or should have known, that a violation of this section occurred. This subsection does not affect the application of any state statute. 
                  (e)  Aside from these restrictions, public servants are free to engage in lawful financial transactions to the same extent as private citizens.

                  (b)  A city official who serves as a corporate officer or member of the board of directors of a nonprofit entity must disclose his interest in said entity to the mayor and council prior to participating in a vote or decision regarding funding of the entity by or through the city.

Such information will become a part of the employee's official personal record. Employees are required to obtain approval prior to accepting outside employment. 
                  (c)  Any employee accepting or engaging in outside employment under the terms of this rule shall make arrangements with the outside employer to be available to respond immediately to any emergency call of duty whenever his department head or designated agent shall determine that the employee's services are necessary.

                  (b)  Upon receipt of a complaint in the proper form, the board of ethics shall review it to determine whether the complaint is unjustified, frivolous, patently unfounded or fails to state facts sufficient to invoke the disciplinary jurisdiction of the board and the city council. 
                  (c)  Upon completion of its investigation of a complaint, the board of ethics shall be empowered to dismiss those complaints which are unjustified, frivolous, patently unfounded or fails to state facts sufficient to invoke the disciplinary jurisdiction of the board and the city council; provided, however, that a rejection of such complaint by the board of ethics shall not deprive the complaining party of any action he might otherwise have at law or in equity against the respondent government servant. 
                  (d)  The board of ethics shall be empowered to conduct probable cause investigations, to take evidence and hold hearings to address the subject matter of the complaint. 
                  (e)  The board of ethics shall be empowered to adopt forms for formal complaints, subpoenas, notices, applications for reinstatement and any other written instruments necessary or desirable under these rules.

Service may be by personal service, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by statutory overnight delivery. A hearing shall be held within 60 calendar days after filing of the complaint. The board of ethics shall conduct hearings in accordance with the procedures and regulations it establishes but, in all circumstances, at least one hearing shall include the taking of testimony and the cross examination of available witnesses. The decision of the board of ethics shall be rendered to the mayor and council within seven calendar days after completion of the final hearing.

The city official subject to the inquiry shall also have the right but not the obligation of submitting evidence and calling witnesses. Failure to comply with any of the time deadlines in this section shall not invalidate any otherwise valid complaint or in any way affect the power or jurisdiction of the board of ethics or the city council to act upon any complaint. A hearing shall be held within 60 days after filing of the complaint. At the hearing, the board of ethics shall inquire into the reasons therefor and may extend the hearing date for a reasonable time to allow 30 days' notice. 
                  (g)  The board of ethics shall hold hearings in accordance with rules and regulations that it establishes, but, in all circumstances, the hearing shall include the taking of testimony and the cross examination of witnesses.

                  (i)  If the board of ethics finds that, by a preponderance of the evidence, the accused public servant has violated this division, the city council shall then, at its next regularly scheduled meeting, or at a special meeting duly called, establish a fair penalty for the violation, as established herein. This penalty shall be reduced to writing within three business days and a copy provided to the accused public servant. 
                  (j)  To discourage the filing of ethics complaints solely for political purposes, complaints will not be accepted against a person seeking election as a city official, whether currently serving as a city official or not, from the date qualifying opens for the elected office at issue through the date the election results for that office are certified. The time for filing complaints will not run during this period. Properly filed complaints will be accepted and processed after the election results have been certified.

                  Sec. 4-27. - Transfer of license. 
                  (a)  No license for the sale of alcoholic beverages shall be transferable, except as otherwise provided herein. 
                  (b)  In case of the death of a licensee, the establishment shall be allowed to continue to sell alcoholic beverages for a period of 45 days from the date of death, or until expiration of the license, or until approval of a new licensee, whichever shall first occur, provided that no sale of alcoholic beverages shall be allowed until such time as a personal representative of the estate, appointed by a probate court of competent jurisdiction, shall make application for authorization with the city clerk. 
                  (c)  In the event that a license is surrendered, or a licensee severs such person's association with a licensed establishment, the establishment may continue to sell alcoholic beverages for a period of 45 days from the date of surrender, or from the date determined to be the date of severance, provided that no such sale shall be authorized until such time as a new application for a license is made, such application indicating that no change of ownership has occurred, except as excepted herein. Upon issuance of a new license, the authorization to sell under the previous license shall be revoked by operation of law. No additional license fees shall be required during the period for which the original license was issued. 
                  (d)  Nothing in this section, however, shall prohibit one or more of the partners in a partnership holding a license to withdraw from the partnership in favor of one or more of the partners who were partners at the time of the issuance of the license. This section shall not prohibit transfer of stock between persons who held stock in the corporate owner at the time of issuance of the license, nor shall it prohibit transfers of stock which do not result in any person increasing such person's stock holdings to a total of five percent or more of any class of stock. 
                  (e)  Should a transfer of location be approved, with no change of ownership of the business, the license fee paid for the old location shall be applied to the new location. 
                  (f)  Except as provided above, any change in the ownership of any entity owning a licensed establishment shall cancel and revoke any license issued hereunder automatically, without the necessity of any hearing. 
                  (g)  Violation of this section shall result in revocation of the license being used and a fine as provided in section 1-8. No license will be issued to the old or the new owner in the city for one year from the date of the violation.

The intent of this subsection is to prohibit sales of single beers, wine coolers or similar alcoholic beverages from open, cooled containers such as ice-filled buckets, tubs, or barrels and to prohibit such sales from other containers located within 20 feet of the front door and cash registers of the premises. 
                  (c)  Furnishing to, purchase of or possession by persons under the age of 21 years of alcoholic beverages shall be controlled by state law, O.C.G.A. § 3-3-23.

                  Except during the initial bottling by the manufacturer, it shall be unlawful for any licensee to add to the contents of a bottle or to refill empty bottles or in any other manner to misrepresent the quantity, quality or brand name of any alcoholic beverage.

                  (a)  All licensees must, within six months after the approval of the license, open for business the establishment referred to in the application and license, and begin the sale of the products authorized by the license. Failure to open the establishment and begin the sale as referred to above within the six-month period shall serve as automatic forfeiture and cancellation of the license, and no refund of the license fee shall be made to the license holder. 
                  (b)  Any licensee who shall, for a period of three consecutive months, cease to operate the business and sale of the products authorized in the license shall, after such three-month period, automatically forfeit the license, which license shall be cancelled without the necessity of any further action, and without refund of the license fee to the license holder. 
                  (c)  A license may be suspended or revoked by the city clerk where the licensee furnishes fraudulent or untruthful information in the application for a license or omits information required in the application for a license and for failure to pay any fees, taxes or other charges imposed under the provisions of this chapter. 
                  (d)  Whenever the state shall revoke any permit or license to sell alcoholic beverages, the city license shall thereupon be automatically revoked without any action by the city clerk or any municipal officer or body.

The chief of police, upon notice of this revocation, shall take the necessary steps to see that signs are removed and that all alcoholic beverage sales cease. 
                  (e)  The city clerk shall revoke the licenses of any licensee whose license has been suspended three or more times in any consecutive 12-month period. 
                  (f)  The city clerk shall revoke the license for any premises where alcoholic beverages have been sold or distributed during a period of suspension. 
                  (g)  The city clerk may suspend or revoke the license of any establishment which does not meet the licensing qualifications set forth in this chapter at any time such knowledge becomes known to such clerk. 
                  (h)  An act or omission of a licensee, owner of more than five percent interest in the licensed establishment, or employee of the licensee or licensed establishment willingly or knowingly performed, which constitutes a violation of federal or state law or of any provision of this chapter, will subject the licensee to suspension or revocation of the license in accordance with the provisions of this chapter when the city clerk determines to such clerk's own satisfaction that the act or omission did occur, regardless of whether any criminal prosecution or conviction ensues; provided, however, in the case of an employee, the city clerk must determine that the acts of the employee were known to or under reasonable circumstances should have been known to the licensee, were condoned by the licensee, or where the licensee has not established practices or procedures to prevent the violation from occurring.

Any applicant or licensee who is aggrieved or adversely affected by a final action of the city clerk may have a review thereof by appeal to the city council. Such appeal shall be by written petition, filed in the office of the city clerk within 15 days after the final order or action of the city clerk. 
                  (c)  Within ten days of the date of the decision, any applicant not granted a license may, in writing, request a hearing on the denial before the city council. The council shall set down the hearing for the next regular council session, unless the next regular meeting of council is less than ten days prior to the meeting; in that event, the hearing shall be held on the next regular council meeting following, unless a continuance of such date is agreed to by the appellant and the city clerk. At the hearing, the appellant may respond to and challenge such decision, to present witnesses under oath, offer evidence, and cross examine opposing witnesses. The appellant at such hearing shall have the right to be represented by an attorney, at the expense of the appellant. 
                  (d)  The findings of the city council shall be forwarded to the city clerk after the conclusion of the hearing, and it shall be the duty of the city clerk to notify the appellant of the action of the city council.

                  (a)  Brown bagging of alcoholic beverages, including both distilled spirits and malt beverages, at any establishment in the city is hereby prohibited. Brown bagging by an individual shall constitute a misdemeanor and may be punished by a fine up to $100.00 per incident. 
                  (1)  An "establishment" is defined as any business operated for entertainment purposes, or any entity which sponsors entertainment events, where an admission fee is charged. The profit or nonprofit status of the underlying business shall have no bearing on its qualifying as an establishment under this section. 
                  (2)  "Brown bagging" is defined as the bringing of alcoholic beverages into an establishment by any patron regardless of whether a separate charge for the alcoholic beverage is assessed in addition to the admission fee.

                  (a)  Any person who acquires a license or a renewal thereof in violation of this chapter by any misrepresentation or fraudulent statement, or who, after acquiring a license, is found to have violated any of the provisions of this chapter, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine as set forth in this section, infra. Each day's continuance of a violation shall be considered a separate offense. 
                  (b)  Any untrue or misleading information contained in, or material omission left out of, an original, renewal, or transfer application for a license shall be cause for the denial thereof and, if any license has been granted under these circumstances, these shall be cause for revocation. 
                  (c)  The city council may revoke or suspend a license or impose a fine against the licensee for any violation of this chapter. Such fine may be imposed by the city council in the maximum amount of $1,000.00 for the first violation, $1,000.00 for the second violation, and $1,000.00 for the third violation. Such revocation or suspension shall be for a maximum of 24 months, the period to be determined at the discretion of the council.

                  Sec. 8-3. - Duties of owners; appointment of public officer; procedures for determining premises to be unsafe or unhealthful. 
                  (a)  It is the duty of the owner of every dwelling, building, structure, or property within the jurisdiction to construct and maintain such dwelling, building, structure, or property in conformance with applicable codes in force within the city, or such ordinances which regulate and prohibit activities on property and which declare it to be a public nuisance to construct or maintain any dwelling, building, structure or property in violation of such codes or ordinances. It shall be unlawful for such owner to allow a dwelling, building, structure, or property within the jurisdiction to become unsafe, unsanitary, dangerous or detrimental to the health, safety, or welfare, or otherwise inimical to the welfare of the residents of the city or otherwise become a nuisance as set forth under this Code or the laws of the state. 
                  (b)  It is the further duty of the every owner and occupant of every dwelling, building, structure, or property within the jurisdiction to maintain safe and sanitary premises and not to create, maintain or allow the accumulation of weeds, brush, vegetation, trash, junk, debris, filth and other unsafe or unsanitary conditions on or in said dwelling, building, structure, or property.

                  (c)  The city council hereby appoints and designates the city code enforcement officer, or city manager when provided, as the public officers to exercise the powers prescribed by this chapter. 
                  (d)  (1)  Whenever a request is filed with the public officer by a public authority or by at least five residents of the city charging that any dwelling, building, or structure is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer shall make an investigation or inspection of the specific dwelling, building, structure, or property. 
                  (2)  If the officer's investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer may issue a complaint in rem against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building, or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general nuisance exists and shall cause summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the interested parties for such dwelling, building, or structure. 
                  (3)  The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; identify the interested parties; state with particularity the factual basis for the action; and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. The summons shall notify the interested parties that a hearing will be held before the municipal court of the city, at a date and time certain and at a place within the city where the property is located. Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days, nor more than 45 days, after the filing of said complaint in court. The interested parties shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for the hearing. 
                  (4)  The municipal court of the city shall have full jurisdiction to try and dispose of all such complaints. 
                  (e)  If after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state in writing findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order: 
                  (1)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of crimes; or 
                  (2)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property. 
                  For purposes of this section, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. The income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a state appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. title 41, ch. 39A (O.C.G.A. § 41-39A-1 et seq.), qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction. 
                  (f)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, improved, to be vacated and closed, or demolished. Such abatement action by the city shall commence within 270 days after the expiration of time specified in the court order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action must commence. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (g)  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any monies received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and the city are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
                  (h)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the municipal tax collector or city revenue officer, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
                  (i)  The public officers designated herein may issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted by ordinance, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and may seek to enforce such citation in any court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this section.

In addition to any other remedies provided by law, any person, contractor or company commencing any work on a building or structure, mechanical, gas, plumbing, or electrical system before obtaining the required permit shall be subject to a penalty of 100 percent of the usual permit fee in addition to the required permit fee. 
                  (d)  Work exempt from permit. Exemptions from the permit requirements of this section shall not be deemed to grant authorization for any work to be done in any manner in violation of the provisions of this chapter or any other laws or ordinances of the city. 
                  (e)  Application for permit. 
                  (1)  To obtain a permit, the applicant shall first file an application therefor in writing on a form furnished by the administration department for that purpose. Such application shall: 
                  a.  Identify and describe the work to be covered by the permit for which application is made. 
                  b.  Describe the land on which the proposed work is to be done by street address, legal description or similar description that will readily identify and definitely locate the proposed building or structure or work. 
                  c.  Indicate the use and occupancy for which the proposed work is intended. 
                  d.  Be accompanied by construction plans and documents and any other information that the building official may require to ascertain whether the proposed building meets the requirements of this chapter. 
                  e.  State the valuation of the proposed work. 
                  f.  Contain the full names, addresses and telephone numbers of the applicant/contractor and the property owner and shall be signed by the applicant/contractor and the property owner. 
                  (2)  The code enforcement officer may require any additional information to be provided so that an understanding of all work to be performed can be ascertained from the permit application. 
                  (f)  Action on application. The code enforcement officer shall examine or cause to be examined all applications for permits and amendments thereto within a reasonable time after filing but no later than 60 calendar days after the filing of a complete application in conformity with this section. If the application or the construction plans or documents do not conform to the requirements of this chapter, the code enforcement officer shall reject such application in writing, stating the reasons therefor. If the code enforcement officer is satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the requirements of this chapter, the code enforcement officer shall issue a permit therefor as soon as practicable. 
                  (g)  Validity of permit. The issuance or granting of a permit shall not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of, any violation of any provisions of this chapter, of any local, state or federal law or any provision of this Code. Permits presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this chapter or other provisions of this Code shall not be valid and are void. The issuance of a permit based on construction plans and documents and other data shall not prevent the code enforcement officer from requiring the correction of errors in the construction plans and documents and other data. The code enforcement officer is also authorized to prevent occupancy or use of a building or structure where there exists any violation of this chapter or of any other provisions of this Code, or where there exists a hazard to the health, safety and welfare of the public or the occupants of the building or structure. 
                  (h)  Expiration of permit. Every permit issued shall become invalid and of no force and effect if the work on the site authorized by such permit is not commenced or if no city inspection has been performed within six months after its issuance, or if the work authorized on the site by such permit has been commenced and has been suspended or abandoned or no further city inspection has been performed for a period of 180 days. The code enforcement officer is authorized to grant one written extension of the permit for a period of not more than 180 days. The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated. 
                  (i)  Suspension or revocation. The code enforcement officer is authorized to suspend or revoke a permit issued under the provisions of this chapter if the permit is issued in error or on the basis of incorrect, inaccurate or incomplete information, or in violation of any applicable provision of this Code. 
                  (j)  Contractor change, reissuing of permit. 
                  (1)  No permit shall be reissued on any work or job site for which a permit already exists except after notification in writing from the owner of the change in contractor and that the new contractor is authorized by the owner to re-permit the work. Reissuance of a permit shall make the new contractor responsible for the complete job or system and all work or code deficiencies, if any, as built, erected or installed by the previous or former contractor. 
                  (2)  The contractor who re-permits the work or job shall pay a re-permit fee in the amount established by action of the city council. 
                  (k)  Placement of building permit and construction plans. The building permit, or copy, and construction plans shall be kept on the site of the work until completion of the work.

                  Sec. 8-89. - Construction plans and documents. 
                  (a)  Submittal of plans and documents. Construction plans and documents, special inspection and structural observation programs, and other data shall be submitted in one or more sets with each application for a permit. The construction plans and documents shall be prepared by a registered design professional. When the code enforcement officer is unable to make a determination as to the grant or denial of a permit based upon the plans submitted with a permit application, the code enforcement officer is authorized to require additional construction plans and documents to be prepared by the applicant or a registered design professional. 
                  (b)  Waiver by code enforcement officer. The code enforcement officer is authorized to waive in writing the submission of construction plans and documents and other data required to be prepared by a registered design professional if it is found that the nature of the work applied for is such that reviewing of construction plans and documents is not necessary to obtain compliance with this chapter. In addition, construction plans and documents for single-family residential construction do not have to be prepared by a registered design professional unless required by the code enforcement officer in writing. 
                  (c)  Information on construction plans and documents. Construction plans and documents shall be dimensioned and drawn upon suitable material. Electronic media construction plans and documents are permitted to be submitted when approved by the code enforcement officer. Construction plans and documents shall be of sufficient clarity to indicate the location, nature and extent of the work proposed and show in detail that it will conform to the provisions of this Code and all other applicable laws and regulations. 
                  (d)  Fire protection system shop drawings. Shop drawings for the fire protection systems shall be submitted to indicate conformance with this chapter and the construction plans and documents and shall be approved by the code enforcement officer prior to the start of system installation. 
                  (e)  Manufacturer's installation instructions for installation. Manufacturer's installation instructions, as required by the international codes, shall be available on the job site at the time of inspection. 
                  (f)  Site plan. The construction plans and documents submitted with the application for a building permit shall be accompanied by a site plan approved by the development department, showing to scale the size and location of new construction and existing structures on the site, distances from lot lines, the established street grades and the proposed finished grades. The site plan shall be drawn in accordance with an accurate boundary line survey. In the case of demolition, the site plan shall show the construction to be demolished and the location and size of existing structures and construction that are to remain on the site or lot. The code enforcement officer is authorized to waive or modify in writing the requirement for a site plan. 
                  (g)  Examination of construction plans and documents. The code enforcement officer shall examine or cause to be examined the accompanying construction plans and documents and shall ascertain by such examination whether the proposed construction indicated and described is in compliance with the requirements of this chapter and other pertinent provisions of this Code. 
                  (h)  Approval of construction plans and documents. When a permit is issued, the construction plans and documents shall be approved, in writing or by stamp, as being in compliance with this chapter. However, the approval of construction plans and documents and other data shall not prevent the code enforcement officer from requiring the correction of errors in the construction plans and documents and other data. One set of construction plans and documents so reviewed shall be retained by the code enforcement officer. The other set shall be returned to the applicant, shall be kept at the site of work and shall be open to inspection by the building official. 
                  (i)  Previous approvals. The enactment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall not require changes in the construction plans and documents, construction or designated occupancy of a structure for which a lawful permit has been issued prior to enactment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived and the construction of which has been pursued and not abandoned within 180 days after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. 
                  (j)  Phased approval. The code enforcement officer is authorized to issue a permit for the construction of foundations or any other part of a building or structure before the construction plans and documents for the whole building or structure have been submitted, provided that construction plans and documents and adequate information and detailed statements have been filed complying with pertinent requirements of this chapter. The holder of such permit for the foundation or other parts of a building or structure shall proceed at the holder's own risk with the approved part of the building construction operation and without any assurance that a permit for the entire structure will be granted in the future.

                  (a)  Payment of fees. A permit shall not be valid until the fees prescribed by the city council have been paid. No amendment to a permit shall be released to the applicant until the additional permit fee, if any, has been paid. 
                  (b)  Schedule of permit fees. Permit fees for buildings, structures, mechanical, gas, plumbing and electrical systems shall be determined by the city council.

                  (2)  Scope. The certificate of occupancy certifies that all final inspections have been completed and the structure has been erected, to the best of the inspector's knowledge, in compliance with applicable Code requirements at the time of the issuance of the certificate. However, issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall not excuse the builder, contractor, tenant, or property owner from liability for any violation of this Code or any other applicable laws. Occupancy shall be limited to the area or portion of a building or structure defined by the building permit for which the certificate of occupancy is issued. 
                  (c)  Temporary certificate of occupancy.

                  b.  Failure to complete any stage of construction and/or site improvements required by the code enforcement officer in a timely manner. 
                  c.  Unauthorized occupancy or use of any part or portion of the building or structure other than the area or portion for which a temporary certificate of occupancy has been granted. 
                  d.  Any other conditions that may affect the health, safety and welfare of persons or property.

                  (1)  Scope. A certificate of change of tenant shall be required whenever there is a change of tenant occupancy in any nonresidential building, structure or use and no construction, alterations, improvements or repairs to the building, structure, plumbing, mechanical, gas or electrical systems have been or are to be made.

                  (a)  Generally. Construction or work for which a permit is required shall be subject to inspection by the code enforcement officer and such construction or work shall remain accessible and exposed for inspection purposes until approved. Approval as a result of an inspection shall not be construed to be an approval of a violation of the provisions of this chapter or of other applicable provisions of this Code. Inspections presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this chapter or of other provisions of this Code shall not be valid. It shall be the duty of the permit applicant to cause the work to remain accessible and exposed for inspection purposes. Neither the code enforcement officer, nor the city, shall be liable for any expense entailed in the removal of any material required to allow inspection. 
                  (b)  Preliminary inspection. 
                  (1)  Before issuing a permit, the building official is authorized to examine buildings, structures and sites for which an application has been filed. 
                  (2)  When it is evident that the city cannot provide an inspection service of construction covered by this chapter within two business days of receiving a valid written request for an inspection, then, in lieu of an inspection by inspections personnel employed by the city, any person, firm, or corporation engaged in a construction project which requires an inspection shall have the option of retaining, at their own expense, an inspector, who is not an employee or otherwise affiliated with or financially interested in such person, firm, or corporation, to provide the required inspection. 
                  (c)  Inspections requests. It shall be the duty of the holder of the permit or their duly authorized agent to notify the code enforcement officer when work is ready for inspection. It shall be the duty of the permit holder to provide safe access to and a safe means for inspection of such work for any inspections that are required by this chapter. 
                  (d)  Approval required. Work shall not be done beyond the point indicated in each successive inspection without first obtaining the approval of the code enforcement officer. The code enforcement officer, upon notification, shall make the requested inspections and shall either indicate the portion of the construction that is satisfactory as completed or shall notify the permit holder or an agent of the permit holder wherein the same fails to comply with this Code. Any portions that do not comply shall be corrected and such portion shall not be covered or concealed until authorized by the code enforcement officer. 
                  (e)  Right-of-entry. Inspections required under the provisions of this chapter shall be made by the building official or designee. Upon presentation of proper credentials, the building official or designee may enter the premises between 8:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. to perform any duty imposed by this chapter, provided that the building official or designee has consent to enter the premises or has obtained and presents an inspection warrant as described in this chapter.

As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs.

                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;

                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in subsections (c)(16) and (17) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of article 5, chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (17)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with chapter 5 of title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970," and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade stormwater detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. O-020-16, § IV, 4-14-2016; Ord. No. O-030-17, § IV, 12-14-2017) 
                  Sec. 12-23. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of McRae-Helena without first obtaining a permit from the City of McRae-Helena to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the City of McRae-Helena and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 12-22(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 12-22(c)(15), (16) and (17) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 12-22(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 12-22(c)(15), (16) and (17) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1).

                  (a)  The City of McRae-Helena will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)  The City of McRae-Helena shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  (a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  (b)  Stop-work orders. 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and; 
                  (3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  (4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 12-23(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. 
                  (1)  Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any city charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article under county ordinances approved under this article shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

                  When used in this article the following words and phrases shall have meanings given in this section. 
                  Hazardous waste means any solid waste which has been defined as a hazardous waste in regulations promulgated by the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) pursuant to the federal act, which are in force and effect on February 1, 1988, codified as 40 C.F.R. sections 260 and 261, and as amended by the Georgia Environmental Protection Division Rules for Hazardous Waste Management (chapter 391-3-11). 
                  Lot means the contiguous land in the same ownership which is not divided by any public highway or alley, including any part thereof subject to any easement for any purpose other than a public highway or alley, but excluding any part thereof severed from another lot where the severance creates any nonconformity of size or use. 
                  Perennial river/stream means a river/stream or section of a river/stream that has normal stream flow consisting of base flow or both base flow and direct runoff during any period of the year. 
                  Protected river corridor means all land, inclusive of islands, in areas of a protected river within a distance of 100 feet horizontally on both sides of the river measured from the uppermost part of the river bank, as existing at the time of the application of this article; the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the water is included in the protected area. 
                  River/stream bank means the rising ground, bordering a river or a stream, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow. 
                  Subdivision means all divisions of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots, building sites, or other divisions for the purpose of sale, legacy, or building development, whether immediate or future. This shall include all divisions or re-subdivisions of land involving a new road or change in existing roads. Excluded from this definition is the combination or recombination of portions of previously platted lots where the total number of lots is not increased. 
                  Utility means public or private water or sewer piping systems, water or sewer pumping stations, electric power lines, fuel pipelines, telephone lines, fiber optic lines, roads, driveways, bridges, river/lake access facilities, stormwater systems and railroads or other utilities identified by a local government. 
                  Wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas, including wetlands created for mitigation purposes under section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrological vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation. 
                  (Ord. No. O-031-18, § 3, 5-10-2018) 
                  Sec. 12-54. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  Permit required. No building, mobile home, structure, or land within the jurisdiction of the City of McRae-Helena shall hereafter be erected, constructed, located, moved, used, subdivided, altered or disturbed except in conformity with the regulations herein and without first obtaining a permit from the City of McRae-Helena. This provision does and shall apply to the location of all manufactured housing and industrialized buildings in the city. 
                  (b)  Minimum lot size. All lots intended for residential or other use within the city shall be of such size as necessary to meet all requirements, rules, and regulations of the Georgia Department of Public Health according to the "Rules of Georgia Department of Public Health for On-Site Sewage Management Systems" Manual for On-site Sewage Management Systems; and as necessary to comply with the minimums set forth in the tables MT-1 and MT-2 hereby attached to and made a part of this article as appendix 1, if on-site sewage management is utilized, and/or the local county board of health determination under the Manual; and/or this or other local ordinance, whichever is stricter (requires the largest lot size). 
                  (c)  On-site sewage management permit required. No person or business shall construct an on-site sewage management system on any lot within the city until site approval and an on-site sewage management construction permit has been obtained from and issued by the Telfair County Health Department. 
                  (d)  Permit coordination. The required permit under subsection (a) of this section shall not be issued until the Telfair County Health Department issues an on-site site sewage management construction permit or a site approval letter, whichever is appropriate, so that all lots proposed to be used or subdivided would satisfy the requirements of this article, including the "Rules of Georgia Department of Public Health for On-Site Sewage Management Systems." If the Telfair County Health Department is delegated the responsibility for administering this article, the permit or letter under this subsection (d) shall suffice as the permit required under subsection (a). 
                  (e)  Requirements are minimum. The regulations and requirements set by this article shall be the minimum requirements. 
                  (f)  Compliance with state and federal regulations. All developments, structures, and uses within the city shall also meet the requirements of all other local, federal and state regulations in effect, including but not limited to, department of transportation regulations, state fire marshal regulations, Georgia's Uniform Construction Codes, Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act permits, and all other Georgia Department of Natural Resources and Georgia Environmental Protection Division environmental rules and regulations. Issuance of a permit under this article does not constitute certification of compliance with such codes or regulations, and does not abrogate responsibility of the owner to so comply. 
                  (g)  Map interpretation. If there is any uncertainty as to whether a lot, portion of lot, or a proposed construction or location impacts an environmental resource regulated by this article because of interpretation of the applicable map, the decision of the City of McRae-Helena, or the Telfair County Health Department if it is delegated the responsibility for administering this article shall take precedent and be considered correct and final, but may be appealed as set forth in subsection (h). 
                  (h)  Map appeal. Any person who feels aggrieved by a decision of the City of McRae-Helena or the Telfair County Health Department, as appropriate, regarding map interpretation may at their own expense request reconsideration. Such reconsideration shall include submission of scientific evidence for reversal of the alleged error in map interpretation, and such evidence must be documented by a state registered engineer, geologist, or soils scientist. To obtain a reversal of the decision of map interpretation, the evidence must be acceptable to Georgia Department of Natural Resources' Environmental Protection Division, and the City of McRae-Helena, and/or the Telfair County Health Department if the Telfair County Health Department is delegated responsibility for administering this article. Any costs for submission of evidence to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources' Environmental Protection Division shall be borne by the person requesting reconsideration. 
                  (i)  Coordination with zoning and other regulation. This article shall be coordinated with any zoning or other regulations adopted by the City of McRae-Helena, and if there is any conflict with those zoning or other regulations, the stricter provisions shall apply. If zoning is or has been adopted, the provisions of this article shall be considered an overlay, or additional requirement(s) to the requirements of underlying zoning regulations and district. 
                  (j)  Fees. Any fees for applications, inspections, and the issuance of permits or certificates required or issued under the provisions of this article shall be paid by the person seeking such permit at the time of application in advance of the issuance of such permits or certificates. 
                  The amount of such fees, if any, shall be those established by the City of McRae-Helena from time to time. 
                  (Ord. No. O-031-18, § 4, 5-10-2018) 
                  Sec. 12-55. - Delegation of ordinance administration. 
                  The City of McRae-Helena, because of the need for coordination, the city manager or her designee shall be charged with responsibility for administering this ordinance [from which this article derives] and ensuring compliance with its provisions. 
                  (Ord. No. O-031-18, § 5, 5-10-2018) 
                  Sec. 12-56. - Wetlands protection regulations. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. The wetlands within the City of McRae-Helena are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; open space; and recreational opportunities. 
                  (b)  Reference map. The official maps to be used as the determinant for location of wetlands in the City of McRae-Helena and to be regulated areas under this article will be the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Wetlands Inventory Maps for Telfair County. These maps portray generalized wetlands inventory areas, and these wetlands inventory areas do not necessarily represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands under the authority of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and cannot serve as a substitute for a jurisdictional wetland determination or a wetland delineation by that agency. 
                  (c)  Wetlands development permit requirements. No activity or use except those identified in subsection (d) shall be allowed within wetlands without a permit issued under this article. Activities or uses permitted under section 404 of the U.S. Clean Water Act may receive a local permit once any required federal permit, or if appropriate, letter of permission/determination, is obtained as described below, and any other applicable provisions of this article have been satisfied. 
                  (1)  If there is a determination in the administration of this article that a proposed activity, use, or development subject to permit herein would not be located in or near an identified wetlands inventory area and would not disturb an identified wetlands inventory area, no further action concerning this particular article section is necessary. 
                  (2)  If there is a determination in the administration of this article that a proposed activity, use, or development subject to permit herein may be located in or near an identified wetlands inventory area and might disturb wetlands which appear to be under the jurisdiction of section 404 of the U.S. Clean Water Act, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' jurisdictional wetlands determination shall be required prior to issuance of a permit under this article. 
                  (3)  If a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' jurisdictional wetlands determination is required, no local permit under this article will be issued until the person requesting the permit, at their own expense, obtains either a section 404 permit, if so required, or a letter of permission/determination from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that no federal permit is required. 
                  (4)  No action in the administration of this article, or no local permit issued pursuant to this article, relieves the landowner from any federal or state permitting requirements, including those relating to wetlands or land disturbance. 
                  (d)  Permitted uses not requiring a permit. The following uses are permitted without permit within the wetlands of the city to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein, and provided they have no long term impairment for wetland function. 
                  (1)  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission. (Section 404 does not require permits for normal, ongoing silvicultural activities. However, section 404 does list some required road construction best management practices that must be followed in order to qualify for such an exemption.). 
                  (2)  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, or other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of the State of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require a section 404 permit. 
                  (3)  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, hunting, bird watching, hiking, biking, boating, horseback riding, kayaking, and canoeing. 
                  (4)  Natural water quality treatment or purification. 
                  (5)  Normal agriculture activities, including the planting and harvesting of crops and pasturing of livestock. Such activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture. 
                  (e)  Prohibited uses. In compliance with the Georgia "Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria," the following uses are prohibited entirely and no permit shall be issued for them. 
                  (1)  Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants. 
                  (2)  Hazardous or sanitary waste landfills. 
                  (Ord. No. O-031-18, § 6, 5-10-2018) 
                  Sec. 12-57. - Groundwater recharge areas protection regulations. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides and herbicides sprayed on crops and animal waste, like septic tank affluents, contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies. 
                  (b)  Reference map. The official map for delineation of significant groundwater recharge areas in the City of McRae-Helena to be regulated areas under this article is the Georgia Department of Natural Resources' "Significant Recharge Areas, Hydrological Atlas 18 (1989 edition)." 
                  (c)  Groundwater recharge areas development permit requirements. All uses except those identified in subsection (d) and those subject to further restriction by any underlying zoning district are allowed. The following are additional requirements for specific uses: 
                  (1)  All new above ground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660 gallons, shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks, and shall otherwise meet the requirements of U.S. EPA rules for oil pollution prevention, 40 CFR 112.1 and following. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt, provided they comply with all federal and state requirements. 
                  (2)  All single-family dwellings, multi-family dwellings, mobile home parks, or other uses located within a groundwater recharge area and not served by both public water and sewer systems shall be required to have 150 percent of the minimum lot or space size calculated based on application of the Georgia Department of Public Health Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (DPH Manual) Tables MT-1 and MT-2 (included as part of this article in appendix 1), as determined by the Telfair County Health Department. The minimums set forth in Tables MT-1 and MT-2 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in sections A—F) of the Public Health Manual. Said minimum lot size shall not be in any case less than the minimum lot size specified by any underlying zoning district. The regulations or determination specifying the largest minimum lot size shall apply. 
                  (3)  All lots shall have a minimum width of 150 feet, or as specified in any underlying zoning district if stricter (larger), in the area where an approved on-site sewage management system is to be located. 
                  (4)  No construction may proceed on a building or mobile home to be served by a septic tank or other on-site sewage management system unless the Telfair County Health Department first approves the proposed on-site sewage management system installation as meeting the requirements of the Georgia Department of Public Health Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems and the provisions of this article. 
                  (5)  All new wastewater treatment basins shall have an impermeable liner except for the construction of mining settling basins. 
                  (6)  All new agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined. As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compact clay having a thickness of one-foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 × 10 -7 cm/sec or other criteria established by the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service, or Georgia's Environmental Protection Division. 
                  (d)  Prohibited uses. The following uses are prohibited entirely and no permit shall be issued for them. 
                  (1)  All new hazardous waste storage, treatment and disposal facilities. 
                  (2)  New facilities handling hazardous materials regulated by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources as to require a permit. 
                  (3)  Permanent stormwater infiltration basins. 
                  (4)  All new sanitary or other landfills. 
                  (Ord. No. O-031-18, § 7, 5-10-2018) 
                  Sec. 12-58. - Major river corridor protection district regulations. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. Perennial river or water courses with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second are of vital importance to Georgia in that they help preserve those qualities that make a river suitable for habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source for clean drinking water. These river corridors also allow the free movement of wildlife from area to area within the state, help control erosion and river sedimentation, and help absorb floodwaters. 
                  (b)  District delineation. Protected rivers as defined under the Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria, adopted by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, includes any perennial river or water courses with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second. The Ocmulgee River through Telfair County meets this criteria. A protected river corridor and a protective 100-foot natural vegetative buffer, as defined in Georgia Rule 391-3-16, is hereby established along the entire length of this river(s) within the jurisdiction of Telfair County. The buffer area is measured horizontally from each river bank, if any, within the city jurisdiction. Under the method prescribed by the Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria, no development or other land-disturbing activity will be allowed to occur within the protected river corridor and within a 100-foot buffer of the river bank except for the following permitted uses. 
                  (c)  Permitted uses. No development, or construction, or other land disturbing activity will be allowed to occur within the 100-foot buffer from the protected river except for the following uses, as long as they do not impair the longterm functions of the protected river or the protected river corridor. In addition, the natural vegetative buffer shall be restored as quickly as possible following any land-disturbing activity or construction permitted within the river corridor for these acceptable uses. 
                  (1)  Single-family dwellings, if any underlying zoning district so permits, provided each dwelling is located on a lot with a minimum size as specified by the Telfair County Health Department or the underlying zoning district regulations, but shall be the greater of these requirements; however, in any case the lot for each dwelling shall not be less than two acres, not including any area between the river banks; and provided the septic tank drainfield is located outside of the 100-foot buffer area. 
                  (2)  Any residential uses existing or under construction prior to the adoption of these local protection ordinances provided the use has an on-site sewage management construction permit issued by the Telfair County Health Department prior to the date of adoption of these local protection ordinances. 
                  (3)  Any industrial or commercial uses existing prior to the adoption of these local protection ordinances, providing they do not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the federal Clean Water Act, as amended, and meet all other federal and state environmental rules and regulations. 
                  (4)  Road and utility crossings, and utility locations if no other location is reasonable, providing the construction of these crossings and uses meet the requirements of the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, as amended, or any other state or local requirements, if stricter, protect the integrity of the buffer area to the extent reasonably possible, and are located as far from the river bank as is reasonably possible. 
                  (5)  Timber production and harvesting, providing it is consistent with the best management practices established by the Georgia Forestry Commission, and does not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the federal Clean Water Act, as amended. 
                  (6)  Agricultural production and management, provided it is consistent with the best management practices established by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission or its successor, and all other state and federal laws and regulations, including those promulgated by the Georgia Department of Agriculture; and does not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the federal Clean Water Act, as amended. 
                  (7)  Wildlife and fisheries management activities consistent with the purposes of O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 (as amended). 
                  (8)  Natural water quality treatment or purification. 
                  (9)  Wastewater treatment. 
                  (10)  Recreational usage consistent with the maintenance of a natural vegetative buffer or with river dependent recreation. 
                  (d)  Prohibited USES. In compliance with the Georgia "Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria," the following uses are prohibited entirely and no permit shall be issued for them. 
                  (1)  Facilities or areas used for the handling, receiving, storing, or disposal of hazardous wastes. 
                  (2)  Hazardous or solid waste landfills. 
                  (3)  Septic tank drainfields within the 100-foot buffer area under any circumstance. 
                  (4)  Septic tanks within the 100-foot buffer area, except as expressly provided for single-family dwellings which are permitted under and comply with subsection (c)(1).

                  Sec. 12-59. - Variances. 
                  When due to a particular hardship or extraordinary circumstance of the property involved which is not easily corrected, it is impractical for an owner or developer to comply with all of the requirements of this article, the City of McRae-Helena shall be authorized to vary such requirements (under its jurisdiction) only to such extent as to provide fairness to the owner or developer and as to not violate the intent and purposes of this article. Such variances shall only be granted in an official public meeting, and the reasons for granting them shall be entered into the minutes of the public meeting.

So help me God." 
                  (f)  Term of office. The prosecuting attorney for the municipal court shall serve until otherwise designated by the mayor and council as authorized by O.C.G.A. § 15-18-91(c). It shall be at the discretion of the city council to appoint a prosecutor upon the vacancy of position.

At any time in which a substitute prosecuting attorney is not available or an appointment has not been made, the city attorney may serve as the substitute prosecuting attorney until such time as a prosecuting attorney or substitute prosecuting attorney is available or appointed.

                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

                  Designated truck route means a city street or portion of a city street, designated by the city herein in section 32-23, over which all lawful vehicles may move subject to compliance with the laws of the state. 
                  Exempted activity means the activity of trucks, specified herein in section 32-24 as being allowed, under limited circumstances, on residential streets. 
                  Residential streets means all city streets or portions of city streets which are located within residentially zoned areas of the city, as are shown by the most recent zoning map, as may be changed from time to time by zoning modifications, which map is on file at city hall, and which map is incorporated herein for all purposes. To the extent a street or portion of the street is abutted on both sides of the right-of-way by residentially zoned property, that street or portion thereof shall be deemed a residential street. At such point as, and to the extent that, a street or portion thereof is abutted on one or both rights-of-way by commercially or industrially zoned property, such street shall not be considered to be a residential street. For example, South 1st Avenue, south of Parsonage Street shall be deemed to be a residential street; north of Parsonage Street, such street shall not be considered to be a residential street. 
                  Truck means any bus, tractor/trailer, truck or other vehicle whose maximum gross weight exceeds 10,000 pounds. 
                  Zoning map means the map showing the city zoning which is current and in effect at the time the truck is present on the residential street. In the event of a zoning change in one or more areas of the city, however, there shall be allowed a 30-day grace period from the date of the zoning modification, during which warnings may be issued to drivers of trucks present in any area which has been newly zoned as residential. During the said 30-day period, no violations shall be prosecuted for trucks present in the areas which have been newly zoned as residential.

                  1.  All other applicable laws and regulations are complied with; 
                  2.  There are no changes in the nature or character of such non-conforming use;

                  Section 919: - Storage of Recreation Vehicle, Travel Trailer, or Camper. 
                  One (1) recreation vehicle, travel trailer, or camper, as defined in Article III Definition of Terms (58) of this Ordinance, may be stored on a residential lot provided it is located and unoccupied.

                  3.  Any building established as a part of a group development project which cannot properly be served by emergency or service vehicles from an abutting street shall be made accessible to such vehicles by a paved driveway having [a] roadbed width of not less than twenty (20) feet, exclusive of parking spaces. 
                  4.  Local streets which carry less than six hundred (600) vehicles per day may have access points as needed to fit the development. Connector streets and arterial streets which carry more than six hundred (600) vehicles per day shall have a minimum distance between access points equal to seven (7) times the speed limit for that street. 
                  5.  For all developments fronting on a state highway, no land use permit or sign permit shall be issued until the appraisal of the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) has been obtained regarding access points, curb radii, drainage and related engineering design of concern to the GDOT as well as the Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Council. 
                  Section 922: - Corner Lots.

Approval of a building or occupancy permit by the local government does not constitute certification of compliance with such codes or regulations, and does not abrogate responsibility of the owner to so comply. Where such codes exceed the minimum requirements of this Ordinance, the stricter provisions shall apply. 
                  Section 924: - Restriction on Location of Establishment. 
                  All licenses issued must be for retail alcoholic beverages, and the location of the places of business or outlets must lie within areas zoned commercial (C-1) on a planning and zoning map of the City of McRae-Helena, and in addition, no such places of business selling alcoholic beverages shall be issued a license to operate anywhere else within the City Limits of the City of McRae-Helena, except the following locations:

                  Section 925: - Conditional Use Permits. 
                  (1)  Purpose. The purpose of a conditional use permit (CUP) is to allow the establishment of uses which may be suitable only in certain locations in a zoning district or only when subject to standards and conditions that assure compatibility with adjoining uses. Conditional uses are those uses which are generally compatible with the permitted land uses in a given zoning district, but which require review of their proposed location, design and configuration, and the impositions of conditions in order to ensure the appropriateness of the use at a particular location within a given zoning district. Only those uses enumerated as conditional uses in a particular zoning district shall be authorized as conditional uses. The CUP application must be accompanied by a site plan or building floor plan as deemed appropriate by the Code Enforcement Officer, City Manager, or other appropriate City Official. Site plans must be drawn to scale depicting how the proposed conditional use will conform to all space limits, buffers, parking and loading/offloading provisions, and other provisions outlined in the Zoning Ordinance of the City Of McRae-Helena. Upon issuing a conditional use permit, City Council may choose to attach permit to a tax parcel, individual commercial suite or unit, or corporate entity, without successors. A CUP is nontransferable to another location. 
                  (2)  Application process. 
                  (A)  Submittal of the application for a CUP. The property owner or designated applicant requesting a conditional use permit may apply for same with the Code Enforcement Officer and/or City Manager on a form designated by aforementioned and shall submit the completed application along with [the] application fee to the McRae-Helena City Hall. 
                  (B)  Additional information in addition to the CUP permit may be requested by the City Official handling the permitting process. 
                  (i)  Survey plat of subject property, prepared within the last ten (10) years by a professional engineer, landscape architect or land surveyor registered in the state of Georgia. Survey plat shall indicate the complete boundaries of the subject property and all buildings existing thereon; include a notation as to whether or not any portion of the subject property is within the boundaries of the 100 year flood plain; include a notation as to the total acreage or square footage of the subject property; 
                  (ii)  Name, mailing address, e-mail address and phone number of all owners of the property which is subject to the application; 
                  (iii)  Signed and notarized affidavit of all owners of the subject property authorizing the filing of the application for the conditional use permit and, where applicable, the signed and notarized affidavit of the owner of the subject property authorizing an applicant or agent to act on their behalf in the filing of the application for the conditional use permit. The application shall also contain a mailing address, an e-mail address, and phone number of any applicant who is authorized to represent the owner of the subject property; 
                  (iv)  Written legal description of the property; 
                  (v)  The existing use, proposed conditional use and the zoning district in which the property is located; 
                  (vi)  A statement of the relationship and general compatibility of the proposed use to adjacent land use in terms of traffic, parking and noise and other nuisances; 
                  (vii)  Statement of current zoning classification of property and the proposed use of the property; 
                  (viii)  A written, documented analysis of the impact of the proposed conditional use permit with respect to all criteria contained in this ordinance; 
                  (ix)  A statement of the relationship and general compatibility of the proposed use to adjacent land use in terms of traffic, parking and noise and other nuisances; and 
                  (x)  Complete and detailed site plan of the proposed use prepared, signed, and sealed by an architect, landscape architect, engineer or contractor licensed in the state. The City shall reserve the right to request additional information according to the scope of the project. The plan shall show the following: 
                  (a)  All buildings and structures constructed and their location on the property; 
                  (b)  Height of proposed buildings; 
                  (c)  Proposed use of each building; 
                  (d)  All driveways, parking areas and loading/unloading areas; 
                  (e)  Location of all trash and garbage disposal materials;

                  (3)  Staff analysis. The Code Enforcement Officer or his/her designee shall conduct a site inspection and shall prepare an analysis of each application for conditional use permit and shall present his/her findings and recommendations in written form to the Planning and Zoning Commission (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Commission"). No application shall be amended later than the deadline for advertising the requisite hearing before the Commission. 
                  (4)  Notification of public hearing and posting of signs on property for zoning notification. Staff will notify the applicant of the date of the next available Commission meeting in accordance with those procedures established in Section 1404. As required by ordinance, the applicant will be responsible for the cost of posting the zoning notification signs on the property for which the conditional use permit has been requested prior to the public hearing in accordance with the Georgia Zoning Procedure Law. 
                  (5)  Public hearing. A public hearing before the Commission is required for a conditional use permit application. The Policies and Procedures to be followed in the hearing have been adopted by Resolution R-066-17 and shall be made available at all Commission hearings. The Commission shall grant or deny the conditional use permit following the public hearing and after considering the criteria listed in the Standards Governing the Exercise of Zoning Power as adopted by Resolution R-066-17. Its decision shall be accompanied by written findings of fact and impose such conditions as are reasonably necessary to secure the purpose and objectives of this chapter. The Commission may vote on the CUP immediately after the public hearing or may defer to the next Council meeting for decision; the decision must be made not later than forty-five (45) days from the date of the public hearing, unless otherwise agreed to by the applicant or their designee. 
                  (6)  Conditions. The Commission and City Council may require such modifications in the proposed use and attach such conditions to the CUP as they deem necessary to mitigate adverse effects of the proposed use and carry out the spirit and intent of the ordinance. Conditions and modifications may include, but are not limited to: limitation of building size or height, increased open space, limitations on impervious surfaces, enhanced loading and parking requirements, additional landscaping, curbing, sidewalk, vehicular access and parking improvements, placement or orientation of buildings and entryways, buffer yards, landscaping and screening, signage restrictions and design, maintenance of buildings and outdoor areas, and hours of operations. 
                  (7)  Right to appeal. Any party, including the administrative staff of the city, aggrieved or affected by the decision of the Planning Commission involving an application for a conditional use permit may appeal to City Council. The City Council shall follow the same procedures and standards as are applicable to hearings before the Commission and shall render a decision in the same manner and under the same conditions. 
                  (8)  Issuance of conditional use permit. Upon approval of the Commission or upon appeal and approval by City Council, the Code Enforcement Officer shall issue to the applicant a conditional use permit which includes any conditions imposed by the Commission and any modifications ordered by Council on appeal. Such permit shall become effective upon approval by the Commission or upon appeal and approval by Council. A conditional use permit shall authorize only one particular conditional use and such permit shall automatically expire if, for any reason, the conditional use shall not begin within two years after the permit is issued or shall cease for more than six months after the permit is issued. A conditional use permit shall be personal to the applicant and shall not run with the land, and shall expire upon a transfer of ownership. 
                  (9)  Successive applications. An application for a conditional use permit affecting all or a portion of the same property shall not be submitted more than once every twelve (12) months measured from the date of the final decision of Mayor and City Council. The City Council may, by majority vote, waive or reduce this twelve-month time interval in case of a previously approved CUP. However, if the application for a conditional use permit was denied by the Planning and Zoning Commission for a particular property, the time interval between the date of said denial and any subsequent application for the same or substantially similar conditional use permit affecting the same property shall be no less than twelve (12) months. 
                  (10)  Violations of findings of fact. Whenever a previously approved conditional use is in violation of any of the findings of fact or other imposed conditions, pursuant to Section 925(8), the Code Enforcement Officer shall give notice in the same manner as service of summons in civil cases, or by certified mail addressed to the owner of record of the premises at his or her last known address, or to the address to which tax bills are sent. The notice shall include reasons by which the Code Enforcement Officer finds the conditional use to be in violation, and a statement that the owner shall have 30 days to comply with the granted conditional use permit. 
                  (11)  Permit revocation. Upon failure of the owner to comply with the notice, the Code Enforcement Officer shall notify the City Council that the conditional use is in violation and itemize the reasons for revocation of the conditional use permit. The City Council shall continue or revoke the conditional use permit at its first regular meeting after the notice is received. 
                  (Ord. No. O-029-17, 9-14-2017) 
                  Editor's note— As Ord. No. O-029-17 purported to add a new section 925 and the existing section 925 did not appear to be a true statement of positive law, reading as follows, the existing section 925 has been transferred into this footnote.  Section 925: Spot Rezoning.  Per City Attorney, Laurel Straughan (01/13/2004), you cannot do "Spot Rezoning." You can only rezone to extend an adjoining Zoning District. The property in question must adjoin property that is zoned the same as the requested rezoning district. You cannot rezone an isolated parcel of property.

                  (1)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to apply certain protections to property owners whose property is properly zoned and used by a business operating with a valid conditional use permit or is classified as a legally nonconforming conditional use establishment. Without this section, when a business requiring a conditional use permit ceases to operate, the property owner is required to have any new business obtain a conditional use permit before operating a business with the same conditional use on said property or suite.

                  (iii)  The term "business operating with a valid conditional use permit" means any company, corporation, partnership or other business entity located in a commercial or residential zone of the City which meets all of the following conditions: 
                  i.  The business, if of a type commonly registered with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Georgia, must be currently registered with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Georgia must maintain on file with the City evidence of the type of business entity they are operating; and 
                  ii.  The business must have a valid and current occupational tax license issued by the City; and 
                  iii.  The business must have a valid and current conditional use permit issued by the City or fall under the exception granted by this section.

                  1.  Administrative Review. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirements, decision or determination made by the Building Inspector in the enforcement of this ordinance. 
                  2.  Variances. To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variances from the terms of the ordinances as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance will, in an individual case, result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, so the spirit of the ordinances shall be observed. Public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. The existence of a nonconforming use of neighboring land, buildings, or structures in the same or in other districts shall not constitute a reason for a variance.

                  a.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of size, shape or topography that are not applicable to other lands or structures in the same district. 
                  b.  A literal interpretation of the provisions of this ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties of the district in which the property is located. 
                  c.  Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the property of the applicant any special privileges that are denied to other properties of the district in which the applicant's property is located. 
                  d.  The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this ordinance and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or to the general welfare. 
                  e.  The special circumstances are not the result of the actions of the applicant. 
                  f.  The variance requested in [is] the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the land, building or structure. 
                  g.  The variance is not a request to permit a use of land, building, or structure which is not permitted by right in the district involved. 
                  The Commission shall have all powers, duties and responsibilities as set forth under this title, city ordinance or resolution, and Georgia law, including but not limited to, the power to consider applications for rezoning a particular district within the corporate limits of the City and the power to make recommendations to the City Council concerning rezoning requests and ordinance amendments. 
                  Except as otherwise authorized by law, all meetings of the Planning and Zoning Commission at which official action is taken shall be open to the public and all records of the Planning and Zoning Commission shall be public record. 
                  Section 1406: - Appeals from Decisions of the Planning and Zoning Commission. 
                  Any person, firm or corporation aggrieved by any decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission may appeal that decision, within fifteen (15) days of the date of the written decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission. Failure to properly appeal the written decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission within this time period shall terminate any proceedings in which the Planning and Zoning Commission has jurisdiction, and the decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission shall be final, with the exception of zoning matters, since the Commission merely recommends to the City Council its position in certain zoning requests. The City Council has exclusive jurisdiction to take all final actions relating to the recommendations of the Planning and Zoning Commission affecting zoning pursuant to this chapter, applying all standards and procedures promulgated pursuant to this Code and any regulations adopted hereunder.

                  1.  The Company shall pay into the treasury of the City (a) on or before the first day of March in each year following the granting of this franchise, a sum of money equal to four percent (4%) of the gross sales of electric energy to customers served under residential and commercial rate schedules (as prescribed by the Georgia Public Service Commission) within the corporate limits of the City during the preceding calendar year and four percent (4%) of the gross sales of electric energy to customers served under industrial rate schedules (as so prescribed) within the corporate limits of the City during the period beginning on the first day of the month following the granting of this franchise and ending on December 31 thereafter and (b) on or before the first day of March of each year thereafter during the term of this franchise, a sum of money equal to four percent (4%) of the gross sales of electric energy to customers served under residential, commercial, and industrial rate schedules (as so prescribed) within the corporate limits of the City during the preceding calendar year, on condition that in the event the City shall grant to any other entity the right to use and occupy the City's streets for like purposes, such use and occupancy shall be upon the same terms and conditions as those herein contained, including the payment provisions hereof. 
                  2.  The amount, if any, of any tax, fee, charge, or imposition of any kind required, demanded, or exacted by the City on any account, other than ad valorem taxes on property, shall operate to reduce to that extent the amount due from the percentage of gross sales provided for in paragraph 1 of this Section II. 
                  3.  The Company shall fully protect, indemnify, and save harmless the City from all damages to persons or property caused by the construction, maintenance, operation, or extension of the Company's Facilities, or conditions of streets, alleys, or public places resulting therefrom, for which the City would otherwise be liable. 
                  4.  The Company shall, in constructing, maintaining, operating, and extending the Company's Facilities, submit and be subject to all reasonable exercises of the police power by the City. Nothing contained herein, however, shall require the Company to surrender or limit its property rights created hereby without due process of law, including adequate compensation, for any other purpose at the instance of the City or for any purpose at the instance of any other entity, private or governmental. 
                  5.  For purposes of paragraph 6 of this Section II, the term "Distribution Facilities" means poles, lines, wires, cables, conductors, insulators, transformers, appliances, equipment, connections, and other apparatus installed by or on behalf of the Company (whether before or after the adoption of this ordinance) in the streets, alleys, or public places of the City for the purpose of distributing electricity within the present and future corporate limits of the City. Distribution Facilities do not include any of the following: (i) electric transmission lines with a design operating voltage of 46 kilovolts or greater (hereinafter referred to as "Transmission Lines"); (ii) poles, towers, frames, or other supporting structures for Transmission Lines (hereinafter referred to as "Transmission Structures"); (iii) Transmission Lines and related wires, cables, conductors, insulators, or other apparatus attached to Transmission Structures; (iv) lines, wires, cables, or conductors installed in concrete-encased ductwork; or (v) network underground facilities. 
                  6.  In the event that the City or any other entity acting on behalf of the City requests or demands that the Company relocate any Distribution Facilities from their then-current locations within the streets, alleys, and public places of the City in connection with a public project or improvement, then the Company shall relocate, at its expense, the Distribution Facilities affected by such project or improvement. The Company's obligations under this paragraph 6 shall apply without regard to whether the Company has acquired, or claims to have acquired, an easement or other property right with respect to such Distribution Facilities and shall not affect the amounts paid or to be paid to the City under the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Section II. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph 6, the Company shall not be obligated to relocate, at its expense, any of the following: (i) Distribution Facilities that are located on private property at the time relocation is requested or demanded; (ii) Distribution Facilities that are relocated in connection with sidewalk improvements (unless such sidewalk improvements are related to or associated with road widenings, the creation of new turn lanes, or the addition of acceleration/deceleration lanes); (iii) streetscape projects or other projects undertaken primarily for aesthetic purposes; or (iv) Distribution Facilities that are converted from an overhead configuration or installation to an underground configuration or installation. 
                  7.  The City and the Company recognize that both parties benefit from economic development within the City. Accordingly, when it is necessary to relocate any of the Company's Facilities (whether Distribution Facilities, Transmission Lines, Transmission Structures, or other facilities) within the City, the City and the Company shall work cooperatively to minimize costs, delays, and inconvenience to both parties while ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, the City and the Company shall communicate in a timely fashion to coordinate projects included in the City's five-year capital improvement plan, the City's short-term work program, or the City's annual budget in an effort to minimize relocation of the Company's Facilities. Such communication may include, but is not limited to, (i) both parties' participation in the Georgia Utilities Coordinating Council, Inc. (or any successor organization) or a local utilities coordinating council (or any successor organization) and (ii) both parties' use of the National Joint Utility Notification System (or any successor to such system mutually acceptable to both parties). 
                  8.  With regard to each streetscape project undertaken by or on behalf of the City, the City shall pay the Company in advance for the Company's estimated cost to relocate any of the Company's Facilities (whether Distribution Facilities, Transmission Lines, Transmission Structures, or other facilities) in connection with such project. For each streetscape project, the Company shall estimate in good faith the amount of incremental base revenue, if any, that the Company will realize as a result of new customer load or expansion of existing customer load attributable to such project; and such estimate shall be based on tariffs in effect at the time that construction of such project begins and shall not include fuel recovery charges, non-electric service billings, or taxes. If such estimate indicates that the Company will realize incremental base revenue, the Company shall do one of the following, whichever results in greater cost savings to the City: (i) reduce the City's advance payment to the Company for relocation costs by ten percent (10%); or (ii) where the City has developed a bona fide marketing plan within twelve (12) months after construction of such project begins, either refund the amount of the Company's incremental base revenue during such twelve-month period to the City or credit such amount against any future payment due from the City to the Company. The City and the Company acknowledge and agree that the amount of any refund or credit calculated pursuant to clause (ii) of the foregoing sentence of this paragraph 8 shall not exceed the amount of the City's advance payment to the Company for relocation costs associated with such project.
