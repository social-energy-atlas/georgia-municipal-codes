PREFACE
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACEThis Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Town of Mount Airy, Georgia.
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1947 Code, as supplemented through June 29, 1991, and
ordinances subsequently adopted by the town council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in
parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time
with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any
section of the 1947 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein.
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter
have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law
have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of
this Code.
Chapter and Section Numbering System
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government
codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number,
and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is
numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the
same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new
material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section
would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be
placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article
embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included
by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained
when including new chapters.
Page Numbering System
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which
represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that
portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of
an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are
typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some
of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local
government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves that stand as guideposts
to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested.
Looseleaf Supplements
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this
system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page
or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the
manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are
received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached
instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid
misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.
Acknowledgments
This publication was under the direct supervision of Sandra S. Fox, Code Attorney, and K. Barrington, Editor, of the Municipal

                  Sec. 1-4. - Eect of repeal or expiration of Code section.
                  The repeal of a Code section or ordinance, or its expiration by virtue of any provision contained therein, shall not
                  affect any right accrued or any offense committed, any penalty or punishment incurred, or any proceeding
                  commenced before the repeal took effect or the ordinance expired.
                  When any ordinance repealing a former Code section, ordinance, clause or provision, shall be itself repealed, such
                  repeal shall not be construed to revive such former Code section, ordinance, clause, or provision, unless it shall be
                  expressly so provided.
                  Sec. 1-5. - Supplementation of Code.
                  By contract or by town personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or
                  directed by the town council. A supplement to the code shall include all substantive, permanent and general parts of
                  ordinances passed by the town council or adopted by initiative and referendum during the period covered by the
                  supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they
                  will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages that have become obsolete or partially
                  obsolete. The new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the code will be current through
                  the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. Charter amendments may be included
                  in like manner.
                  In the preparation of a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code that have been repealed shall be excluded
                  from the code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages.
                  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to
                  prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included
                  in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier
                  may:
                  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions;
                  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the code printed in
                  the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles;
                  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the code and, where
                  necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers;
                  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this
                  division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ through ____________" (inserting section numbers
                  to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into
                  the Code); and
                  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted
                  into the Code;

                  (d)
                  but, in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the
                  supplement or already embodied in the Code.
                  Sec. 1-6. - Amendments to Code.
                  All ordinances passed subsequent to this Code that amend, repeal or in any way affect this Code may be numbered
                  in accordance with the numbering system of this Code and printed for inclusion therein. When subsequent
                  ordinances repeal any chapter, section or subsection or any portion thereof, such repealed portions may be
                  excluded from said Code by omission from reprinted pages. The subsequent ordinances as numbered and printed,
                  or omitted in the case of repeal, shall be prima facie evidence of such subsequent ordinances until such time as this
                  Code and subsequent ordinances numbered or omitted are readopted as a new Code by the town council.
                  Amendments to any of the provisions of this Code shall be made by amending such provisions by specific reference
                  to the section number of this Code in the following language: "That section ____________ of The Code of Ordinances
                  of Mount Airy, Georgia, is hereby amended to read as follows: "____________." The new provisions shall then be set
                  out in full as desired.
                  In the event a new section not heretofore existing in the Code is to be added, the following language shall be used:
                  "That The Code of Ordinances of Mount Airy, Georgia, is hereby amended by adding a section, to be numbered
                  ____________, which said section reads as follows: "____________."The new section shall then be set out in full as
                  desired.
                  All sections, articles, chapters or provisions to be repealed must be specifically repealed by section, article or
                  chapter number, with reference to the subject matter, as the case may be.
                  Sec. 1-7. - Altering Code.
                  It shall be unlawful for any person to change or amend by additions or deletions any part or portion of this Code, or to insert
                  or delete pages or portions thereof, or to altar or tamper with such Code in any manner whatsoever, except by ordinance or
                  resolution or other official act of the town council.

                  authenticated, published and recorded in the book of ordinances, but shall not be prepared for insertion in this Code, nor be
                  deemed a part hereof.

                  A copy of this Code shall be kept on file in the office of the town clerk, preserved in loose-leaf form, or in such other form as
                  the clerk may consider most expedient. It shall be the express duty of the clerk or his designee to insert in their designated places
                  all resolutions, general resolutions and ordinances that indicate the intention of the town council to make the same a part of this
                  Code, when the same have been printed or reprinted in page form, and to extract from this Code all provisions that may be from
                  time to time repealed by the town council. A copy of this code shall be available in the office of the town clerk for examination by

                  insertion of amendatory pages as received. Each such copy shall remain the property of the town and shall be turned over by the
                  official or employee having custody thereof, upon expiration of his term of office or employment, to his successor or to the town
                  clerk, in case he shall have no successor.
                  Sec. 1-11. - General penalty; continuing violations, violations as public nuisance.
                  In this section, the phrase "violation of this Code" means:
                  Doing an act that is prohibited or made or declared to be an unlawful act, an offense, or a misdemeanor by
                  ordinance or by rule or regulation authorized by ordinance;
                  Failure to perform an act that is required to be performed by ordinance, rule, or regulation authorized by
                  ordinance; or
                  Failure to perform an act if the failure is declared a misdemeanor, an offense, or an unlawful omission by
                  ordinance, rule, or regulation authorized by ordinance.
                  The phrase "violation of this Code" does not include the failure of a town officer or town employee to perform an
                  official duty, unless it is provided that failure to perform the duty is to be punished as provided in this section or it is
                  clear from the context of this Code that it is the intent of the town to impose the penalty provided for in this section
                  upon the town officer or employee.
                  Except as otherwise provided in this Code or by general law, a person convicted of a violation of this Code shall be
                  punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000.00, imprisonment for a term not exceeding 90 days or work on the streets
                  or public works for a period not exceeding 90 days, or both, or any combination thereof.
                  All sentences must be in the alternative, and fines may be imposed with the alternative of the other punishment in
                  the event the fines are not paid. Each day any violation of any provision of this Code or any such ordinance,
                  resolution, rule, regulation or order shall continue shall constitute a separate offense.
                  Except as otherwise provided in this Code, each day that a violation of this Code continues shall constitute a
                  separate offense.
                  Violations of this Code that are continuous with respect to time are a public nuisance and may be abated by
                  injunctive or other equitable relief and by such other means as are provided by law. Further, any condition caused
                  or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this Code or any such ordinance, resolution, rules,
                  regulation or order shall be deemed a public nuisance and may be abated by the town as provided by law.
                  The imposition of a penalty does not prohibit equitable relief.
                  The imposition of a penalty does not prohibit revocation or suspension of a license, permit, or franchise or the
                  imposition of other administrative sanctions.
                  All fines shall be paid into the town treasury.
                  In the event community service is substituted for a fine, the monetary rate for hourly work shall be the federal
                  minimum hourly wage.
                  If it is deemed by a court of competent jurisdiction that a punishment imposed under this Code conflicts with the
                  laws of the state, the punishment shall be the maximum permitted by law.

                  shall be declared by the affirmative vote of a majority of the quorum of the town council, including the mayor in the

                  any regular meeting or any special or emergency meeting called for that purpose, but any such additional appropriations may be

                  recommended capital budget containing the means of financing the improvements proposed for the ensuing fiscal
                  year. The mayor and council shall have the power to accept, with or without amendments, or reject the proposed
                  plan and budget. The mayor and council shall not authorize an expenditure for the construction of any building,
                  structure, work, or improvement on any public property, unless the appropriations for such project are included in

                  of the citizens of the town, which emergency shall be declared by the affirmative vote of three members of the
                  council, including the mayor in the event of a tie vote.
                  If such a budget is submitted, the town council shall adopt by ordinance the final capital budget for the ensuing
                  fiscal year, not later than the regular December meeting before the beginning of said year. No appropriation
                  provided for in a prior capital improvements budget shall lapse until the purpose for which the appropriation was
                  made has been completed or abandoned. However, the mayor may submit to the town council amendments to the
                  capital budget at any time during the fiscal year, accompanied by recommendations. Any such amendments to the
                  capital budget shall become effective only upon their adoption by ordinance and by the affirmative vote of a
                  majority of a quorum of the town council including the mayor in the event of a tie vote. In addition, the capital
                  improvements budget may be revised and extended each year with regard to capital improvements still pending or
                  in the process of construction or acquisition.

                  Sec. 2-651. - Complaints.
                  Any person having a complaint against any member of the town council for an alleged ethics violation shall file in writing a
                  verified complaint setting forth the particular facts and circumstances which constitute the alleged violation against the member.
                  The complaint shall be filed with the mayor, or in the event the complaint regards the mayor, it shall be filed with the mayor pro
                  tem. Upon receipt of a complaint, the mayor, or in the event the complaint regards the mayor, the mayor pro tem shall appoint
                  three members of council, who, along with the town attorney, shall constitute an investigating committee to determine whether
                  the complaint sets forth significant facts and circumstances so as to warrant a hearing before the board of ethics. In the event the
                  complaint does not set forth sufficient facts to constitute an alleged violation and is found unjustified, frivolous or patently
                  unfounded, it shall be dismissed and the complainant notified immediately. In the event the complaint is found to state sufficient
                  facts to warrant a hearing before the board of ethics, the board shall be appointed as provided herein.
                  Sec. 2-652. - Board of ethics.
                  Composition. The board of ethics of the town shall be composed of five residents of the town to be appointed by

                  one year and shall be a registered voter. No person shall serve as a member or the board of ethics if the person has,
                  or has within the preceding one year period, any interest in any contract, transaction, or official action of the town.
                  Qualified potential member pool. The mayor and councilmembers shall each designate two qualified citizens to
                  provide a pool of 12 individuals who have consented to serve as a member of such board of ethics and who will be
                  available for a period of two years to be called upon to serve in the event a board of ethics is appointed.
                  Appointment of members from pool. Should the investigating committee determine a complaint warrants a hearing
                  before the board of ethics, the mayor and council, at the first public meeting after such determination, shall draw
                  names randomly from the listing of qualified citizens until the specified five members have been appointed. Such
                  board will elect one of its members to serve as chairman.

                  a period of three months;
                  To prescribe forms, approved by the town attorney, for the disclosure required in this article and to make
                  available to the public information disclosed as provided by this section;
                  To receive and hear complaints of violations of the standards required by this article;
                  To make such investigation and response to a complaint as it deems necessary to determine whether any
                  person has violated any provisions of this article;
                  To hold such hearings and make such inquires as deemed necessary to investigate and rule upon complaints;

                  of witnesses. The decision of the board of ethics shall be rendered to the mayor and council within five days after completion of
                  the hearing.

                  identity theft. Pursuant to 16 CFR 681.1, the purpose of this article is also to establish a process by which the town
                  will be able to form a reasonable belief that a consumer report relates to the consumer about whom it has
                  requested a consumer credit report when the town has received a notice of address discrepancy.
                  This article may be referred to as the town's identity theft prevention program or ITTP.
                  Sec. 2-721. - Denitions.

                  Any other account that the creditor offers or maintains for which there is a reasonably foreseeable risk to

                  Sec. 2-722. - Findings.
                  The town council has found as follows:
                  The town is a creditor pursuant to 16 CFR 681.2 due to its provision or maintenance of covered accounts for
                  which payment is made in arrears. Covered accounts offered to customers for the provision of town services
                  include water, sewer, solid waste, and stormwater.
                  The processes of opening a new covered account, restoring an existing covered account, making payments on
                  such accounts, and making payments for property taxes and other services have been identified as potential
                  processes in which identity theft could occur.
                  The town limits access to personal identifying information to those employees responsible for or otherwise
                  involved in opening or restoring covered accounts or accepting payment for use of covered accounts.
                  The town determines that there is a low risk of identity theft occurring in the following ways, if any:
                  Use by an applicant of another person's personal identifying information to establish a new covered
                  account;
                  Use of a previous customer's personal identifying information by another person in an effort to have
                  service restored in the previous customer's name;
                  Use of another person's credit card, bank account, or other method of payment by a customer to pay
                  such customer's covered account; and
                  Use by a customer desiring to restore such customer's covered account of another person's credit card,
                  bank account, or other method of payment.
                  Sec. 2-723. - Process of establishing a covered account.
                  As a precondition to opening a covered account with the town, each applicant shall provide the town with personal
                  identifying information of the customer in the form of a valid government issued identification card containing a
                  photograph of the customer or, for customers who are not natural persons, a photograph of the customer's agent
                  opening the account with written confirmation of being the authorized agent for the entity. The applicant shall also
                  provide any other information necessary for the department providing the service for which the covered account is
                  created. The information shall be entered directly into the town's records system and held in a secure storage area
                  with access limited to those town personnel with the need to know.
                  For each customer account for which the town may now or hereafter provide individual customer access to the
                  customer's account information, such account shall be assigned an account number and personal identification
                  number (PIN) which shall be unique to that account. The town may utilize computer software to randomly generate
                  assigned PINs and to encrypt account numbers and PINs.

                  provider, such third party service provider shall certify that it has an adequate identity theft prevention program in
                  place that is applicable to such payments.
                  All credit card payments made over the telephone or the town's website shall be entered directly into the

                  Account statements and receipts for covered accounts shall include only the last four digits of the credit or debit
                  card or the bank account used for payment of the covered account.
                  Sec. 2-728. - Sources and types of red ags.
                  All employees responsible for or involved in the process of opening a covered account, restoring a covered account or
                  accepting payment for a covered account shall check for red flags as indicators of possible identity theft and such red flags may
                  include:
                  Alerts from consumer reporting agencies, fraud detection agencies or service providers. Examples of alerts

                  reassembled.
                  Suspicious personal identification, such as suspicious address change. Examples of suspicious identifying
                  information include:
                  Personal identifying information that is inconsistent with external information sources used by the
                  financial institution or creditor, such as instances in which the address does not match any address in the
                  consumer report or the social security number (SSN) has not been issued, or is listed on the Social
                  Security Administration's death master file.
                  Personal identifying information provided by the customer is not consistent with other personal
                  identifying information provided by the customer, such as a lack of correlation between the SSN range
                  and date of birth.
                  Personal identifying information or a phone number or address is associated with known fraudulent
                  applications or activities as indicated by internal or third-party sources used by the financial institution or
                  creditor.
                  Other information provided, such as fictitious mailing addresses, mail drop addresses, jail addresses,
                  invalid phone numbers, pager numbers or answering services, is associated with fraudulent activity.
                  The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other applicants or customers.
                  The address or telephone number provided is the same as or similar to the account number or telephone
                  number submitted by an unusually large number of applicants or customers.
                  The applicant or customer fails to provide all required personal identifying information on an application
                  or in response to notification that the application is incomplete.
                  Personal identifying information is not consistent with personal identifying information that is on file with
                  the financial institution or creditor.
                  The applicant or customer cannot provide authenticating information beyond that which generally would
                  be available from a wallet or consumer report.
                  Unusual use of or suspicious activity relating to a covered account. Examples of suspicious activity include:
                  Shortly following the notice of a change of address for an account, the town receives a request for the
                  addition of authorized users on the account.
                  A new revolving credit account is used in a manner commonly associated with known patterns of fraud
                  patterns as in instances where the customer fails to make the first payment or makes an initial payment
                  but no subsequent payments.
                  An account is used in a manner that is not consistent with established patterns of activity on the account,
                  such as instances where there is nonpayment when there is no history of late or missed payments or a
                  material change in purchasing or spending patterns;
                  An account that has been inactive for a long period of time is used, taking into consideration the type of
                  account, the expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors.
                  Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable although transactions continue to be
                  conducted in connection with the customer's account.
                  The town is notified that the customer is not receiving paper account statements.

                  The town is notified by a customer, law enforcement or another person that it has opened a fraudulent acco
                  engaged in identity theft.
                  Notice from customers, law enforcement, victims or other reliable sources regarding possible identity theft or
                  phishing relating to covered accounts.
                  Sec. 2-729. - Procedure regarding existing covered accounts.
                  In the event that any town employee responsible for or involved in restoring an existing covered account or
                  accepting payment for a covered account becomes aware of red flags indicating possible identity theft with respect
                  to existing covered accounts, such employee shall use his discretion to determine whether such red flag or
                  combination of red flags suggests a threat of identity theft.
                  If, in his discretion, the employee determines that identity theft or attempted identity theft is likely or probable, the
                  employee shall immediately report such red flags to his department head.
                  If, in his discretion, the employee deems that identity theft is unlikely or that reliable information is available to
                  reconcile red flags, the employee shall convey this information to his department head, who may in his discretion
                  determine that no further action is necessary.
                  If the department head in his discretion determines that further action is necessary, a town employee shall perform
                  one or more of the following responses, as determined to be appropriate by the department head:
                  Contact the customer;
                  If, after contacting the customer, it is apparent that someone other than the customer has accessed the
                  customer's covered account, change any account numbers, passwords, security codes, or other security
                  devices that permit access to an account, or close the account;
                  Cease attempts to collect additional charges from the customer for the covered account in question and
                  decline to sell the customer's account to a debt collector in the event that the customer's account has been
                  accessed without authorization and such access has caused additional charges to accrue;
                  Notify a debt collector within 24 hours of the discovery of likely or probable identity theft relating to a
                  customer account that has been sold to such debt collector in the event that a customer's account has been
                  sold to a debt collector prior to the discovery of the likelihood or probability of identity theft relating to such
                  account;
                  Notify law enforcement, in the event that someone other than the customer has accessed the customer's
                  account causing additional charges to accrue or accessing personal identifying information; or
                  Take other appropriate action as determined by the department head to prevent or mitigate identity theft.
                  Sec. 2-730. - Procedure regarding new covered accounts.
                  In the event that any town employee responsible for or involved in opening a new covered account becomes aware
                  of red flags indicating possible identity theft with respect an application for a new account, the employee shall use
                  his or her discretion to determine whether such red flag or combination of red flags suggests a threat of identity
                  theft.
                  If, in his discretion, the employee determines that identity theft or attempted identity theft is likely or probable, the
                  employee shall immediately report such red flags to his department head.
                  If, in his discretion, the employee deems that identity theft is unlikely or that reliable information is available to
                  reconcile red flags, the employee shall convey this information to his department head, who may in his or her
                  discretion determine that no further action is necessary.
                  If the department head in his discretion determines that further action is necessary, a town employee shall perform
                  one or more of the following responses, as determined to be appropriate by the department head:

                  material changes to the program, as necessary in the opinion of the town council, to address changing identity theft
                  risks and to identify new or discontinued types of covered accounts.
                  Department heads shall report to the town council at least annually, on compliance with the red flag requirements.
                  The department head reports will address material matters related to the program and evaluate issues such as:

                  Service provider arrangements;
                  Significant incidents involving identity theft and management's response; and
                  Recommendations for material amendments of this article.

                  In the event that the town receives a notice of address discrepancy, the town employee responsible for verifying consumer
                  addresses for the purpose of providing the town service or account sought by the consumer shall verify the information in the
                  consumer report with the consumer or compare the information in the consumer report with:
                  Information the town obtains and uses to verify a consumer's identity in accordance with the requirements of
                  the customer information program rules implementing 31 USC 5318(l);
                  Information the town maintains in its own records, such as applications for service, change of address notices,
                  other customer account records or tax records; or

                  town is required to provide such address to the consumer reporting agency from which the town received a notice
                  of address discrepancy with respect to such consumer. This information is required to be provided to the consumer
                  reporting agency when:
                  The town is able to form a reasonable belief that the consumer report relates to the consumer about whom
                  the town requested the report;
                  The town establishes a continuing relationship with the consumer; and
                  The town regularly and in the ordinary course of business provides information to the consumer reporting
                  agency from which it received the notice of address discrepancy.
                  Such information shall be provided to the consumer reporting agency as part of the information regularly provided
                  by the town to such agency for the reporting period in which the town establishes a relationship with the customer.
                  Sec. 2-754. - Methods of conrming consumer addresses.
                  The town employee charged with confirming consumer addresses may, in his discretion, confirm the accuracy of an address
                  through verifying the address with the consumer, reviewing the town's records to verify the consumer's address, verifying the
                  address through third-party sources, or using other reasonable processes.

                  and all fees paid.
                  The issuance or renewal of a license under this article for any calendar year or any portion thereof shall not be
                  deemed to vest the licensee or any person having an interest in the business with any right to renewal thereof.
                  Upon receipt of an application for renewal of an existing license issued pursuant to this article, the clerk shall
                  forward same to the chief of police, who shall then provide a report on any criminal activity of the licensee, his
                  employees, agents, or other representatives, or at the location of the licensed premises during the year.
                  In considering an application for renewal of an existing license issued pursuant to this article, the council shall be
                  guided by the considerations and guidelines set forth in this Code. The council may take the same action regarding
                  renewal applications that it is empowered to take with regard to an initial application, as set forth in this Code. If the
                  application for renewal is denied, the annual license fee shall be refunded to the applicant.

                  business, with the exception of holidays, vacations, and periods of renovation, redecoration, or other substantial
                  improvements that would prohibit the operation of business. In the event the licensee shall cease to be actively
                  engaged in the business, or the business is not opened to the public for a period of 60 consecutive days, the license
                  shall expire, and the licensee shall immediately surrender the license to the town.
                  Similarly, if the applicant for a license has not commenced operation of business on the proposed licensed premises
                  within 120 days of the issuance of the license, then the license shall lapse and become void. In this event, a new
                  application shall be submitted according to this Code.
                  If a license lapses or expires under this Code section, the licensee shall not be entitled to a refund or proration of
                  any fees, taxes, or other charges levied pursuant to this article.
                  Sec. 4-44. - Familiarity with chapter.
                  It shall be the duty of each licensee to maintain a copy of this chapter on the premises, and to instruct each
                  employee as to the terms thereof; and each licensee and employee shall at all times be familiar with this chapter.
                  Licensees are charged with the responsibility for compliance with this chapter by their officers, agents, servants and
                  employees. Licensees are responsible and shall be subject to license probation, suspension, or revocation for any
                  violations accruing upon the licensed premises by any officer, agent, servant, or employee.
                  Sec. 4-45. - Display of license.
                  Holders of licenses issued pursuant to this article shall display them prominently and in plain view at all times on the premises

                  The town council shall have full power and authority to suspend, revoke, refuse to renew, or place on probation any licensee
                  for violations of this chapter, other provisions of this code or town ordinances, or state or federal law or regulation, or when the

                  Sec. 4-95. - Grounds for suspension or revocation.
                  The following shall be considered just cause for the suspension or revocation of a license issued under this article:
                  The making of any statement in an application for a license issued or under which shall later be found to be

                  local law or regulation, other than traffic violations, which would tend to reflect on the holder's ability to
                  comply with this chapter or render them unqualified to continue to hold a license issued hereunder. The
                  determination of whether any such violation has occurred may be made by the town council by a
                  preponderance of the evidence, and an actual conviction in any court for such offense shall not be necessary
                  in order to take adverse action against the license.
                  The failure of a retail dealer or the employee of a retail dealer to report promptly to the police department of
                  the town any violation of a law or municipal ordinance, breach of the peace, disturbance or altercation
                  resulting in violence, occuring on the premises where the business is conducted under such retail license.
                  The entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, or the conviction of any licensee, partner, or any officer,
                  director or stockholder of a licensee corporation with respect to a charge of violation of any town, state or
                  federal law state relating to alcohol control, or any crime, whether a felony or not, involving moral turpitude.
                  The suspension, revocation, or any other adverse action taken against the license holder's state retail dealer's
                  license.
                  Any conduct on the part of the license holder or his agents, employees, or representatives that is contrary to
                  the public welfare, health, safety, or morals, to the extent that such conduct affects or impacts the holder's
                  ability to continue to comply with this article or renders him unqualified to continue to hold a license issued
                  hereunder.
                  The license holder's default on any obligation of any kind whatsoever lawfully owing to the town, or the
                  general failure to demonstrate adequate financial responsibilities regarding the business.

                  original to the license holder at the licensed premises with a copy to any other address of the license holder
                  contained in the most recent license application or renewal.

                  regarding certiorari from the municipal court to the superior court.
                  Any adverse action taken by the town with regard to a license issued pursuant to this article shall not preclude, and
                  may be in addition to, any criminal prosecution by any proper authority of the town, county, state, or federal

                  The town council shall have the right to make such inquiry or investigation as it may find to be reasonably necessary to
                  determine the licensee's compliance or noncompliance with this chapter. Such investigation may consist, among other actions, of
                  calling licensees for examination under oath, obtaining evidence under oath from other persons, the procurement of documents
                  and records including records of the licensee, and inspection and examination of records and documents from whatever source
                  obtainable.
                  Sec. 4-98. - Licensee's obligation to notify bonding company of disciplinary action.

                  hereof of any fines imposed by the town pursuant to this section, and provide written proof to the town of such notice, in order to
                  facilitate payment of such fines. If the license holder fails to provide the town with proof of notice of any fines to the bonding
                  company within ten days after the fine is imposed, the town may provide such notice.
                  Sec. 4-99. - Reinstatement time for revoked licenses.
                  Notwithstanding provisions of this article permitting reinstatement, when a license has been revoked under the provisions of

                  amount has been paid or a certificate stating that no amount is due.

                  notice to the purchase at the purchaser's address as it appears on the records of the license division, department of
                  finance, of the amount that must be paid as a condition of issuing the certificate. The time within which the
                  obligation of a successor may be enforced shall start to run at the time the operator sells the business or at the time

                  overpaid or paid more than once, which fact has not been determined by the administrator, the person will have three years from
                  date of payment to file claim in writing stating the specific ground upon which claim is founded. The claim shall be audited. If the
                  claim is approved, the excess amount paid the town may be credited on any amounts due and payable from the person by whom
                  it was paid or the person's successors.

                  Sec. 6-148. - Purpose and intent.
                  The purpose of this chapter is to regulate certain types of businesses, including but not limited to, adult entertainment
                  establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed;
                  provided, however, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition. Otherwise a protected form of
                  expression would vanish. As to adult dance establishments, this chapter represents a balancing of competing interests—reduced
                  criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.
                  Sec. 6-149. - Unlawful operation declared nuisance.
                  Any adult entertainment establishment operated, conducted or maintained contrary to the provisions of this chapter shall be
                  and the same is hereby declared to be unlawful and a public nuisance. The town may, in addition to, or in lieu of prosecuting a
                  quasi-criminal action hereunder, commence an action or actions, proceeding or proceedings for abatement, removal or
                  enjoinment thereof, in the manner provided by law. It shall take such other steps and shall apply to such court or courts as may
                  have jurisdiction to grant such relief as will abate or remove such adult entertainment establishment and restrain and enjoin any
                  person from operation, conduction or maintaining an adult entertainment establishment contrary to the provisions of this chapter.

                  shall be held at the county animal control shelter. When such space is not available, such animals may be held at
                  any licensed veterinary facility, kennel, or other similar facility.
                  The owner of any impounded animal is liable for any and all costs, fees, and expenses of holding the animal until
                  reclaimed.
                  The animal control officer shall make a diligent effort to ascertain the owner of the animal; and shall give the owner
                  prompt notice of the fact of impoundment. Notice shall be given by the best means possible to assure actual receipt
                  by the owner. For purposes of this section, written notice to the owner by certified mail, at the address shown on
                  the most current registration form shall be deemed complete upon its mailing. If the owner is personally served, the
                  notice may be left with a person of responsible age residing at the address, or conspicuously tacked on the main
                  entrance thereof. If the identity of the owner cannot be ascertained, a notice will be posted on the bulletin board at
                  town hall. The notice shall advise the owner that the animal will be held for a period of ten days, exclusive of the
                  date of service, and thereafter the animal may be disposed of in accordance with this section. The notice shall state
                  the location and hours of the facility where the animal may be reclaimed, and shall specify the cost for reclaiming
                  the animal.
                  In addition to the actual fees, costs and expenses of sheltering the animal, the animal control officer shall charge
                  and assess such fees for pick-up and impoundment as set forth in a schedule approved by the town council, as may
                  be from time to time amended. If the owner cannot show proof of current rabies vaccination, the animal shall be
                  vaccinated by a licensed veterinarian before release, and the cost thereof collected from the owner.
                  Any impounded animal may be disposed of on or after the tenth day after date of service of notice on the owner if
                  the owner is known or publication if the owner is unknown. Disposal of animals shall be made by adoption or by
                  destruction in an expedient and humane manner. Animals may be held beyond the period stated if circumstances
                  warrant.
                  If any dead dog or cat is found upon the public right-of-way, the town shall remove and dispose of the animal and
                  charge the owner, if known, a fee in the amount provided in the town fee schedule.

                  In the alternative to impounding an animal under the provisions of this article, the owner of such animal shall be cited to
                  appear in the municipal court to answer charges for the violation of the provision of this article; provided, however, such citation
                  shall not preclude the impoundment of the animal.

                  Sec. 8-32. - Nuisance; abatement.
                  Whenever any animal is kept in such a manner as to constitute a nuisance, a proceeding to abate the nuisance may be brought
                  by the party aggrieved in the municipal court. An animal found by the court to constitute a nuisance may be impounded by the
                  town if the owner, after reasonable opportunity to do so, fails to abate the nuisance as ordered by the court. The losing party in

                  order the dog or cat held on the owner's premises or shall have it impounded at the owner's expense for a period of
                  two weeks.
                  The dog or cat shall be examined immediately after it has bitten anyone and again at the end of the two-week
                  period. If at the end of two weeks a veterinarian is convinced that the dog or cat is then free from rabies, the dog or
                  cat shall be released from quarantine.

                  of probable cause and presentation of proper credentials, authorized agents of the building department may enter,
                  at reasonable times, any building, structure, or premises in the town in order to enforce this article.
                  Any property, building, equipment, appliance, or system installed, constructed, erected, altered, repaired,
                  maintained, or used in the town shall be subject to inspection by the building department.
                  No official or employee of the building department making inspection of properties for the purpose of determining
                  the necessity for repairs or corrections shall have any financial interest, directly or indirectly, in any repairs or
                  corrections which may be required by this article.
                  Sec. 10-277. - Inspection warrant.
                  The building department, in addition to other procedures provided, may obtain an inspection warrant under the
                  conditions specified in this chapter. The warrant shall authorize the director or agents thereof to conduct a search
                  or inspection of property, either with or without the consent of the person whose property is to be searched or
                  inspected, under the conditions set out in this article. Inspection warrants may be issued by the municipal court
                  when the issuing judge is satisfied that all of the following conditions are met:
                  The person seeking the warrant must establish under oath or affirmation that the property to be inspected is
                  to be inspected as a part of a legally authorized program of inspection which includes that property or that
                  there is probable cause for believing that there is a condition, object, activity, or circumstance which legally
                  justifies such an inspection of that property.
                  The issuing judge determines that the issuance of the warrant is authorized by this article.
                  The inspection warrant shall be issued only if it meets all of the following requirements:
                  The warrant is attached to the affidavit required to be made in order to obtain the warrant.
                  The warrant describes, either directly or by reference to the affidavit, the property upon which the inspection
                  is to occur and is sufficiently accurate that the executor of the warrant and the owner or possessor of the
                  property can reasonably determine from it the property for which the warrant authorizes an inspection.
                  The warrant indicates the conditions, objects, activities, or circumstances which the inspection is intended to
                  check or reveal.
                  The warrant refers, in general terms, to the ordinance provisions sought to be enforced.

                  The building department may place a dated and signed placard on property which is in violation of this article, and

                  the building has been placarded. Such notice shall specify the reason therefor and the owner's right of appeal as
                  provided in this chapter. Such placard shall contain the following words:
                  "The town of Mount Airy has declared this building dangerous and unfit for human habitation. The use or habitation
                  of this building is prohibited and unlawful."
                  It shall be unlawful for a person to occupy the dwelling, structure, or premises or for an owner to allow occupancy of
                  a dwelling, structure, or premises which has been placarded, if such dwelling, structure, or premises is, or becomes,
                  vacant after placarding or, in all events, within 60 days from the date of placarding unless the violation has been
                  corrected.
                  The posting of the placard and the recording of same in the records of the building department shall be notice to
                  the general public that it is unlawful for any owner to allow the dwelling or structure to be occupied, as provided
                  herein. No further notice shall be required to be given to any subsequent owner.
                  It shall be unlawful to deface, alter, destroy, cover, or remove such placards. The building department shall remove
                  the placards when compliance with this article has been effected.

                  Sec. 10-280. - Stopping work.
                  Whenever the building department determines defective or illegal work is performed in violation of a provision or requirement
                  of this article, it shall order, in writing, all further work to be stopped until such defective or illegal work is corrected.
                  Sec. 10-281. - Failure of owner to correct; abatement by town; lien on property.
                  In the event the owner or parties in interest fail to comply with an order to vacate and close or repair or demolish the dwelling,
                  building, or structure and clean the premises, or remedy any other condition found to exist in violation of this chapter or any other
                  relevant ordinance of the town, the town may proceed to abate the nuisance as provided in chapter 30.

                  and shall have the duty of inspecting all licensed premises as often as in their judgment it may seem necessary to determine that
                  the license held is the proper one for the business sought to be transacted thereunder. The revenue collection officer and his

                  collection officer, upon any tax or installment of said tax becoming delinquent and remaining unpaid, shall issue
                  execution for the correct amount of said tax against the persons, partnership, or corporation liable for said tax,
                  which said execution shall bear full interest at the rate of 12 percent per annum from the date when such tax or
                  installment becomes delinquent, and the lien shall cover the property of the person, partnership, or corporation
                  liable for said tax.
                  The lien of said occupation tax shall become fixed on and date from the time when such tax or any installment
                  thereof became delinquent. The execution shall be levied by the revenue collection officer upon the property of
                  defendant located in the town, and sufficient property shall be advertised and sold to pay the amount of said
                  execution, with interest and costs.
                  When a nulla bona entry has been entered by proper authority upon an execution issued by the revenue collection
                  officer against any person defaulting on the license tax, the person against whom the entry was made shall not be
                  allowed or entitled to have or collect any fees or charges whatsoever for services rendered after the entry of the
                  nulla bona. If at any time after the entry of nulla bona has been made, the person against whom the execution
                  issues pays the tax in full together with all interest and costs accrued on the tax, the person may collect any fees
                  and charges due him as though he had never defaulted in the payment of the taxes.
                  Sec. 12-80. - Inspections of books and records; penalties for underreporting.
                  The town revenue collection officer or his designees may inspect the books of the business for which the returns are
                  made under this chapter. Books and records demanded by the revenue collection officer or his designees shall be
                  submitted to the town for inspection within 30 days of request. Failure to timely submit requested books and
                  records shall be grounds for revocation of any license issued hereunder.
                  If, after examination of the books or records, it is determined that a deficiency occurs as a result of underreporting,
                  a penalty of 125 percent of the prime interest rate will be assessed for the period audited. For purposes of this
                  section, the prime interest rate shall be that which is published by the Wall Street Journal on the first business day
                  of the year in which the underreporting is identified.

                  To promote civil stability and to provide basic services to the town in the case of emergencies or hazardous inclement weather,
                  it is essential that the town be able to maintain an adequate workforce. Toward that end, the following rules shall apply during any
                  state of emergency declared by authorized state, county, or town officials:
                  Essential employees shall be required to report to work at their regular shift unless called in early by their
                  immediate supervisor or the mayor.
                  The mayor, in consultation as necessary with town department heads and county emergency management
                  officials, shall decide whether to open the town hall and other town work facilities. It shall be their
                  responsibility to notify town officers if town hall is to be closed. If town hall is open, all employees in all offices
                  are expected to report for their assigned shift. If town hall is not opened for business at the regular opening
                  hour, all employees are required to check in periodically for updates. Employees will not be paid for regular
                  hours that town hall is not in operation.
                  Any employee not able to report for their assigned shift may take annual leave for those hours. If an employee
                  reports for work and is then sent home by the closing of the town hall, the employee will be paid for the
                  remainder of the day.

                  Sec. 18-19. - Authorization.
                  Georgia Constitution article IX, § II and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to
                  adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
                  (Ord. of 6-18-2008, art. 1, § A)
                  Sec. 18-20. - Findings of fact.
                  The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property,
                  health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures
                  for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety
                  and general welfare.
                  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are
                  inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of
                  obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.

                  Sec. 18-21. - Denitions.
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section,
                  except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
                  Accessory structure means a structure having minimal value and used for parking, storage and other nonhabitable uses, such
                  as garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, hay sheds and the like.
                  Addition (to an existing building) means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a building in which the addition
                  is connected by a common load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition which is connected by a firewall
                  or is separated by an independent perimeter load-bearing wall shall be considered new construction.
                  Appeal means a request for a review of the town administrator's interpretation of any provision of this article.
                  Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood
                  depths from one to three feet, and/or where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable
                  and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident.

                  materials;
                  Hospitals and nursing homes, and housing for the elderly, which are likely to contain occupants who may not
                  be sufficiently mobile to avoid the loss of life or injury during flood and storm events;
                  Emergency operation centers or data storage centers which contain records or services that may become lost

                  other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling operations, and storage of materials or equipment.
                  Elevated building means a nonbasement building built to have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area elevated above the
                  ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns, piers, or shear walls adequately anchored so as
                  not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a base flood event.
                  Existing construction means any structure for which the start of construction commenced before June 2, 2008.
                  Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction
                  of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of
                  utilities, the construction of streets, and final site-grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before June 2, 2008.
                  Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the
                  construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of
                  utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads.
                  Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
                  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or

                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to
                  discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height.
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management.
                  Freeboard tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height
                  calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of
                  urbanization of the watershed.
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the
                  proposed foundation of a building.
                  Historic structure means any structure that is:
                  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of

                  preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or
                  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places and determined as eligible by communities with
                  historic preservation programs that have been certified either:
                  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or
                  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.

                  Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more
                  manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various
                  elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of this article, the term "mean sea level" is synonymous with National Geodetic

                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD), as corrected in 1929, means a vertical control used as a reference for establishing
                  varying elevations within the floodplain.
                  New construction means any structure (see Structure) for which the start of construction commenced on or after June 2, 2008,
                  and includes any subsequent improvements to the structure.
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of
                  facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of
                  utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site-grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after June 2,
                  2008.
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD), as corrected in 1988, means a vertical control used as a reference for establishing
                  varying elevations within the floodplain.
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle, which is:
                  Built on a single chassis;
                  400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;
                  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and
                  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational,
                  camping, travel, or seasonal use.
                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
                  reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The "actual start" means the first placement of permanent
                  construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work
                  beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction
                  does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
                  walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor
                  does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not
                  occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: Accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance
                  requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the term "actual start" of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling,
                  floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage
                  tank.
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development.
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its
                  before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place
                  during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to
                  the start of construction of the improvement. The market value of the structure should be:
                  The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or
                  In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring.
                  This definition includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair
                  work performed. For the purposes of this definition, the term "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when
                  the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that

                  alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term "substantial improvement" does not, however,
                  include those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary,
                  or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions and which have been
                  identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project; or any
                  alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as
                  a historic structure.
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or
                  improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the
                  repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise
                  prohibited by this article.
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain
                  management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other
                  evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private
                  losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
                  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood
                  damage at the time of initial construction;
                  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards,
                  or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
                  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;

                  Review proposed development to ensure that the permit requirements of this article have been satisfied.
                  Review proposed development to ensure all necessary permits have been received from governmental
                  agencies from which approval is required by federal or state law, including section 404 of the Federal Water
                  Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 USC 1344. Require that copies of such permits be provided and
                  maintained on file.
                  Review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from
                  flooding.
                  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 18-41,
                  obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state
                  or other sources in order to administer the provisions of division 4 of this chapter.
                  Review and record the actual elevation in relation to mean sea level (or highest adjacent grade) of the lowest
                  floor, including basement, of all new or substantially improved structures in accordance with section 18-59(2).
                  Verify and record the actual elevation, in relation to mean sea level to which any new or substantially improved
                  structures have been floodproofed, in accordance with section 18-59(2).
                  When floodproofing is utilized for a structure, obtain certification of design criteria from a registered
                  professional engineer or architect in accordance with section 18-59(1)c and section 18-81(2) or 18-83(2).

                  Sec. 18-80. - General standards.
                  In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions apply:
                  New construction of principal buildings (residential or nonresidential), including manufactured homes, shall
                  not be allowed within the limits of the future-conditions floodplain.
                  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation,
                  collapse or lateral movement of the structure.
                  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and
                  utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
                  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and
                  practices that minimize flood damage.
                  All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area
                  located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an
                  unfinished and flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces
                  on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. Designs for complying with this
                  requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
                  criteria:
                  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every
                  square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
                  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and
                  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they
                  permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction.
                  So as not to violate the lowest floor criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure shall only
                  be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the
                  premises, or entry to the elevated area.
                  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
                  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation,
                  plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or
                  accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
                  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of
                  anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This
                  standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces.
                  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of
                  floodwaters into the system.
                  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of
                  floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.

                  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new
                  construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest
                  floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid
                  foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood
                  hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 18-
                  80. All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation,
                  plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation.
                  Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in
                  the A1-A30, AE, or AH zone, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant
                  utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with
                  walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of
                  resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer
                  or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted
                  standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set
                  forth in subsection (1) of this section and in section 18-80
                  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available:
                  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on:
                  Individual lots or parcels;
                  In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions;
                  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or
                  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has
                  incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood;
                  Must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood
                  elevation.
                  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or
                  subdivision may be elevated so that either:
                  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of
                  the base flood elevation; or
                  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation
                  elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade.
                  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to
                  resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (See section 18-80).
                  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
                  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;

                  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 18-25 are areas designated as
                  floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion
                  potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the
                  base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
                  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or
                  other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted, however, provided it
                  is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard
                  engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway
                  widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting
                  technical data and certification thereof.
                  Only if subsection (4)a of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement
                  shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division.

                  Sec. 18-82. - Building standards for streams without established base ood elevations and/or oodways (A zones).
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 18-25, where streams exist but no base flood
                  data have been provided (A zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been
                  delineated, the following provisions apply:
                  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 18-25
                  then the town administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood
                  elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the
                  provisions of this division. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions
                  (subsections (a)(2) and (3) of this section) shall apply:
                  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of
                  the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by
                  a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more
                  than a one-foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
                  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial
                  improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
                  basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (The lowest
                  floor is to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A zone areas where a limited detail
                  study has been completed.) Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be
                  provided in accordance with standards of section 18-80. All heating and air conditioning equipment and
                  components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be
                  elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site.
                  The town administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part
                  of the permit file.

                  Areas of special flood hazard established in section 18-25 may include designated AO shallow flooding areas. These areas have
                  base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply:
                  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the
                  lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate
                  map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including
                  basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to
                  facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section
                  18-80. The town administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a
                  permanent part of the permit file.
                  New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of
                  elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be
                  watertight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially
                  impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic
                  and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall
                  certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for
                  meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as
                  required in section 18-59(1)c and (2).
                  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.

                  Following are the standards for subdivisions:
                  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
                  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas,
                  electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage;
                  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to
                  flood hazards; and
                  For subdivisions and/or developments greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less, base flood elevation
                  data shall be provided for subdivision and all other proposed development, including manufactured home
                  parks and subdivisions. Any changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM
                  shall be submitted to FEMA for review as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or a conditional letter of
                  map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. Upon completion of the project, the developer is
                  responsible for submitting the as-built data to FEMA in order to obtain the final LOMR.

                  Sec. 18-109. - Requirements and conditions.
                  The zoning board, as established by city council, shall hear and decide requests for appeal or variance from the
                  requirements of this article.
                  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination
                  is made by the town administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article.
                  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the zoning board may appeal such decision to the superior court of the
                  county, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1.
                  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the
                  proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
                  the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
                  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the
                  criteria of this division are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that
                  minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
                  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
                  discharge would result.
                  In reviewing such requests, the zoning board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all
                  standards specified in this and other sections of this article.
                  Conditions for variances.
                  A variance shall be issued only when there is:
                  A finding of good and sufficient cause;
                  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
                  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional
                  threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense; create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization
                  of the public; or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
                  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from
                  the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
                  variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a
                  historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic
                  character and design of the building.
                  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between
                  the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood
                  insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest
                  floor elevation.
                  The town administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal
                  Emergency Management Agency upon request.
                  Upon consideration of the factors listed in this section and the purposes of this article, the zoning board may attach
                  such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  carrying out the strict letter of the code; provided, however, that the spirit of the code shall be observed and the public safety
                  secured. The particulars of any modification when granted or allowed, and the decision of the fire chief thereon, shall be entered
                  upon the records of the department, and a signed copy shall be forwarded to the applicant.

                  It shall be unlawful for any person to obstruct in any manner any firefighting apparatus or any of the officers or members of

                  this connection, the minimum standards promulgated in such cases by the National Board of Fire Underwriters shall be considered
                  as prima facie evidence of such hazard.

                  During an air pollution episode declared by the proper authorities, no open burning of any kind shall be permitted unless open
                  burning is required in the performance of an official duty of any public office, or a fire is necessary to thwart or prevent a hazard

                  Any fire burning uncontrolled on any forested or cut-over brush land or grassland is declared to be a public nuisance by

                  to control or extinguish it immediately. If such person shall refuse or neglect to do so, or any other fire suppression force, may
                  suppress the nuisance thus constituted by controlling and extinguishing the fire, and, in addition to any fines and/or penalties that
                  may be imposed under this article, the cost of controlling and extinguishing the fire may be recovered from the responsible

                  Sec. 22-99. - Notice and permit requirements; exceptions.

                  It shall not be necessary to obtain a permit otherwise required by this section if a sudden emergency requires a
                  firing in order to render one's premises safe. In any prosecution under this section, a necessary firing in a sudden
                  emergency shall constitute an affirmative defense, but the burden of proving such necessary firing shall rest upon
                  the person asserting it as a defense.
                  Subject to the limitations and conditions otherwise provided in this section, it shall not be necessary to obtain a
                  permit otherwise required to burn improved pastures, residue on cultivated crop land, or leaf piles if the person or
                  association intending to burn such residue shall, prior to such burning, give notice of the approximate time and
                  location thereof to the mayor and town council or to an employee of the town who is authorized to grant permits.
                  The notice and permit required by this section shall be in addition to any other requirement for burning provided
                  for by this Code or state law or regulation.

                  of a violation at one site shall be considered adequate notice of the rules and regulations and subsequently observed violations by
                  the same person at the same or different site will result in immediately appropriate legal action by the town.
                  Sec. 22-101. - Opting out of administrative regulations.
                  The town intends that this article be read in conjunction with, and interpreted so as to not conflict with, Ga. Adm. Code § 391-
                  3-1-.02 (5). However, where Ga. Adm. Code § 391-3-1-.02(5) permits conduct but also allows local governments to prohibit that
                  conduct by ordinance, the conduct shall be prohibited unless expressly allowed by the provisions of this article.
                  Sec. 22-102. - No exception to burning prohibitions for materials that produce noxious and poisonous gases.

                  they constitute a nuisance or otherwise violate the provisions of this article, this Code or applicable state or federal
                  laws. The judge shall have the authority to abate the nuisance by ordering, in writing, that action he deems
                  appropriate to be taken to abate the nuisance, upon the recommendation of the inspector. He shall further have
                  the right to set such time limitations concerning the abatement or removal of the nuisance as may be proper.

                  violations of this article to be offenses punishable as provided in section 1-11. For each day that an order of the
                  municipal court is violated, this shall constitute and be considered a separate offense by which fine or
                  imprisonment may be considered by the court in order to enforce its orders of abatement of nuisances.

                  provisions, if the owner or the person in possession of the property has not abated the nuisance after the expiration
                  of five days from the date of the adjudication by the judge of the municipal court, or five days after the date given by
                  the judge for abatement, then the inspector may thereafter cause the nuisance to be abated and the objectionable
                  conditions to be removed from the property. The inspector shall be authorized to charge the cost and expense
                  thereof to the owner of or the person in possession.

                  That the type of structure, topography of the land, or other unusual circumstances means that the normal time
                  period for abatement of any such nuisance should be extended; or

                  structure which are dangerous or injurious to the health, safety, or morals of the occupants of such dwelling,
                  building, or structure; of the occupants of neighborhood dwelling, buildings, or structures; or of other residents of
                  the town. Such conditions may include the following (without limiting the generality of the foregoing):

                  building permit shall be obtained from the town for its reconstruction and repair:
                  Not more than 90 calendar days from the day that insurance proceeds, if any, are paid to the owner or
                  mortage holder associated with the burned structure;
                  Not more than 90 calendar days from the date the property insurer declines to pay a claim made with regard
                  to the burned structured;
                  Not more than 90 calendar days from the date of the fire that damaged or destroyed the building if no

                  the property owner in the same manner as for a traffic violation or other offense in municipal court or, alternatively,
                  issue a complaint in rem against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building, or
                  structure is situated or where such public health hazard of general nuisance exists and shall cause summons and a
                  copy of the complaint to be served on the owner and parties in interest in such dwelling, building, or structure.

                  which such costs were incurred.
                  The lien provided for in this section shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order

                  such costs are waived by resolution of the county. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall
                  be deposited in the general fund of county to pay the cost of administering the lien.

                  person takes flight upon the appearance of a law enforcement officer, refuses to identify his self or any object in his
                  possession. Unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it impracticable, a law enforcement officer
                  shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or
                  immediate concern which would otherwise be warranted by requesting the person to identify himself and explain
                  his presence and conduct.
                  No person shall be convicted of an offense under this section if the law enforcement officer failed to comply with
                  the foregoing procedure or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and would have
                  dispelled the alarm or immediate concern.

                  DIVISION 2. - CURFEW
                  Sec. 32-221. - Findings.
                  The town council has determined that:
                  Persons under the age of 18 years are particularly susceptible by their lack of maturity and experience to
                  participate in unlawful activity and to be victims of older perpetrators of crime.
                  There has been a significant breakdown in the supervision and guidance normally provided by parents for
                  minors resulting in an increase in the crimes, substance abuse, school dropout rates, juvenile pregnancy, and
                  other illicit behavior.
                  The town has an obligation to provide for the protection of minors from each other and from other persons,
                  for the enforcement of parental control over and responsibility for children, for the protection of the general
                  public, and for the reduction of the incidence of juvenile criminal activities which are not easily controlled by
                  existing laws and ordinances.
                  A curfew for those under the age of 18 years will be in the interest of the public health, safety, and general
                  welfare and will help attain the foregoing objectives and diminish the undesirable impact of such conduct on
                  the citizens of the town and will promote the public good, safety and welfare.
                  Parental responsibility for the whereabouts of children is the accepted norm and legal sanctions to enforce
                  such responsibility have had demonstrated effectiveness in many cities.
                  A curfew will increase parental responsibility for minors within their control and decrease minor delinquency.
                  Sec. 32-222. - Denitions.
                  For the purposes of this division, the following definitions shall apply:
                  Emergency errand means a mission that results from an unforeseen combination of circumstances that call for immediate
                  action. The term "emergency errand" includes, but is not limited to, a fire, a natural disaster, or automobile accident, or any
                  situation requiring immediate action to prevent serious bodily injury or loss of life.
                  Minor means any unemancipated person under the age of 18 years.
                  Public place means any place to which the public has access and includes, but is not limited to, streets, highways, alleys or
                  rights-of-way, to include sidewalks, parks, playgrounds, malls, or other places or buildings open to the public; any cemeteries,
                  school yards, bodies of water or watercourses; any privately or publicly owned places of amusement, entertainment or public

                  The following qualifications shall apply to all employees and managers:
                  No permit shall be issued until a signed application has been filed with the town, and a search of the criminal
                  record of the person completed. Such application shall include the applicant's name, fingerprints, social
                  security number, date of birth, and prior arrest record, although an applicant's arrest record shall be used for
                  investigative purposes only and shall not give rise to a presumption or inference of guilt. Applicant must also
                  provide positive identification (only government issued pictured identification accepted, e.g., driver's license,
                  passport, military card, or state ID card).
                  The chief of police or his designee shall conduct a search relative to any police record of the applicant.
                  In the event the applicant is qualified for employment in a pawnshop under this section and there is no record
                  of a violation of this chapter, the chief of police or his designee shall issue a permit to the applicant, by mail. If
                  it is found that the person is not qualified for a permit and therefore ineligible for employment in a pawnshop,
                  the chief of police or his designee shall notify the person in writing that they are not eligible for employment,
                  the cause of such denial and their right to appeal to the town council.
                  No person who has been convicted or pled guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any crime involving
                  moral turpitude, illegal gambling, or any felonies, or any crime involving theft or fraudulent practices, shall be
                  issued a permit for the five years preceding the date of application. For purposes of the division, a conviction
                  or plea of guilt or nolo contendere entered under the Georgia First Offender Act, O.C.G.A. § 42-8-60 et seq.,
                  shall be ignored; provided, however, that any such offense shall not be ignored where the defendant violated
                  any term of probation imposed by the court granting first offender status or committed another crime and the
                  sentencing court entered an adjudication of guilt as to the crime for which the defendant had previously been
                  sentenced as a first offender.
                  No person shall be issued a permit if it is determined that the person falsified, concealed, or misrepresented
                  any material fact by any device, trick, or scheme while making application to the police department for a
                  pawnshop permit under this section.
                  All permits issued through administrative error can be terminated and seized by the chief of police, his
                  designee, or the town clerk.
                  All permits issued hereunder remain the property of the town and shall be produced for inspection upon the
                  demand of any officer of the town.
                  It shall be the duty of all persons holding a pawnshop occupation tax certificate to file with the chief of police

                  Sec. 38-1. - Purpose and intent.
                  The town is expected to grow in the future, thus the need for a uniform sign ordinance to be instituted for the
                  protection of the town citizens. In addition, various and diverse businesses are located within the town and their
                  need to advertise products and services must be balanced by the town's obligation to restrict clutter, maintain an
                  aesthetically pleasing environment, protect property values, and enhance public safety.
                  Regulation of the location, size, placement, and certain features of signs is necessary to enable the public to locate
                  goods, services and facilities in the town without difficulty and confusion, to improve the general attractiveness of
                  the community, to take advantage of the beauty of the community's natural environment, and to protect property
                  values therein. Such regulation is also necessary to facilitate and aid in the identification and location of businesses
                  in the town in the event of police, fire, or other emergencies and to avoid confusion and delay in response to such
                  emergencies. Accordingly, it is the intention of the town to establish regulations governing the display of signs,
                  which will:
                  Promote and protect the public health, safety and general welfare.
                  Enhance the economy and the business and industry of the town by promoting the reasonable, orderly and
                  effective display of signs.
                  Restrict signs and lights, which increase clutter or which increase the probability of traffic accidents by
                  obstructing vision, or creating excess glare.
                  Promote signs that are compatible with their surroundings.
                  Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.
                  It is also the purpose of this chapter to ensure proper maintenance, for safety and structural soundness, as well as
                  the appearance and attractiveness of signs.

                  Nonconforming signs, which met all legal requirements when erected, may stay in place; provided within 90 days of

                  registration of a nonconforming sign. Nonconforming signs shall be permitted until one of the following conditions
                  occurs:
                  The deterioration of the sign or damage to the sign makes it a hazard or unsightly;
                  The sign has been damaged to the extent that more than minor repairs are required to restore the sign.

                  the sign being registered.
                  No structural repairs, changes in shape, size or design, shall be permitted, except to make a nonconforming sign

                  Sec. 38-58. - Variances.
                  Where a literal application of the terms of this chapter, due to special circumstances, would result in an unusual hardship in an
                  individual case, a variance may be granted where all the following conditions exist:
                  Exceptional conditions pertaining to the property where the sign is to be located as a result of its size, shape,
                  or topography, which are not applicable to other lands or structures in the area.
                  The applicant would be deprived of rights that are commonly enjoyed by others similarly situated.
                  Granting the variance would not confer on the applicant any significant privileges, which are denied to others

                  similarly situated.
                  The exceptional circumstances are not the result of action by the applicant.
                  The requested variance is the minimum variance necessary to allow the applicant to enjoy the rights
                  commonly enjoyed be others similarly situated.
                  Granting of the variance would not violate more than one standard of this chapter.
                  Granting the variance would not result in allowing a sign that interferes with road or highway visibility or
                  obstruct or otherwise interfere with the safe and orderly movement of traffic.

                  permittee for any sign which shows gross neglect or becomes dilapidated. Such due notices shall be in writing, shall
                  specify the sign and location and shall state that the sign has not been properly maintained. The town shall give the
                  permittee ten days to rectify the conditions or remove the dilapidated sign before issuing a citation.
                  The town may issue a citation for violation of this chapter by any sign erected, altered converted, or used in violation
                  of this chapter.

                  In the event a single property owner subscribes to town utility services for more than one property, the delinquency in
                  payment of one account shall be grounds for disconnection of services to all properties of the same owner, regardless of
                  delinquencies, until such time as all of that owner's accounts are paid in full, including late fees, penalties, disconnection charges,

                  schedule; provided, however, that if such special reading discloses that the meter was overread, no charge will be

                  desirable by the town. Bills shall be paid at the town hall.
                  Failure to receive bills or notices shall not prevent such bills from becoming delinquent nor relieve the consumer
                  from payment of same.
                  The failure of water users to timely pay charges duly imposed shall result in the automatic imposition of the
                  following penalties:
                  Nonpayment within 20 days from the due date will be subject to a penalty of ten percent of the delinquent
                  account.
                  Nonpayment within 40 days from the date due will result in the water being shut off from the water user's
                  property.
                  Nonpayment for 60 days after original due date will allow the town, in addition to all other rights and
                  remedies, to terminate service to the property.
                  Sec. 48-114. - Disconnection for nonpayment; reconnection fees.
                  Water service may be discontinued for delinquency in the payment of sums due for water service, garbage
                  collection service, or fire protection services. Service disconnected for nonpayment of bills will be restored only after
                  bills are paid in full, such security deposit or additional security deposit as may be required by the mayor and
                  council is made, and a reconnection fee as provided in the town fee schedule is paid for each meter reconnected.
                  Upon discontinuance of service for nonpayment of bills, in the event reconnection is not requested within a
                  reasonable time, the security deposit will be applied by the town toward settlement of the account. Any balance will
                  be refunded to the consumer; however, if the security deposit is insufficient to cover the bill, the town may proceed
                  to collect the balance in the usual way provided by law for collection of debts.
                  Sec. 48-115. - Disconnection of service for reasons other than nonpayment.
                  The town reserves a right to discontinue its service without notice for the following additional reasons:
                  To prevent fraud or abuse;
                  Consumer's willful disregard of the town's rules;
                  Emergency repairs;

                  service location, subject to any required minimum increase in the event the amount on deposit is a preexisting
                  amount prior to the enactment of this section or the deposit, in the town's discretion, is not sufficient to ensure
                  payment to the town for the services provided.
                  Refunds will be made by applying the deposit to the customer's account. In the event of final billing for discontinued

                  supersede the prior official zoning map. The new official zoning map may correct drafting or other errors or
                  omissions in the prior official zoning map, but no such correction shall have the effect of amending the original
                  official zoning map or any subsequent amendment thereof. The new official zoning map shall be identified by the
                  signature of the mayor, attested by the town clerk, and bear the seal of the town or a notary public under the

                  limit line shall be construed to be such boundaries.
                  Where boundaries are indicated as approximately following property lines or such lines extended, as indicated by

                  Sec. 52-56. - Purpose and intent.
                  Within the districts established by this chapter, there exist certain incompatible lots, buildings, structures, signs and
                  uses of land which were lawful before these regulations were adopted but which would be prohibited, regulated or
                  restricted under the terms of these regulations or future amendments.
                  It is the intention of this article to permit these nonconformities to continue, but not to encourage them.
                  Nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for variances or for
                  adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.

                  In any district, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of these regulations, a single-family dwelling and
                  customary accessory buildings or any other permitted use may be erected on any single lot of record existing at the effective date
                  of adoption or amendment of these regulations, even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both,
                  applicable to the particular district involved, provided that yard dimensions and other requirements of the lot shall conform to the
                  regulations for the district in which the lot is located.

                  this chapter is derived may be continued, subject to the limitations of section 52-59, even though such use does not
                  conform with the provisions of these regulations, except that the use of a principal building, structure or land
                  containing a nonconforming use shall not be:
                  Changed to another nonconforming use;
                  Reestablished after discontinuance or abandonment for six months;
                  Expanded, enlarged or extended, unless such use is changed to a use permitted in the district in which such
                  use if located; rebuilt, altered or repaired after damage exceeding 50 percent of its replacement cost at the
                  time of destruction as determined by the building official and provided such rebuilding, alteration or repair is
                  completed with one year of such damage;
                  Moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot occupied by such use, except in conformity with these
                  regulations.
                  Nothing in this article shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition any building,
                  structure, or portion thereof declared to be unsafe by an official charged with protecting the public safety or health,
                  upon order of such official.

                  additions meet the applicable building setbacks and all other regulations for the district in which they are located. This section shall
                  not, however, be construed as to authorize the expansion of a nonconforming building for a use which is not permitted by the

                  The town council shall serve as the board of zoning appeals. Four members present shall be required to constitute a
                  quorum. One such member shall be annually elected chairperson by the members of the board of zoning appeals,
                  or in lieu of such election, the mayor shall preside over such meetings. The chairperson shall not vote except in
                  cases of a tie vote between the other members. In cases of a tie vote and the chairperson excuses himself from

                  The board of zoning appeals shall meet at least one time each month at the call of the chairperson, or at such other

                  however, that if no regular business is scheduled, no meeting is required. Meetings of the board of zoning appeals

                  take place separate from such regular meeting and shall be adjourned or convened before or after such regular
                  meeting.
                  The board shall adopt rules for the transaction of business, or in lieu of such rules, the board shall keep a record of

                  Sec. 52-276. - Determination of district boundaries.
                  The board of zoning appeals shall have original jurisdiction to, upon application, determine the location of a particular district
                  boundary in question as specified in section 52-24.

                  Sec. 52-277. - Variances.
                  The board of zoning appeals is hereby empowered to authorize upon application in specific cases such variance
                  from the terms of these regulations as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions,
                  a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary
                  hardship, so that the spirit of these regulations shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial
                  justice done.
                  The existence of a nonconforming use of neighboring land, buildings or structures in the same zoning district or of
                  permitted or nonconforming uses in other districts shall not constitute a reason for the requested variance. A
                  variance may be granted in an individual case of unnecessary hardship, after appropriate application in accordance
                  with article XII of this chapter, upon specific findings that all of the following conditions exist. The absence of any
                  one of the conditions shall be grounds for denial of the application for variance.
                  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question
                  because of its size, shape or topography that are not applicable to other land or structures in the same district;
                  A literal interpretation of the provisions of these zoning regulations would create an unnecessary hardship and
                  would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other property owners within the district in which
                  the property is located;
                  Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the property of the applicant any special privileges that
                  are denied to other properties of the district in which the applicant's property is located;
                  Relief, if granted, will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of these regulations and will not be injurious
                  to the neighborhood or general welfare in such a manner as will interfere with or discourage the appropriate
                  development and use of adjacent land and buildings or unreasonably affect their value;
                  The special circumstances are not the result of the actions of the applicant;
                  The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the land, building, or
                  structure; and
                  The variance is not a request to permit a use of land, buildings or structures which is not permitted by right in
                  the district involved.

                  In exercising its powers, the board of zoning appeals may, in conformity with the provisions of these regulations,
                  reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination, and to that
                  end shall have all of the powers of the zoning administrator and building official and may issue or direct the
                  issuance of a permit. The concurring vote of four members of the board shall be necessary to reverse any order,
                  requirement, decision or determination of the zoning administrator, building official, or town engineer.

                  than six months unless such use is established within such period; provided, however, that such order by the board shall continue
                  in force and effect if a building permit for said erection or alteration is obtained within such period, and such erection or alteration
                  is started and proceeds to completion in accordance with such permit.

                  to the text of the zoning regulations or the official zoning map, except that if a zoning decision of the town council is
