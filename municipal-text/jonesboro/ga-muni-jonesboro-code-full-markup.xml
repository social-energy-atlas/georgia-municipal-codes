PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Jonesboro, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1987 Code, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1987 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Palmer Carr, Supervising Editor, and Robert McNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to the Honorable Joy Day, Mayor, Ms. Katherine Smith, City Clerk, and Mr. Steven Fincher, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  (a)  The city as adopted below establishes protest procedures to handle and resolve disputes relating to their procurements and shall in all instances disclose information regarding the protest to the awarding agency. A protestor must exhaust all administrative remedies with the city. 
                  (b)  If an interested bidder or proposal submitting party protests the award of a bid or proposal the party shall submit such protest in writing within 30 days of the award of the bid or proposal to the city clerk. 
                  (c)  The protest must specify what violation of this division occurred and the factual basis for the allegation. The grounds for a protest shall be limited to allegations of factual error or that the bid or proposal was not accepted for personal, political, racial, or religious reasons. 
                  (d)  The protest must be issued by the party under oath or affirmation. 
                  (e)  Within 60 days of the protest the procurement board shall determine if the protest complies with this division. If the protest does not comply the parties will be notified in writing and provided a recitation of deficiencies. The party may then resubmit a protest. All protest resubmittals must comply with the time limit set forth in subsection (b). 
                  (f)  Once a complete protest is submitted the mayor and council shall convene an administrative hearing of a procurement board of three city citizens who have resided in the city for at least six months. 
                  (g)  A protest hearing is a quasi-judicial proceeding. As such, it should be conducted at a place conducive to the maintenance of a judicial atmosphere. At the hearing, the conduct of the parties shall be dignified, both on and off the record. 
                  (h)  Misconduct before the procurement board may be grounds for summary exclusion from the hearing. The hearing is intended to receive evidence either to refute or to substantiate specific charges which led to the protest. It shall not be a forum for discussion of extraneous or irrelevant matters having no bearing on the charges. All parties at action and witnesses shall be given ample time and opportunity to develop points, subject to the discretion of the procurement board. 
                  (i)  The procurement board shall not be advocates for or against either party. The procurement board may be appointed independent council for the purposes of investigating and/or refusing the protest. It shall be the duty of the procurement board to be impartial in its conduct and rulings, both on and off the record. The protestors and mayor and council may examine, call and question witnesses and may call for and introduce appropriate documentary evidence, being limited only by the relevance of the evidence to the issues. 
                  (j)  It should be recognized that the procurement board may be composed of private citizens. Accordingly, the board may not follow established legal procedures as might be expected in a court of law. However, in taking testimony and in considering the evidence, the board shall follow accepted legal procedure insofar as is practicable. It shall not be bound by the technical rules of evidence observed in courts of law. The board may listen to hearsay testimony and may accept depositions and affidavits, if such testimony is material and relevant to the issues. 
                  (k)  Each protest shall be heard by the board at the earliest practicable date following the receipt of a compliant protest. 
                  (l)  The city clerk shall send out a written notice of the time, date and place of the hearing. This notice shall be sent to the protestor and/or his authorized representative. 
                  (m)  The general policy of the board concerning postponements shall be that cases set for hearings will be heard on the dates set, and that postponements will be granted only for good cause. Postponement of the opening date of a hearing shall be at the discretion of the chairman of the board. 
                  (n)  If deemed appropriate to the circumstances of the case, protestor or board may arrange a prehearing conference prior to the hearing in order to consider and determine the following elements: 
                  (1)  Simplification of the issues. 
                  (2)  Possible conciliation and settlement without a hearing. 
                  (3)  Limitation on the number of witnesses. 
                  (4)  Acceptance of evidence of deposition. 
                  (5)  Stipulation as to any uncontested facts. 
                  (6)  Other matters that may aid in the disposition of the appeal. 
                  (o)  An electronic recording of transactions may be made during prehearing conferences upon request of either party at interest. 
                  (p)  The chairman of the board shall administer the oath to witnesses. In the event that a prehearing conference has not limited the number of witnesses and the number of witnesses asked for seems to be excessive, in the discretion of the board the party requesting them may be required to justify his request before the board. The board may decline to listen to numbers of witnesses testifying to identical facts. The board, through the city clerk, may subpoena witnesses, documents and records as necessary. 
                  (q)  A protestor appearing before the procurement board may, if desired, be represented by legal counsel at their expense, or they may act as their own counsel and conduct their own hearings. 
                  (r)  A certified court reporter may, if desired, be employed by either party at interest, at their expense. 
                  (s)  The protestor shall make the initial presentation in an effort to prove that the award was taken for personal, religious, racial, or political reasons or that the decision was based upon factual error. After the presentation of all evidence, the procurement board may hear closing arguments and shall then take the case under advisement and render a decision at the earliest practicable date. 
                  (t)  The procurement board and mayor and council may reverse the award only on a finding that it was based on error or fact or was motivated by personal, religious, racial, or political reasons. Otherwise it shall affirm the decision. 
                  (u)  The procurement board, after reaching a decision in the case, shall cause an order to be prepared, setting forth their decision and directing appropriate remedies, if any, to resolve the appeal. Except as provided below, the decision of the procurement board in such cases shall be final and conclusive, in the absence of an appellant review. Copies of the board order shall be made a matter of official record and shall be furnished to all parties at interest.

                  Sec. 2-185. - Competition. 
                  (a)  All procurement transactions will be conducted in a manner providing full and open competition. Some of the situations considered to be restrictive to competition include but are not limited to: 
                  (1)  Placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to qualify to do business. 
                  (2)  Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive bonding. 
                  (3)  Specifying only a brand name product instead of allowing an equal product to be offered. 
                  (b)  All bid or request for proposal documents will incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured. Such description shall not, in competitive procurements, contain features which unduly restrict competition. The description may include a statement of the qualitative nature of the material, product or service to be procured, and when necessary, shall set forth those minimum essential characteristics and standards to which it must conform if it is to satisfy its intended use. 
                  (Ord. of 11-13-2000, § 1(3-3-5)) 
                  Sec. 2-186. - Methods of procurement. 
                  (a)  Small purchase procedures are those relatively simple and informal procurement methods for securing services, supplies, or other property that do not cost more than the simplified acquisition threshold fixed at $1,000.00. If small purchase procedures are used, price or rate quotations shall be obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources. 
                  (b)  Procurement by sealed bids (formal advertising) are bids publicly solicited and a firm fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit price) is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with all the material terms and conditions of the invitation for bids, is the lowest in price. The sealed bid method is the preferred method for procuring construction. In order for sealed bidding to be used, the following conditions should be present: 
                  (1)  A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase description is available; 
                  (2)  Two or more responsible bidders are willing and able to compete effectively for the business; 
                  (3)  The procurement lends itself to a firm fixed contract and the selection of the successful bidder can be made principally on the basis of price; and 
                  (4)  If sealed bids are used, the following requirements apply: 
                  a.  The invitation for bids will be publicly advertised and bids shall be solicited from an adequate number of known suppliers, providing them sufficient time prior to the date set for opening the bids; 
                  b.  The invitation for bids, which will include any specifications and pertinent attachments, shall define the items or services in order for the bidder to properly respond; 
                  c.  All bids will be publicly opened at the time and place prescribed in the invitation for bids; 
                  d.  A firm fixed-price contract award will be made in writing to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder. Where specified in bidding documents, factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and life cycle costs shall be considered in determining which bid is lowest. Payment discounts will only be used to determine the low bid when prior experience indicates that such discounts are usually taken advantage of; and 
                  e.  Any or all bids may be rejected whether such right is reserved in public notice or not and in such case the city may readvertise or abandon the project. 
                  (c)  Procurement by competitive proposals. The technique of competitive proposals is normally conducted with more than one source submitting an offer, and either a fixed-price or cost-reimbursement type contract is awarded. It is generally used when conditions are not appropriate for the use of sealed bids. If this method is used, the following requirements apply: 
                  (1)  Requests for proposals will be publicized and identify all evaluation factors and their relative importance. Any response to publicized requests for proposals shall be honored to the maximum extent practical; and 
                  (2)  Proposals will be solicited from an adequate number of qualified sources. 
                  (d)  Awards will be made to the responsible firm whose proposal is most advantageous to the program, with price and other factors considered. 
                  (e)  The city may use competitive proposal procedures for qualifications-based procurement of architectural/engineering (A/E) profession services whereby competitors' qualifications are evaluated and the most qualified competitor is selected, subject to negotiation of fair and reasonable compensation. 
                  (f)  Procurement by noncompetitive proposals may be used only when the award of a contract is infeasible under small purchase procedures, sealed bids or competitive proposals and one of the following circumstances applies: 
                  (1)  The item is available only from a single source; 
                  (2)  After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate; and 
                  (3)  Cost analysis, i.e., verifying the proposed cost data, the projections of the data, and the evaluation of the specific elements of costs and profits, is required.

                  Sec. 2-187. - Small and minority firms. 
                  The city will take all necessary affirmative steps to assure that minority firms, small firms, women's business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms are used when possible. 
                  (Ord. of 11-13-2000, § 1(3-3-7)) 
                  Sec. 2-188. - Price analysis. 
                  The city shall perform a cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement action including contract modifications. The method and degree of analysis is dependent on the facts surrounding the particular procurement situation, but as a starting point, the city will make independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals. A cost analysis must be performed when the offeror is required to submit the elements of his estimated cost, e.g., under professional consulting, and architectural engineering services contracts. A cost analysis will be necessary when adequate price competition is lacking and for sole source procurements, including contract modifications or change orders, established on the basis of a catalog or market price of a commercial product sold in substantial quantities to the general public or based on prices set by law or regulation.

                  Sec. 2-190. - Failure to comply. 
                  Failure of an offeror, bidder, proposer or submittor to comply with this division may result in loss of award and may subject the party to actions against applicable bonds or other actions.

                  (a)  An official of the city shall disclose the nature of any interest or benefit he or she has at the time such matter is presented to the mayor and council for discussion and/or action.

                  The mayor and the Jonesboro City Council finds and declares as follows: 
                  (1)  In 2007, the U.S. Surgeon General issued a report entitled "The Surgeon General's Call to Action to Prevent and Reduce Underage Drinking," which can be found at http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/topics/underagedrinking/calltoaction.pdf. ("Surgeon General's Call to Action"). 
                  (2)  "Early alcohol consumption by some young people will result in an alcohol use disorder—that is, they will meet diagnostic criteria for either alcohol abuse or dependence." Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page 4. 
                  (3)  "[A] higher percentage of youth in 8th, 10th, and 12th grades used alcohol in the month prior to being surveyed than used tobacco or marijuana, the illicit drug most commonly used by adolescents." Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page 5. 
                  (4)  Various surveys have found that: approximately ten percent of children who are nine to ten years old have started drinking alcoholic beverages; nearly 33 percent of youth start drinking alcoholic beverages before the age of 13; more than ten percent of youth who are 12 to 13 years old; and over 33 percent of youth who are 14 to 15 years old reported drinking a whole alcoholic beverage in the year before they were surveyed and the peak years of alcohol initiation are when youth are in 7th and 8th grades. Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page 6. 
                  (5)  While adolescents typically drink alcoholic beverages less often than adults, when they do drink alcoholic beverages, adolescents tend to drink more alcoholic beverages at each event than adults. Surgeon General's Call to Action, at pages 6-7. 
                  (6)  Persons who are less than the age of 21 often possess or consume alcoholic beverages at social parties or gatherings held at or on private residences and other private property under control of a person who either has provided the alcoholic beverages or who knows or reasonably should know of such conduct, but fails to take steps to prevent it. 
                  (7)  "Annually, about 5,000 people under age 21 die from alcohol-related injuries involving underage drinking." Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page 10. 
                  (8)  Underage drinking "[p]lays a significant role in risky sexual behavior, including unwanted, unintended, and unprotected sexual activity, and sex with multiple partners. Such behavior increases the risk of unplanned pregnancy and of contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS." Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page 10. 
                  (9)  Underage drinking "[i]ncreases the risk of physical and sexual assault." Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page 10. 
                  (10)  Underage drinking "[c]an cause a range of physical consequences, from hangovers to death from alcohol poisoning." Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page 11. 
                  (11)  Underage drinking "[c]an cause alterations in the structure and function of the developing brain, which continues to mature into the mid-to-late twenties and may have consequences reaching far beyond adolescence." Surgeon General's Call to Action, at page 11. 
                  (12)  Underage drinking "[c]reates secondhand effects that can put others at risk. Loud and unruly behavior, property destruction, unintentional injuries, violence, and even death because of underage alcohol use afflict innocent parties. For instance, about 45 percent of people who die in car crashes involving a drinking driver under the age of 21 are people other than the driver." Surgeon General's Call to Action. at page 11. 
                  (13)  Law enforcement agency responses to disturbances involving underage consumption of alcoholic beverages at gatherings at or on dwelling units, private residences or other private property frequently require the use of extensive public resources. Further, when law enforcement personnel respond to such disturbances it limits their ability to respond to other service calls in the community, thereby placing the community at increased risk. Law enforcement is not currently reimbursed for their expenses when called to a gathering at or on a dwelling unit, private residence or other private property. 
                  (14)  The prohibitions found in this article are reasonable and expected to deter the possession and consumption of alcoholic beverages by persons under the age of 21 by holding responsible persons who encourage, are aware of, or should be aware of, the illegal conduct, yet fail to take steps to prevent it. In addition, the revenue received by the city, after cost reimbursement to the responding law enforcement agency, will be directed toward law enforcement strategies and prevention programs in the city.

                  Sec. 10-31. - Purpose. 
                  Based on city officials' own observations of establishments that exploit live human nudity and human sexuality for commercial profit, euphemistically referred to as adult entertainment, and the experiences of other urban cities and counties including, but not limited to, Austin, Texas; Manatee County, Florida; the State of Minnesota; Indianapolis, Indiana; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and Phoenix, Arizona, and as further described in City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 120 S. Ct. 1382 (2000), which experiences are relevant to the problems faced by the City of Jonesboro, Georgia, and based on the evidence and testimony of persons who have appeared before the mayor and council, the mayor and council take note of the well-known and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of live human nudity and human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within the country. 
                  Moreover, it is the finding of the mayor and council that the commercial exploitation of live human nudity and human sexuality, in all the forms in which such exploitation may be manifested has deleterious effects on the community where it takes place and that such effects are intensified and exacerbated when adult entertainment is provided in conjunction with the service or consumption of alcohol. The mayor and council find that adult entertainment causes an increase in criminal behavior in nearby areas, including, but not limited to, disorderly conduct, public intoxication, prostitution, solicitation, drug trafficking, drug use and corruption of public officials. The mayor and council further find that adult entertainment establishments escalate undesirable community conditions, including blight, diminish property values, increase the need for law enforcement and emergency medical response resources, and increase the burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described. 
                  The mayor and council expressly find that the negative effects of adult entertainment are not limited to adult entertainment that offers live or recorded performances with human nudity or the depiction of sexual acts. Other forms of adult entertainment also have a deleterious effect upon the quality of life in nearby neighborhoods and commercial districts and on urban life in general. Such other forms of adult entertainment include, but are not limited to, adult bookstores, peep shows, adult theaters, massage parlors, bath houses, adult gift or novelty shops, and lingerie modeling studios. 
                  Further, based on the investigation conducted by the city regarding lingerie modeling studios, it is the finding of the mayor and council that lingerie modeling studios are establishments that offer adult entertainment in the form of live human nudity in a private setting. Based on the evidence presented to the mayor and council, it is apparent that lingerie modeling studios, by providing adult entertainment in a private setting, lead to criminal behavior including, but not limited to, masturbation for hire, prostitution, and sodomy. 
                  Furthermore, based on the investigation conducted by the city, it is apparent that lingerie modeling studios pose a more difficult challenge to the enforcement of regulations pertaining to adult entertainment business, in that the activity occurs within a private setting, as opposed to in an open area which is visible to all patrons of the establishment. For the same reason, the mayor and council have identified massage parlors as presenting similar risks of criminal behavior and problems of enforcement. The mayor and council have determined that lighting, visibility and access are measures that can reduce the risk of crime to patrons and others. 
                  Accordingly, the mayor and council find that it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community to limit and regulate adult entertainment within the corporate boundaries of the city, so as to limit the adverse impact on property values, other business uses, residential uses and public and semi-public uses; to ensure that adult entertainment uses and adult entertainment facilities do not impede development, redevelopment and neighborhood revitalization efforts; to restrict adult entertainment and adult uses in heavily-used public pedestrian areas and to protect patrons of adult entertainment business from unreasonable risk of crime. 
                  After giving due consideration to the considerations stated in these findings and the current state of growth and development of the city, the mayor and council find that properties located within the city limits and abutting the right of way of Tara Boulevard are so situated as to provide sufficient vehicular access to patrons and suppliers, while providing the desired containment from residential uses and pedestrian traffic, regarding adult entertainment facilities and adult entertainment businesses. 
                  This article is not intended as a de facto prohibition of legally-protected forms of expression. This article is intended to represent a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of neighborhoods and development through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus any legally protected rights of providers and patrons of adult entertainment. 
                  It is a matter of governmental interest and concern and in the interest of the public welfare to minimize the proliferation of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments that commercially exploit human sexuality through adult entertainment to limit adult entertainment uses of property to certain prescribed areas of the city. To that end, this article is hereby adopted.

                  It shall be unlawful for any person, association, partnership, or corporation to operate, engage in, conduct, or carry on, in or upon any premises within the incorporated area of the city an adult entertainment establishment as defined in this article without first procuring an annual license to do so except as provided in subsection 10-42(b) when the mayor or his/her designee fails to approve or deny an application for an adult entertainment license within 30 days as required by this article. The issuance of such an annual license shall not be deemed to authorize condone or make legal any activity thereunder if the same is deemed illegal or unlawful under the laws of the state or the United States. No annual license for an adult entertainment establishment shall be issued by the city if the premises to be used also holds a license to sell alcoholic beverages or malt beverages and wine for consumption on the premises. Any premises licensed as an adult entertainment establishment shall not be eligible to apply at any time for a license to sell alcoholic beverages or malt beverages and wine for consumption on the premises. There shall be an annual regulatory fee for each adult entertainment establishment licensed within the city in the amount of $5,000.00, to be used for the costs of administration and enforcement of this article. The annual regulatory fee must be paid to the city within ten days after the mayor or his/her designee approves the initial application for an adult entertainment establishment license or a renewal thereof. In any event, no adult entertainment establishment license or renewal thereof shall be issued until the most recent annual regulatory fee has been paid. All licenses granted hereunder shall expire on December 31 of each year. Licensees who desire to renew their license shall file an application with the city on the form provided for renewal of the license for the ensuing year. Applications for renewal must be filed before November 30 of each year. Any renewal application received after November 30 shall pay, in addition to said annual regulatory fee, a late charge of ten percent. If a license renewal application is received after January 1, such application shall be treated as an initial application and the applicant shall be required to comply with all rules and regulations for the granting of licenses as if no previous license had been held. If a license application is received after January 1, investigative and administrative costs as hereinafter set forth in this article will be assessed. All licenses granted hereunder shall be for the calendar year and the full annual regulatory fee must be paid for a license renewal application filed prior to July 1 of the license year.

For the purposes of this article, "poultry" shall mean any domesticated bird, including but not limited to, chickens (including roosters), ducks, geese, guineas, quail, pigeons and turkeys. 
                  (2)  Housing types allowed to keep poultry; adult residents deemed keepers or owners.

                  (3)  Personal use only. The keeping of poultry pursuant to this chapter is for non-commercial, personal use only. 
                  (4)  Poultry enclosed. Each keeper of poultry is required to have an accessory structure and/or fenced area to house and control said poultry. Such accessory structures shall meet all requirements for accessory structures set out in the zoning ordinance, including those for setbacks and location. Poultry shall be kept only in the rear or side yard and must be within a fenced area. No poultry shall roam free. 
                  (5)  Nuisance prohibited. The keeping of poultry authorized under this chapter shall not create a nuisance as defined by the Jonesboro City Code. The keeping of poultry shall be conducted in a manner that does not disturb the use or enjoyment of adjacent properties.

The building official may revoke a permit upon determination by the building official that the construction, erection, alteration, repair, moving, demolition, installation or replacement of the building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical, or plumbing systems for which the permit was issued is in violation of, or not in conformity with, the provisions of the construction codes. 
                  (e)  Unsafe buildings or systems.

                  (g)  Alternate materials and methods. The provisions of the construction codes are not intended to prevent the use of any material or method of construction not specifically prescribed by them, provided any such alternate has been reviewed by the building official. The building official shall approve any such alternate provided the building official finds that the alternate for the purpose intended is at least the equivalent of that prescribed in the construction codes, in quality, strength, effectiveness, fire resistance, durability, and safety. The building official shall require that sufficient evidence or proof be submitted to substantiate any claim made regarding the alternate.

A permit shall not be issued to an owner, who is neither a licensed contractor nor the occupant of a residential structure being altered. 
                  (2)  Work authorized.

The execution shall assert and be a lien against the property from the day of the completion of the performance of the work hereinbefore described and shall bear interest at the rate of one percent per month from the date on which it is issued.

Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction.

The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and the city are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials.

It shall be the duty of the tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem tax, including specifically Chapter 4 of Title 48 of the O.C.G.A.; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the city. Thirty days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. 
                  (i)  The tax commissioner shall collect and retain an amount equal to the cost of administering a lien authorized by O.C.G.A. § 41-2-7 et seq. unless such costs are waived by resolution of Clayton County. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of administering the lien. 
                  (j)  The city may waive and release any such lien imposed on property on the owner of such property entering into a contract with the county or city agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property of the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
                  (k)  Where the abatement action does not commence in the Clayton County Superior Court, review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the Clayton County Superior Court as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29. 
                  (l)  The public officers designated herein may issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted by ordinance, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and may seek to enforce such citation in any court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this article. 
                  (m)  Nothing in this article shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise.

                  (b)  The execution shall be levied by the chief of police of the city upon property of the defendant located in the jurisdiction, and sufficient property shall be advertised and sold to pay the amount of the execution, with interest and costs.

If, at any time after the entry of nulla bona has been made, the person against whom the execution issues pays the tax in full together with all interest and costs accrued on the tax, the person may collect any fees and charges due him as though he had never defaulted in the payment of the taxes.

The economic conditions from 2009 until 2016 have driven many businesses from the proposed enterprise zone and a considerable portion of the buildings in the proposed enterprise zone are vacant, underutilized, or dilapidated.

                  (3)  The proposed enterprise zone shows block groups with poverty rates less than 14 percent, between 15 percent and 29 percent, and greater than 29 percent poverty.

                  (b)  Where this section requires compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in sections 34-34(b) and (c) of this article, the city shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements as if a permit had been issued and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders. 
                  (Ord. No. 2018-004B , § 1, 3-12-2018) 
                  Sec. 34-34. - Minimum requirements for erosion and sedimentation control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not excluded by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation, and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation, and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of sections 34-34(b) and (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sedimentation pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this ordinance and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in sections 34-34(b) and (c) of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 subsection (b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by the city or by the division or of any state general permit for construction activities issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or by the division or any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15)—(17) below, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation, pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 34-34(b)(2) of this article; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraphs (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral, stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water, and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetative in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetation cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (17)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this O.C.G.A., the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph, "maintenance" shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. "Maintenance" does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and "serviceable" shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented; 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this act and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented; and 
                  d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in Ga. Reg. § 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent an issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in sections 34-34(b) and (c) of this article. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

                  (b)  Stop-work orders. 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the city shall issue a written warning to the violator.

If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the city shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or city shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or city shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and

The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 34-35(b)(5)b. The city may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this article, the rules and regulations adopted pursuant hereto, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day.

The suspension, revocation, modification or grant with condition of a permit by the city upon finding that the holder is not in compliance with the approved erosion, sediment and pollution control plan; or that the holder is in violation of permit conditions; or that the holder is in violation of any ordinance; shall entitle the person submitting the plan or holding the permit to a hearing before the city director within 15 days after receipt by the city of written notice of appeal.

                  (b)  For each site on which land-disturbing activity occurs, each entity or person acting as either a primary, secondary, or tertiary permittee, as defined in the state general permit, shall have as a minimum one person who is in responsible charge of erosion and sedimentation control activities on behalf of said entity or person and meets the applicable education or training certification requirements developed by the commission present on site whenever land-disturbing activities are conducted on that site. A project site shall herein be defined as any land-disturbance site or multiple sites within a larger common plan of development or sale permitted by an owner or operator for compliance with the state general permit.

                  (2)  The fact that a land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (3)  No provision of this article shall permit any persons to violate the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act or the rules and regulations promulgated and approved thereunder or pollute any waters of the state as defined thereby.

                  DIVISION 1. - TITLE, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND GENERAL PROVISIONS 

                  Sec. 34-200. - Title. 
                  This article shall be known as the City of Jonesboro's "Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance." 
                  (Ord. No. 2014-011, § 1, 12-8-2014) 
                  Sec. 34-201. - Findings of fact. 
                  It is hereby determined that: 
                  (1)  The flood hazard areas of the City of Jonesboro are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
                  (2)  Flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas. 
                  (3)  Effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can: (1) Protect human life and health; (2) Minimize damage to private property; (3) Minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; and (4) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public. 
                  (4)  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and The Municipal Home Rule Act of 1965, O.C.G.A. §§ 36-35-1 to -8, have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City of Jonesboro does ordain this ordinance and establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction provisions for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. 
                  It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property. 
                  (Ord. No. 2014-011, § 1, 12-8-2014) 
                  Sec. 34-201.1. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, streambank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation, and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; and 
                  (6)  Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation, and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas.

The market value of the building means (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been identified by the code enforcement official. The term does also not include any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure.

                  (b)  Prohibition of illegal connections. The construction, connection, use, maintenance or continued existence of any illegal connection to the city's separate storm sewer system is prohibited. 
                  (1)  This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illegal connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of the connection. 
                  (2)  A person violates this article if the person connects a line conveying sewage to the city's separate storm sewer system, or allows such a connection to continue. 
                  (3)  Improper connections in violation of this article must be disconnected and redirected, if necessary, to an approved onsite wastewater management system or the sanitary sewer system upon approval of the Jonesboro Sanitation Department. 
                  (4)  Any drain or conveyance that has not been documented in plans, maps or equivalent, and which may be connected to the storm sewer system, shall be located by the owner or occupant of that property upon receipt of written notice of violation from the authorized enforcement agency requiring that such locating be completed. Such notice will specify a reasonable time period within which the location of the drain or conveyance is to be completed, that the drain or conveyance be identified as storm sewer, sanitary sewer or other, and that the outfall location or point of connection to the storm sewer system, sanitary sewer system or other discharge point be identified. Results of these investigations are to be documented and provided to the authorized enforcement agency. 
                  Sec. 34-254. - Suspension of access to the city's separate storm sewer system 
                  (a)  Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The authorized enforcement agency may, without prior notice, suspend the city's separate storm sewer system discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the city's separate storm sewer system or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the city's separate storm sewer system, state waters or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons. 
                  (b)  Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the city's separate storm sewer system in violation of this article may have their city's separate storm sewer system access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its city's separate storm sewer system access. The violator may petition the authorized enforcement agency for a reconsideration and hearing. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates without the prior approval of the authorized enforcement agency, city's separate storm sewer system access to premises terminated pursuant to this section. 
                  Sec. 34-255. - Industrial or construction activity discharges. 
                  Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater discharge permit shall comply with the provisions of such permit.

                  (b)  Access to facilities. 
                  (1)  The authorized enforcement agency shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities at reasonable times subject to regulation under this article as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this article. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency. 
                  (2)  Facility owners or operators shall allow the authorized enforcement agency ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, photographing, videotaping, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law. 
                  (3)  The authorized enforcement agency shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge. 
                  (4)  The authorized enforcement agency has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary and make the monitoring data available to the authorized enforcement agency at the owner or operator's own expense. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
                  (5)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the property or facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the authorized enforcement agency and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the owner or operator. 
                  (6)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the authorized enforcement agency access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this article. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this article. 
                  (7)  If the authorized enforcement agency has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.

                  The authorized enforcement agency will adopt requirements identifying best management practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system, state waters or waters of the United States. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the city's separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliant with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.

                  ARTICLE VII. - POST-DEVELOPMENT STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT 

                  Sec. 34-301. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. It is hereby determined that: 
                  (1)  Land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition; 
                  (2)  Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
                  (3)  The impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
                  (4)  These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment, by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or "credits". The Georgia Greenspace Program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits; 
                  (5)  Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution; and 
                  (6)  Therefore, the City of Jonesboro has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of post-development stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate post-development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with post-development stormwater runoff. 
                  (b)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
                  (1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
                  (2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
                  (3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
                  (4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
                  (5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the county's greenspace protection plan; 
                  (6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and 
                  (7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up.

                  Sec. 34-311. - Post-development stormwater management performance criteria. 
                  The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this article: 
                  (1)  Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
                  a.  It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; 
                  b.  Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and 
                  c.  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the city and/or its designee are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
                  (2)  Stream channel protection. 
                  a.  Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches: 
                  1.  Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer; 
                  2.  Twenty-four-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event; and 
                  3.  Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control. 
                  b.  This requirement is waived for sites that discharge directly into larger streams, rivers, wetlands, or lakes, or to a man-made channel or conveyance system where the reduction in these flows will not have an impact on upstream or downstream streambank or channel integrity. 
                  (3)  Overbank flooding protection. 
                  a.  Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, 24-hour storm under subsection (2) is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided. 
                  b.  This requirement is waived for sites where the post-development downstream analysis shows that uncontrolled post-development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions. 
                  (4)  Extreme flooding protection. 
                  a.  Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. 
                  b.  This requirement may be adjusted or waived for sites where the post-development downstream analysis shows that uncontrolled post-development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions. 
                  (5)  Structural stormwater controls. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the city and/or its designee before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the city and/or its designee may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. 
                  Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
                  (6)  Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures. The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under subsection (1) herein. The applicant may, if approved by the city and/or its designee, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
                  (7)  Drainage system guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutter, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public rights-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public rights-of-way. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff from more that one parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following requirements: 
                  a.  Methods to calculate stormwater flows shall be in accordance with the stormwater design manual; 
                  b.  All culverts, pipe systems and open channel flow systems shall be sized in accordance with the stormwater management plan using the methods included in the stormwater design manual; and 
                  c.  Design and construction of stormwater conveyance facilities shall be in accordance with the criteria and specifications found in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
                  (8)  Dam design guidelines. Any land-disturbing activity that involves a site which proposes a dam shall comply with the Georgia Safe Dams Act and Rules for Dam Safety as applicable.

                  (a)  The stormwater management plan for each land development project shall provide for stormwater management measures located on the site of the project, unless provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site or regional facility. The off-site or regional facility must be located on property legally dedicated for the purpose, must be designed and adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater quantity and quality control that is equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices and there must be a legally-obligated entity responsible for long-term operation and maintenance of the off-site or regional stormwater facility. In addition, on-site measures shall be implemented, where necessary, to protect upstream and downstream properties and drainage channels from the site to the off-site facility. 
                  (b)  A stormwater management plan must be submitted to the city and/or its designee which shows the adequacy of the off-site or regional facility. 
                  (c)  To be eligible for a modification, the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city and/or its designee that the use of an off-site or regional facility will not result in the following impacts to upstream or downstream areas: 
                  (1)  Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, and property; 
                  (2)  Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other structures; 
                  (3)  Accelerated streambank or streambed erosion or siltation; 
                  (4)  Degradation of in-stream biological functions or habitat; or 
                  (5)  Water quality impairment in violation of state water quality standards, and/or violation of any state or federal regulations.

                  Variances from the above buffer and setback requirements may be granted in accordance with the following provisions: 
                  (1)  Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of this article, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this article, and the city clerk finds and determines that the requirements of this article prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the City Council of the City of Jonesboro may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance require mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel. 
                  (2)  Except as provided above, the City Council of the City of Jonesboro shall grant no variance from any provision of this article without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the city council.

                  Variances will be considered only in the following cases: 
                  a.  When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of this article prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted. 
                  b.  Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in the ordinance would create an extreme hardship. 
                  Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this article, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property. 
                  (3)  At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information: 
                  a.  A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey; 
                  b.  A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
                  c.  A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated;

                  e.  At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible; 
                  f.  A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion; 
                  g.  A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and, 
                  h.  Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed. 
                  (4)  The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance: 
                  a.  The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
                  b.  The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries; 
                  c.  The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; and, 
                  d.  Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion; 
                  e.  The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance; 
                  f.  Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment.

                  --- (7) --- 
                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 2006-02, adopted March 13, 2006, set out provisions intended for use as Art. V, §§ 34-250—34-261. Inasmuch as there were already provisions so designated, these provisions have been redesignated as Art. IX, §§ 34-361—34-372, at the direction of the city. 

                  Sec. 34-361. - Findings. 
                  The Jonesboro City Council makes the following findings: 
                  (1)  Stormwater management is needed throughout the City of Jonesboro. While specific service and system demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the City of Jonesboro is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
                  (2)  Addressing the stormwater management needs in the City of Jonesboro is essential to protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. Provision of stormwater management programs and systems results in both service and benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the City of Jonesboro in a variety of ways. 
                  (3)  Failure to effectively manage stormwater runoff can result in flooding, streambank and ditch erosion, property damage and degradation of water quality, aquatic habitat and biological communities. Failure to manage these impacts can put the City of Jonesboro's ability to receive state and federal grants and permits at risk. 
                  (4)  The volume and quantity of stormwater generated by a development has been proven to be most closely associated with the amount of impervious surface on the property, therefore, the square footage of impervious surface is the most appropriate factor for calculating stormwater utility fees. 
                  (5)  Clayton County, Forest Park, Jonesboro, Lake City, Lovejoy, Morrow, and Riverdale, presently own and operate stormwater management systems which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness of the existing stormwater systems owned and operated by these entities, and of additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the entities to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems in the City of Jonesboro in concert with the management of other water resources in the county. In order to do so, there must be adequate and stable funding for the City of Jonesboro's stormwater management program's operating needs and capital. 
                  (6)  The feasibility report submitted to the county, cities, and Clayton County Water Authority (CCWA) properly assesses and defines the stormwater management problems, needs, goals, program priorities and funding opportunities of the stormwater utility. 
                  (7)  As a result, the county's governing authority finds that a utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering storm water management services and the county's governing authority finds that a utility fee provides the most practical and appropriate means of funding storm water management services in the City of Jonesboro.

                  Sec. 34-362. - Definitions. 
                  The following definitions shall apply to this article. Any word or phrase not defined below but otherwise defined in this Code shall be given that meaning. All other words or phrases shall be given their common ordinary meaning unless the context clearly requires otherwise. 
                  Credit shall mean a conditional reduction in the amount of a stormwater service charge to an individual property based on the provision and continuing presence of an effectively maintained and operational on-site stormwater system or facility or the provision of a service or activity by property owner, which system, facility, service, or activity reduces the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater services and facilities. The basis of such credits, if granted, will be defined by a specific written agreement at the determination of the stormwater official in accordance with the stormwater utility. 
                  Customer shall mean all persons or entities to whom the stormwater service charge is billed. 
                  Detached dwelling unit shall mean developed land containing one structure which is not attached to another dwelling and which contains one or more bedrooms, with a bathroom and kitchen facilities, designed for occupancy by one family. Detached dwelling units may include houses, manufactured homes, and mobile homes located on one or more individual lots or parcels of land. Developed land may be classified as a detached dwelling unit despite the presence of incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports, or small storage buildings, or the presence of a commercial use within the dwelling unit so long as such use does not result in additional impervious areas such as parking spaces, playgrounds, or structures or additions to the building which are used as offices, storage facilities, meeting rooms, classrooms, houses of worship, or similar non-residential uses. Detached dwelling unit shall not include developed land containing: structures used primarily for non-residential purposes, manufactured homes and mobile homes located within manufactured home or mobile home parks where the land is owned by others than the owners of the manufactured homes or mobile homes, or multiple dwelling unit residential properties. 
                  Developed land means real property which has been altered from its "natural" state by addition of any improvements, such as grading, paving, compaction, construction of structures or impervious surfaces greater than 200 square feet, or drainage works so that hydrologic response of the property is changed from that which would occur in the natural undeveloped conditions. For new construction, property shall be considered developed pursuant to this article upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy, or upon completion of construction or final inspection if no such certificate is issued. 
                  Hydrologic response of a property is the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from a property. It is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious area; the size, shape, topographic, vegetative, and geologic conditions of a property; antecedent moisture conditions; and groundwater conditions on a property. 
                  Impervious surfaces shall mean those areas, which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil as it entered in natural conditions prior to development. The following types of surfaces will be considered "impervious surfaces" for purposes of the stormwater utility: the projected area of buildings; asphalt-, concrete-, brick-, or stone-paved areas; improved vehicular drives and parking areas; compacted gravel and soil surfaces; fabric or plastic coverings; and other surfaces that prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff or that change the hydrologic response of the property that existed prior to development. 
                  Multi-family residential shall mean developed land where more than one attached or detached residential dwelling units are located, including, but not limited to apartment houses, condominiums, townhomes, attached single-family homes, boarding houses, group homes, hotels and motels, retirement centers, and other structures in which more than one family groups commonly and normally reside or could reside. 
                  Service charges shall mean the stormwater management service charges applicable to a parcel of developed land, which charge shall be reflective of the service provided by CCWA stormwater utility. The charge shall be used to fund the City of Jonesboro stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and systems. Service charges are based on measurable parameters that influence the stormwater utility's cost of providing services and facilities, with the most important factor being the amount of impervious area on each parcel of land. The use of impervious area as a service charge rate parameter shall not preclude the use of other parameters, or the grouping of properties having similar characteristics through the use of ranges or rounding up or down to a consistent numerical interval, or the use of flat-rate charges for one or more classes of similarly-situated properties whose impact on the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities is relatively consistent. Stormwater service charges may also include special charges to the owners of particular properties for services or facilities uniquely related to stormwater management of that property, including but not limited to charges for development plan review, inspection of development projects and on-site stormwater control systems, and enhanced level of stormwater services above those normally provided by CCWA. 
                  Single family residential shall mean a developed lot containing one dwelling structure with its principal use being residential. 
                  Stormwater development guidelines are those guidelines established by CCWA which specify approved design criteria, construction materials and construction methods for components of the stormwater management system. 
                  Stormwater management system means any one or more of the various devices used in the collection, treatment, or conveyance of storm, flood or surface drainage waters, including all manmade structures or natural watercourse for the conveyance or transportation of runoff, such as: detention areas, lakes, berms, swales, improved watercourses, open channels, streams, culverts, pipes, catch basins inlets; collection, or drainage. 
                  Stormwater official is the CCWA General Manager or his/her appointee that has direct responsibility for the management of the CCWA stormwater utility. 
                  Stormwater unit (SU) shall mean the unit of measure which provides the basis for comparing the runoff generated by customer's developed land with that generated by another's. A SU shall be the average impervious coverage of a statistical sampling of single-family residential lots in the City of Jonesboro. A stormwater unit has been determined through engineering and analysis to be 2,950 square feet of impervious surface. This unit will be used to determine and compute the service charge for all developed land served by the CCWA stormwater utility. 
                  Stormwater utility guidebook shall mean the document that defines the basis for the stormwater utility, policies and procedures for operating the utility, and other necessary information determined to help document how the utility was developed and how it is operated. 
                  Undeveloped land is land in its unaltered natural state or which has been modified to such minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural state shall be deemed undeveloped. Undeveloped land shall have no pavement, asphalt, or compacted gravel surfaces or structures in excess of 200 square feet which create an impervious surface that would prevent infiltration of stormwater or cause stormwater to collect, concentrate, or flow in a manner materially different than that which would occur if the land was in an unaltered natural state.

                  Sec. 34-363. - Establishment of a utility. 
                  (a)  The City of Jonesboro hereby consents to the establishment of a county-wide stormwater utility (the "stormwater utility") by the CCWA which shall be responsible for stormwater management county-wide, and shall provide for, the management, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater management systems. Specific areas of regulation and maintenance are established in the Stormwater Utility Guidebook so long as they are not in conflict with the terms of this article or that certain intergovernmental agreement dated, as amended from time to time, between CCWA and the City of Jonesboro. 
                  (b)  Pursuant to the terms of this article and that certain intergovernmental agreement, as amended from time to time, between CCWA and the City of Jonesboro, the CCWA shall carry out and perform on behalf of the City of Jonesboro, all of the City of Jonesboro's duties and responsibilities with respect to stormwater management services, enforcement, and systems heretofore owned and operated by the city. 
                  (Ord. No. 2006-02, § 34-252, 3-13-2006) 
                  Sec. 34-364. - Scope of responsibility for the stormwater utility. 
                  (a)  The stormwater utility shall monitor the design, operation, maintenance, inspection, construction, and use of all stormwater management systems in the county. The stormwater utility shall be responsible for the design and construction of public stormwater facilities owned by the county and shall inspect, operate, and maintain them as prescribed herein. The stormwater utility shall provide services which relate to the: 
                  •  Transfer, control, conveyance or movement of stormwater runoff through the City of Jonesboro; 
                  •  Maintenance, repair and replacement of existing city- or county-owned stormwater management systems; 
                  •  Planning, development, design and construction of additional stormwater management systems and facilities to meet current and anticipated needs; 
                  •  Maintenance and/or improvement of water quality in waterways throughout the City of Jonesboro. 
                  •  Regulation of the use of stormwater management services, systems; and 
                  •  Complying with the federal and state regulations related to stormwater management including the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District (MNGWPD) watershed management requirements. 
                  •  Education of the public regarding stormwater issues. 
                  The stormwater utility shall not provide stormwater services related to Erosion and Sedimentation Control (EandSC). 
                  (b)  The stormwater utility shall be responsible for plan approval and construction inspection of both private stormwater systems and public stormwater systems not owned by the county. Design and construction of public or private stormwater management facilities will be governed by the CCWA's Stormwater Development Guidelines which specify design criteria, construction materials and construction methods. The CCWA Stormwater Development Guidelines will supersede any previously adopted stormwater design or construction guidelines. Additionally, the stormwater utility may accept the responsibility for the operation and maintenance of private stormwater systems only when such services have been agreed to, contracted for, and approved by the governing authority of the utility. 
                  (c)  The stormwater utility shall provide for inspection of private stormwater systems to ascertain that the stormwater systems are functioning as designed and approved. The MNGWPD post-development stormwater ordinance has been adopted by Clayton County, Forest Park, Jonesboro, Morrow, Lake City, Lovejoy, and Riverdale. Property owners who fail to maintain their stormwater systems will be notified of the violation. If within 30 days (or 24 hours if there is an immediate danger to public safety), no actions are taken, the CCWA may enter the property and correct the failure. The cost for the repair work may be a charge on the customer's water, sewer and stormwater bill or a lien on the property that may be placed on the tax bill. 
                  (d)  The CCWA owns or has rights established by written agreements which allow it to operate, maintain, improve and access those stormwater management systems and facilities which are located: 
                  (1)  Within public road rights-of-way and easements; 
                  (2)  On public land which is owned by the county, cities, or other governmental entity, and to which CCWA has agreements for the operation, maintenance, improvement and access to the stormwater management system; 
                  (3)  Operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of stormwater management systems which are located on private or public property not owned by the county or cities, and for which there has been no written agreement granting easements, rights-of-entry, rights of-access, rights-of-use or other form of dedication thereof to CCWA for operation, maintenance, improvement and access of such stormwater management systems, shall be and remain the legal responsibility of the property owner, except as otherwise provided for by the laws of the state and the United States; and 
                  (4)  It is the express intent of this article to protect the public health, safety and welfare of people and property in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person, or to any specific property within or outside the boundaries of the county or cities. CCWA has expressly reserved the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages or equitable remedies upon the CCWA, its directors, and employees arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship. 
                  (e)  The stormwater utility shall provide for effective management of a uniform stormwater plan and program throughout the City of Jonesboro and provide compliance with the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer NPDES Permit issued to each jurisdiction including but not limited to the following components: 
                  •  Public education and outreach on stormwater issues; 
                  •  Public involvement and participation; 
                  •  Illicit discharge detection and elimination; 
                  •  Post-construction stormwater management; 
                  •  Pollution prevention; 
                  •  Floodplain management;

                  Sec. 34-365. - Stormwater service charges authorized. 
                  The CCWA is authorized to impose a service charge on each customer of the stormwater system, provided that such charge is closely associated with the amount of impervious surface associated with a particular property for which the service charge is imposed. The stormwater utility guidebook shall provide for the rate structure which shall determine overall charges for properties served by the stormwater utility, based in part on the number of stormwater units each property is determined to consist of. The stormwater service charge and rate structure may be amended from time to time by official action of the CCWA Board of Directors. The CCWA shall review the stormwater service charge and rate structure on an annual basis and any rate changes will be approved by the CCWA Board of Directors.

                  Sec. 34-368. - Credits. 
                  (a)  To the extent practicable, credits against stormwater service charges shall be provided for on-site stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to CCWAs standards by private property owners which eliminate, mitigate or compensate for the impact that the property or person may have upon stormwater runoff discharged to public stormwater management systems and facilities or to private stormwater management systems which impact the proper function of public stormwater management systems. 
                  (b)  Property owners of developed land may receive a stormwater service charge credit. The specific credits will be determined based on the guidelines in the stormwater utility guidebook. Credits for structural controls will be based on best management practices performance as defined by the design criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, First Edition, August 2001. 
                  (c)  Credits may be partial or full credits and property owners can receive a maximum 40 percent credit. 
                  (d)  Property owners seeking stormwater service charge credits must apply for stormwater service charge credits through completion and submittal to the CCWA of a stormwater service charge credit application. 
                  (e)  Upon receipt of a completed application, the CCWA shall review the application and make a determination as to whether the applicable criteria for a credit have been met. All decisions regarding the approval or disapproval of a stormwater credit shall be made within 45 days of the date the completed application was received by CCWA. 
                  (f)  Any credit allowed against the service charge is conditioned on (1) continuing compliance with the CCWAs design and performance standards as may be updated or amended from time to time; and (2) upon continuing provision of the systems or facilities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner or owners upon which the credit is based. The CCWA may revoke any credit at any time for non-compliance with this article. 
                  (g)  Stormwater utility fees may be adjusted retroactively to the date that CCWA received the completed application. 
                  (h)  Applicants receiving credit for a structural control as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual must have an approved maintenance plan on file with CCWA and the applicant's property must have on-site stormwater management and treatment facilities. 
                  (i)  A customer shall reapply every five years for the credit granted, however, CCWA may terminate the credit if CCWA finds the facility does not comply with the original approved credit application.

                  Sec. 34-371. - Stormwater utility enforcement. 
                  (a)  Every owner of developed real property located in the City of Jonesboro, and every person who serves as a contractor or developer for the purpose of developing real property located in the City of Jonesboro shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater management systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, treat, control and discharge stormwater in a safe manner consistent with all City of Jonesboro ordinances and development regulations, and the laws of the State of Georgia and the United States of America. 
                  (b)  When the stormwater official determines that a public nuisance exists, the stormwater official shall send a notice of violation by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner or owners of the property described, as their name and address are shown on the latest ad valorem tax records of the county property appraiser. This notice shall be deemed complete and sufficient when so addressed and deposited in the United States mail with proper postage prepaid. The notice of violation shall inform the property owner that a violation of this article exists on the identified property with the description of the public nuisance, that the property owner is responsible for maintaining the identified private storm water system, that the property owner may allow the city access to the property to abate the nuisance at the expense of the property owner, and that formal enforcement action will be taken if the violation is not corrected within the time period indicated on the notice. The stormwater official shall determine a reasonable period of time for correction of the nuisance. In determining a reasonable period of time, the stormwater official shall consider the following: practicality and ease of correction; the owner's ability to correct the violation; the severity of the violation; the nature, extent, and probability of danger to the public, and other relevant factors. 
                  Notice, as required under this provision, shall not be required: (a) when the stormwater official determines that the public nuisance presents an imminent endangerment to persons or property; (b) when a notice of violation has been sent to the same property owner or owners for the same violation within the previous three months; or (c) when notice by certified mail cannot be effected on the owners of record. 
                  The notice of violation shall contain substantially the following information and may be in the following form or other appropriate form: notice of violation: name of owner; address of owner; description of property; inspection date; determination made by the stormwater official that the condition on the property is creating adverse conditions so as to constitute a violation of the this article; describe the conditions that caused the property to be in violation and any recommended actions that may be necessary to remedy the nuisance; specify a reasonable time period to proceed and remedy the nuisance; or provide written permission to the city to enter the site and abate the nuisance at owner's expense. Within the reasonable period of time for compliance specified in the notice of violation, the property owner shall either abate the nuisance or file a written request with CCWA for a hearing before the stormwater official to show that the condition alleged in the notice does not exist or that such condition does not constitute a public nuisance in violation of the ordinance. 
                  (c)  Any failure to meet the obligation set forth in this section shall constitute a nuisance and be subject to an abatement action filed by any damaged party or the City of Jonesboro in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the owner fails to properly abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the court, the CCWA may enter upon the property and cause such work as is reasonably necessary to abate the nuisance with the actual cost thereof assessed against the owner or developer, if any, on a joint and several basis. From the date of the filing of such action, the CCWA shall have lien rights, which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of the superior court or city court. CCWA shall have the right, pursuant to the authority of this article, for its designated officers and employees to enter upon private and public property owned by entities other than the City of Jonesboro, upon reasonable notice to the owner thereof, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests thereon in order to assure compliance with this section.

                  (2)  The commission shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material change(s) in the appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the aesthetic, historic, or architectural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district. In making this determination, the commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the following criteria for each of the following acts: 
                  a.  Reconstruction, alteration, new construction or renovation. The commission shall issue certificates of appropriateness for the above proposed actions if those actions conform in design, scale, building materials, setback and site features, and to the secretary of interior's standards for rehabilitation and guidelines for rehabilitating historic buildings. 
                  b.  Relocation. A decision by the commission approving or denying a certificate of appropriateness for the relocation of a building, structure, or object shall be guided by: 
                  1.  The historic character and aesthetic interest the building, structure or object contributes to its present setting. 
                  2.  Whether there are definite plans for the area to be vacated and what the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area will be. 
                  3.  Whether the building, structure or object can be moved without significant damage to its physical integrity. 
                  4.  Whether the proposed relocation area is compatible with the historical and architectural character of the building, structure, site or object. 
                  c.  Demolition. A decision by the commission approving or denying a certificate of appropriateness for the demolition of buildings, structures, sites, trees judged to be 50 years old or older, or objects shall be guided by: 
                  1.  The historic, scenic or architectural significance of the building, structure, site, tree or object. 
                  2.  The importance of the building, structure, site, tree, or object to the ambiance of a district. 
                  3.  The difficulty or the impossibility of reproducing such a building, structure, site, tree, or object because of its design, texture, material, detail, or unique location. 
                  4.  Whether the building, structure, site, tree or object is one of the last remaining examples of its kind in the neighborhood or the city. 
                  5.  Whether there are definite plans for use of the property if the proposed demolition is carried out, and what the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area would be. 
                  6.  Whether reasonable measures can be taken to save the building, structure, site, tree, or object from collapse. 
                  7.  Whether the building, structure, site, tree, or object is capable of earning reasonable economic return on its value. 
                  (g)  Undue hardship. When, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this article would result in the exceptional practical difficulty or undue economic hardship upon any owner of a specific property, the commission, in passing upon applications, shall have the power to vary or modify strict provisions, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided such variances, modifications interpretations shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of said provisions, so that the architectural or historical integrity, or character of the property, shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variances, the commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgment, best fulfill the purpose of this article. An undue hardship shall not be a situation of the person's own making. 
                  (h)  Deadline for approval or rejection of application for certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (1)  The commission shall approve or reject an application for a certificate of appropriateness within 45 days after the receipt of a complete and conforming application filed by the owner or occupant of a historic property, or of a building structure, site, or object located within a historic district. Evidence of approval shall be by a certificate of appropriateness issued by the commission. Notice of the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness shall be sent by United States mail to the applicant and all other persons who have requested such notice in writing filed with the commission. 
                  (2)  Failure of the commission to act within said 45 days shall constitute approval, and no other evidence of approval shall be needed. 
                  (i)  Necessary action to be taken by commission upon rejection of application for certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (1)  In the event the commission rejects an application, it shall state its reasons for doing so, and shall transmit a record of such actions and reasons, in writing, to the applicant. The commission may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves of the application submitted. The applicant, if he/she so desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so. 
                  (2)  In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of the application for a certificate of appropriateness by the commission shall be binding upon the building inspector or other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits and, in such a case, no building permit shall be issued. 
                  (j)  Requirement of conformance with certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (1)  All work performed pursuant to an issued certificate of appropriateness shall conform to the requirements of such certificate. In the event work is performed not in accordance with such certificate, the commission shall issue a cease and stoppage order of all work. 
                  (2)  The commission and the city council shall be authorized to institute any appropriate action or proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent any material change in appearance of a designated historic property or historic district, except those changes made in compliance with the provisions of this article or to prevent any illegal act or conduct with respect to such historic property or historic district. 
                  (k)  Certificate of appropriateness void if construction not commenced. A certificate of appropriateness shall become void unless construction is commenced within six months of date of issuance. Certificates of appropriateness shall be issued for a period of 18 months and are renewable. 
                  (l)  Recording an application for certificate of appropriateness. The commission shall keep a public record of all applications for certificates of appropriateness, and of all the commission's proceedings in connection with said application. 
                  (m)  Acquisition of property. The commission may, where such action is authorized by the city council and is reasonably necessary or appropriate for the preservation of a unique historic property, enter into negotiations with the owner for the acquisition by gift, purchase, exchange, or otherwise, to the property or any interest therein. 
                  (n)  Appeals. Any person adversely affected by any determination made by the commission relative to the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness may appeal such determination to the city council. Any such appeal must be filed with the city manager/city planning director within 15 days after the issuance of the determination pursuant to subsection (h)(1) herein or, in the case of a failure of the commission to act, within 15 days of the expiration of the 45-day period allowed for the commission action under subsection (h)(2) herein. The city council may approve, modify, or reject the determination made by the commission, if the governing body finds that the commission abused its discretion in reaching its decision. Appeals from decisions of the city council may be taken to the superior court of the county in the manner provided by law for appeals from conviction for the city of ordinance violations.

                  (a)  Certificate of appropriateness not required for ordinary maintenance or repair. Ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural or environmental feature in or on a historic property to correct deterioration, decay, or to sustain the existing form, and that does not involve a material change in design, material or outer appearance thereof, does not require a certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (b)  Failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair. Property owners of historic properties or properties within historic districts shall not allow their buildings to deteriorate by failing to provide ordinary maintenance or repair. The commission shall be charged with the following responsibilities regarding deterioration by neglect. 
                  (1)  The commission shall monitor the condition of historic properties and existing buildings in historic districts to determine if they are being allowed to deteriorate by neglect. Such conditions as broken windows, doors and exterior openings which allow the elements and vermin to enter, or the deterioration of a buildings structural system shall constitute failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair. 
                  (2)  In the event the commission determines a failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair, the commission will notify the owner of the property and set forth the steps which needs to be taken to remedy the situation. The owner of such property will have 30 days in which to do this. 
                  (3)  In the event that the condition is not remedied in 30 days, the owner shall be punished as provided in section 42-32 herein. At the direction of the city council, the commission may perform such maintenance or repair as is necessary to prevent deterioration by neglect. The owner of the property shall be liable for the cost of such maintenance and repair performed by the commission. 
                  (c)  Affirmation of existing building and zoning costs. Nothing in this article shall be constructed as to exempt property owners from complying with existing city/county building and zoning codes, nor prevent any property owner from making any use of this property not prohibited by other statutes, ordinances or regulations.

                  (Res. No. 2005-10, § 1-1-1.1, 8-15-05) 
                  Sec. 44-52. - Purpose and intent. 
                  Wetlands are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the well being of communities in the State of Georgia. Nationally, a considerable number of wetlands have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other activities. Without additional regulation, piecemeal or cumulative losses of wetlands will continue to occur over time. Therefore, it is in the interest of public safety and general welfare to avoid damage or destruction to wetlands. The purpose of these regulations is to promote wetlands protection by adopting a generalized wetlands map; provide for the withholding of land use and building permits in areas designated as wetlands until a jurisdictional wetland determination is completed; and establish permitted and prohibited land uses within wetlands shown on the generalized wetlands map, current edition. 
                  (Res. No. 2005-10, § 1-1-1.2, 8-15-05) 
                  Sec. 44-53. - Definitions. 
                  Generalized wetlands map: A map of wetlands provided in any U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) map showing wetlands within the local jurisdiction, current edition. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland: An area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland determination: A delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1344, as amended. 
                  Regulated activity: Any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States excepting those activities exempted in Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 
                  Wetlands: Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation.

                  Sec. 44-56. - Permit required. 
                  No land use permit or building permit shall be issued by the city manager for a land use, building, structure, or manufactured home, nor shall any regulated activity as defined by these regulations commence, unless the land use, building, structure, manufactured home or regulated activity conforms to the requirements of these regulations. Prior to a land use permit or building permit being issued, the city manager shall require a site plan or subdivision plat in sufficient detail to review the proposed development for compliance with the provisions of these regulations.

                  If an area proposed for development is located within 25 feet of a wetland as shown on the generalized wetlands map, as determined by the city manager, no local land use permit or building permit on said wetland shall be issued until a jurisdictional wetland determination has been completed and either of the following occur: 
                  (1)  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determines that there are jurisdictional wetlands present on the proposed development site, a Section 404 permit is required, and either a Section 404 permit or a letter of permission is issued by the Corps for the proposed development; or, 
                  (2)  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determines that jurisdictional wetlands are not present on the proposed development site, and no Section 404 permit or letter of permission is required.

Each lot shall have access to a public street and a minimum of 50 feet of lot frontage on a public street; provided, however, that the local governing body may permit one or more lots to be accessed by private streets, as more fully specified in article IV of these regulations; provided further, that in the case of a lot accessed by a circular cul-de-sac, the minimum lot frontage may be reduced to 30 feet. 
                  (c)  Adequate buildable area required. Land subject to flooding, improper drainage or erosion, or that is unsuitable for residential or other use for topographical or other reasons, shall not be platted for residential use nor for any other use that will continue or increase the danger to health, safety, or of property destruction, unless the hazards can be and are corrected. Each lot shall contain an adequate building site not subject to flooding and outside the limits of any existing easements or building setback lines required by the local governing body. 
                  (d)  Lot remnants not permitted. All remands of lots below any required minimum lot size that may be remaining upon subdividing of a larger tract must be added to adjacent lots, rather than allowed to remain as unusable parcels. The city manager may permit a lot remnant for a specific purpose such as open space or a detention pond, provided that access and design are in accordance with city standards and the lot remnant is restricted to specific non-building use. 
                  (e)  Service areas. Commercial and industrial lots shall be adequate to provide service areas and off-street parking suitable to the use intended. 
                  (f)  Lot area. The minimum lot area shall not be less than that established by the zoning district in which the lot is located.

                  (j)  Corner lots. Corner lots shall have adequate width to meet the front building setback requirements from all rights-of-way. One of the street frontages shall be designated as the front yard, the yard opposite the designated front yard shall become the rear yard, and the yard opposite the remaining street frontage shall become the side yard. The resulting setbacks (two front, one rear, one side) shall meet the applicable setback requirements. 
                  (k)  Double frontage lots. Double frontage or "through" lots should be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from arterials or overcome specific disadvantages of topography or orientation.

                  Sec. 44-123. - Preliminary plat. 
                  (a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to ensure compliance with the basic design concepts and improvement requirements of subdivisions and land developments through the submittal of a preliminary plat of all major subdivisions for review and approval by the mayor and city council. 
                  (b)  When required. All major subdivisions, and any subdivision involving the dedication of a public street, shall require the submission of a preliminary plat to the city manager for review and approval by the mayor and city council. Prior to the issuance of any permit for land disturbance, or the installation of any improvements, the mayor and city council must approve the preliminary plat, if required. 
                  (c)  Preliminary plat application and specifications. Preliminary plat applications shall be made in accordance with requirements shown in Table 1 of section 44-125, and preliminary plats shall meet the minimum plat specifications shown in Table 2 of section 44-125. 
                  (d)  Procedures. Upon receipt of a completed preliminary plat application, the city manager shall schedule the application for the next public meeting before the mayor and city council and forward a staff report and all pertinent materials in the application to the mayor and city council for review. An application for preliminary plat approval must be submitted at least 60 days before the regular meeting date of the mayor and city council to be considered on that agenda. The mayor and city council shall have 60 days from the date the public meeting is held to approve, conditionally approve, or deny the preliminary plat application. The basis of the mayor and city council's review of and action on a preliminary plat shall be whether the preliminary plat meets the purposes and requirements of these regulations, and all other ordinances that relate to the proposed development. 
                  (e)  Disposition. Approval of a preliminary plat shall be valid for a period of one year, within which time a complete construction plans application must be submitted. If a completed application for construction plans is not submitted during that time, preliminary plat approval shall expire and be null and void. 
                  (f)  Appeal. Denial of preliminary plat approval may be appealed to the mayor and council. 
                  (g)  Amendments to approved preliminary plats. The city manager is authorized to approve minor amendments to preliminary plats. A minor amendment is defined as a change to the preliminary plat that does not significantly alter the overall development scheme, causes the plat to not be in compliance with the zoning ordinance or land development regulations, and does not adversely affect the public interest. Examples include changes of less than ten percent to density, lot size, percentage of open space reserved, or street access provisions. Any proposed amendment to a preliminary plat that is determined by the city manager to constitute a matter of public interest shall be deemed a major amendment. For all amendments to preliminary plats determined to be major amendments, mayor and city council approval shall be required. The mayor and city council shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny the proposed major amendment to a preliminary plat. Procedures for considering a major amendment to a preliminary plat shall be the same as required for an initial application for preliminary plat approval.

                  Sec. 44-124. - Construction plans. 
                  (a)  Application. Upon approval of a preliminary plat, the subdivider or land developer may apply for construction plan approval. In the case of a minor subdivision, or in cases where a preliminary plat is not required by this article, the subdivider or land developer may apply for approval of construction plans; provided, however, that in the case of a minor subdivision or land development the applicant for construction plan approval should hold a pre-application conference with the city manager to ensure that plans meet the intent and specific provisions of these regulations and other applicable regulations. The construction plan approval process is administrative. Applications for construction plan approval shall be made in accordance with requirements shown in the Tables 1 and 2 of section 44-125 below. No application for construction plans shall be accepted for processing nor approved by the city manager until a preliminary plat, if required, has been approved by the mayor and city council and the proposed construction plans are found by the city manager to be in substantial conformity with said approval and any conditions of such approval. 
                  (b)  City manager's decision criteria. The sole basis upon which the city manager may deny a construction plan is the failure of the application to meet the requirements of these regulations or any other applicable local regulations or the failure of the construction plans and application to meet the requirements of preliminary plat approval specified by the mayor and city council. 
                  (c)  Certificate of approval. All copies of the construction plans shall be noted by inscription on the plans noting such approval by the city manager. Construction plan approval shall expire and be null and void after a period of one year following approval, unless activity toward improvements on the land has been initiated as deemed by the city manager, or unless the city manager approves an extension of time. If at any time after the extension is approved the site is inactive for a period of one month, the extension may be revoked by the city manager and a new submittal shall be required.

Acceptance of such dedication shall be accomplished by resolution of the mayor and city council, a certified copy of which shall be attached to both the deed of dedication and the final plat.

                  Sec. 44-127. - Subdivision improvement guarantees. 
                  In order to protect the city and prospective purchasers of and residents in a subdivision, the subdivider/developer shall provide the financial security to guarantee the installation of public improvements. The subdivider or developer's financial guarantee may be any of the following: 
                  (1)  An escrow of funds with the city; 
                  (2)  An escrow with a bank or savings and loan association upon which the city can draw; 
                  (3)  An irrevocable letter of commitment or credit upon which the city can draw; 
                  (4)  A performance bond for the benefit of the city upon which the city can collect, or a certificate of deposit with assignment letter; and 
                  (5)  Any other form of guarantee approved by the mayor and city council that will satisfy the objectives of this section. The guarantee shall be in an amount to secure the full costs, as determined by the city, of constructing or installing the improvements and utilities required. 
                  (Res. No. 2005-10, § 1-2-17, 8-15-05) 
                  Sec. 44-128. - Limitations on minor subdivisions. 
                  (a)  Purpose. Minor subdivisions provide certain advantages to the applicant, such as a shorter application process and less public scrutiny, that tend to favor their use over the filing of major subdivision applications. Given these advantages, the prospect exists that subdividers may seek to divide a parcel via consecutive and/or contiguous minor subdivisions instead of filing for a major subdivision. It is the intent of the mayor and city council to prohibit the practice of such "chain" subdivisions where the same land owner subdivides land and then files minor subdivision applications on common contiguous parcels, which collectively total more than three lots. It is also the intent of the mayor and city council to prohibit adjacent minor subdivisions within a three-year time period, in cases where part of an original tract of land is now owned by another person or entity and was transferred or sold to another owner with the apparent intent to circumvent the major subdivision process. 
                  (b)  Common contiguous parcels shown on minor subdivision plats. Contiguous common parcels, as defined by these regulations, shall be referenced on all applications for minor subdivisions, and contiguous common parcels shall be considered part of any application for minor subdivision, for purposes of determining whether or not the division of land proposed is a major subdivision or a minor subdivision. 
                  (c)  Limitations. Land within a minor subdivision, including all contiguous parcels owned by the subdivider, shall not be further divided for a period of three years unless a preliminary plat application is filed and approved as a major subdivision pursuant to the requirements of these regulations. If property proposed to be subdivided was part of an original tract, and if the property proposed to be subdivided abuts land that has been divided as a minor subdivision in the last three years, then minor subdivision of said property shall be prohibited. This provision shall not be construed to prohibit the approval of two contiguous minor subdivisions under separate ownership; however, this provision is intended to be construed liberally so that one property owner does not develop a minor subdivision on part of an original tract and transfer or sell another part of the original tract for the purposes of minor subdivision within a three-year period. It is the intent that land abutting a minor subdivision that was owned by the subdivider of the abutting minor subdivision shall not be subdivided as a minor subdivision for a period of three years, regardless of ownership.

                  Sec. 44-129. - Private streets. 
                  (a)  Private streets permitted. Private streets may, upon application, be permitted by the mayor and city council within major subdivisions, subject to the requirements of this section. Applications for approval of private streets shall be considered by the mayor and city council at the time of preliminary plat approval by the mayor and city council. Following consideration by the mayor and city council to authorize private streets in a major subdivision, the mayor and city council shall consider the application and may impose conditions on the approval of private streets to achieve various public purposes and to avoid potential problems with private streets. No final plat involving a private street shall be approved unless said final plat conforms to the requirements of this section. 
                  (b)  Engineering plans required. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to construct a new private street or alter an existing private street or to cause the same to be done without first obtaining approval of engineering and construction plans from the city manager in accordance with the requirements of these regulations and article IV of this code. 
                  (c)  Standards. All private streets shall be constructed to all standards for public streets as required by article IV of this code, applicable construction specifications of the City, Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) standards and as approved by the city manager. 
                  (d)  Street names and signs. Private streets shall be named, subject to the approval of the city manager. The subdivider of land involving a private street shall install street signs with content containing the street name and the designation "private," as approved by the city manager. The sign signifying the private street may be required by the city manager to be a different color than that of street signs provided for public streets, in order to distinguish maintenance responsibilities in the field. 
                  (e)  Easements. Easements for private streets shall be designated on final plats as general-purpose public access and utility easements, along with the name of said private street. Said easement shall at minimum be of the same width as that required for the right-of-way of a public street by the comprehensive plan or city manager for the type of public street (local, collector, etc.) most closely resembling the proposed private street. Easements for private streets shall not be included in any calculation of minimum lot size or limitations established by local zoning districts. In the cases of private streets, the general-purpose public access and utility easement for the private street shall either; 
                  (1)  Be shown in a manner on the final plat such that each lot fronting the private street extends to the centerline of the private street. No lot shall be permitted to be divided by the general purpose public access and utility easement required and established for a private street; or 
                  (2)  Shall be drawn as its own discrete parcel to be dedicated to a private homeowners association (i.e., not shown to be a part of any lot). 
                  (f)  Maintenance. The city shall not maintain, repair, resurface, rebuild, or otherwise improve streets, signs, drainage improvements or any other appurtenances within general purpose public access and utility easements established for private streets. A private maintenance covenant recorded with the County Clerk of the Superior Court shall be required for any private street and other improvements within general-purpose public access and utility easements established for private streets. The covenant shall set out the distribution of expenses, remedies for non-compliance with the terms of the agreement, rights to the use of easements, and other pertinent considerations. The covenant shall specifically include the following terms. 
                  (1)  The covenant shall establish minimum annual assessments in an amount adequate to defray costs of ordinary maintenance and procedures for approval of additional needed assessments. The covenant shall also specify that the funds from such assessments will be held by a homeowners or property owners association in cases of a subdivision of seven or more lots fronting on a private street. 
                  (2)  The covenant shall require the formation of a homeowner's association that will be responsible for maintenance and upkeep of all common areas of the development. 
                  (3)  The covenant shall include a periodic maintenance schedule. 
                  (4)  The covenant for maintenance shall be enforceable by any property owner served by the private street. 
                  (5)  The covenant shall establish a formula for assessing maintenance and repair costs equitably to property owners served by the private street. 
                  (6)  The covenant shall run with the land. 
                  (7)  The mayor and city council may, at its discretion, as a condition of approving private streets, require a performance bond and/or maintenance bond be submitted by the subdivider and held by a homeowners or property owners association, or the council may require that the subdivider pay an amount of money as recommended by the city manager into an escrow account or other suitable account for the maintenance and repair of private streets and stormwater management improvements, to be drawn from by the homeowners or property owners association as maintenance and repair needs may arise. 
                  (g)  Specifications for final plats involving private streets. The city manager shall not approve for recording any final plat involving a private street unless and until it shall contain the following on the face of the plat: 
                  (1)  Deed book and page reference to the recorded covenant required by this section; 
                  (2)  "WARNING, City of Jonesboro has no responsibility to build, improve, maintain, or otherwise service the private streets, drainage improvements, or other appurtenances contained within the general public purpose access or utility easement or easements for private streets shown on this plat."; 
                  (3)  "Grant of Easement. The general purpose public access and utility easement(s) shown on this plat for private street(s) is hereby granted and said grant of rights shall be liberally construed to provide all necessary authority to the City, and to public or private utility companies serving the subdivision, for the installation and maintenance of utilities, including, but not limited to, electric lines, gas lines, telephone lines, water lines, sewer lines, cable television lines, and fiber optic cables, together with the right to trim interfering trees and brush, together with a perpetual right of ingress and egress for installation, maintenance, and replacement of such improvements. 

                  (4)  (The following certificate of dedication shall be required, unless the mayor and city council waives the dedication requirement.) 
                  "Certificate of Dedication. All water and sewer lines installed within the general purpose public access and utility easement(s) shown on this plat for private street(s) are hereby dedicated to the City of Jonesboro. 

                  (h)  Requirement for purchaser's acknowledgement of private responsibilities. Prior to the sale or as a condition of the closing of a real estate transaction involving any lot served by a private street in the city, the subdivider or seller of said lot shall execute a notarized purchaser's acknowledgement of private street construction and drainage maintenance responsibilities as set forth below. A copy of the purchaser's acknowledgement shall be retained by the purchaser and shall be required to be submitted as a condition of a building permit for a principal building on said lot: 
                  "Purchaser's Acknowledgement of Private Street and Drainage Maintenance Responsibility 
                  (I)/(We) have read the Declaration of Covenant which pertains to the lot that is the subject of this real estate transaction _______ (insert address or attach legal description). (I)/(We) understand that the Declaration of Covenant applies to the lot that (I am)/(we are) purchasing and requires (me)/(us) to provide a specified percentage or amount of the financing for the construction and maintenance of any private street and drainage facilities serving the lot which (I am)/(we are) purchasing, and that owners of other lots on this plat may sue for and recover those costs which this covenant requires (me)/(us) to pay, plus their damages resulting from (my)/(our) refusal to contribute, plus reasonable attorneys fees. (I)/(We) further understand that the City has no obligation to assist with the maintenance and improvement of the private street, drainage facilities, and other appurtenances within the general purpose public access and utility easement for the private road serving the above lot in question. (I)/(We) understand that a copy of this purchaser's acknowledgement shall be required as a condition of the issuance of a building permit for a principal building on the lot (I am)/(we are) purchasing.

                  For subdivisions and land developments that abut and access a public street, the subdivider or land developer shall install curb and gutter, sidewalk, other road improvements, and, if required, a deceleration lane and/or acceleration lane, according to standards and specifications of the city manager, along all abutting public streets. When a subdivision or land development uses an unpaved public right-of-way for access, the subdivider or land developer shall improve that right-of-way to a pavement width consistent with city road design standards. Said improvements shall be from the subdivision or land development entrance to the paved public road which the city manager determines will be the primary direction of travel for residents of the subdivision or occupants of the land development.

                  Sec. 44-158. - Standards for configuring new streets. 
                  (a)  Street alignment, intersections and jogs. Streets shall be aligned to join with planned or existing streets. Under normal conditions, streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles (90 degrees), but in no case shall such a street intersection be less than 75 degrees. Where street offsets or jogs cannot be avoided, offset "T" intersections shall be separated by a minimum centerline offset of 150 feet. 
                  (b)  Continuation of existing streets and connections. Existing streets, and their rights-of-way, shall be continued at the same or greater width, but in no case less than the required width. The mayor and city council may require that a major subdivision provide one or more future street connections to adjoining subdivisions or unsubdivided tracts. 
                  (c)  Street plans for future phases of the tract. Where the plat or site plan proposed to be subdivided or developed includes only part of the tract owned or intended for subdivision or development by the subdivider or land developer, a tentative plan of a future street system for the portion not slated for immediate subdivision consideration may be required by the city manager and if required shall be prepared and submitted by the subdivider or land developer. 
                  (d)  Dead-end streets and culs-de-sac. Streets that dead-end shall terminate in a cul-de-sac. The maximum length of such streets shall be 600 feet. Streets that are planned to continue at some future date shall provide a temporary cul-de-sac as required by the city manager. 
                  (e)  Marginal access streets. Whenever a major subdivision or non-residential development is proposed abutting the right-of-way of a U.S. or state highway, a marginal access street approximately parallel and adjacent to such right-of-way may be required by the mayor and city council at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of land between such marginal access street and highway right-of-way. A 20-foot no-access easement and planting strip along the major arterial street will be required to ensure that lots fronting on said street do not have access thereto. 
                  (f)  Alleys and service access. Alleys may be provided in non-residential developments. If they are provided, they must be paved. Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible; but if unavoidable, they shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities. Service access shall be provided to commercial and industrial developments for off-street loading, unloading, and parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed.

                  Sec. 44-159. - Requirements for streets. 
                  (a)  Bridges. Bridges on public rights-of-way shall meet current American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials standards and Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) standards, as determined by the city manager. 
                  (b)  Grading and stabilization of street rights-of-ways. When a new public street is proposed, all trees, brush, stumps, rocks, or other debris shall be cleared from the street right-of-way, except in cases where specimen trees or other features are required to be preserved by the city manager. All streets shall be graded to lines, grades and cross sections approved on plans. All unsurfaced disturbed portions of street rights-of-way shall be stabilized by seeding, fertilizing, and mulching or by another equally effective method. 
                  (c)  Radius at street intersections. The right-of-way radius at street intersections shall be a minimum of 15 feet, with larger radii for streets serving nonresidential development, as approved by the city manager. The minimum pavement (curb) radius at street intersections shall be 25 feet. 
                  (d)  Street grades. No street grade shall be less than one percent. No street grade for an arterial or collector street shall exceed eight percent. No other local street grade shall exceed 12 percent, unless the city manager finds that due to topographic conditions, a steeper grade is necessary, in which case the street grade shall not exceed 15 percent. Grades between 12 percent and 15 percent shall not exceed a length of 150 feet. 
                  (e)  Minimum street right-of-way and pavement widths. Street right-of-way and pavement widths shall at minimum meet the following: 

                   
                  (f)  Street horizontal alignment and reverse curves. Street horizontal alignments and reverse curves shall at minimum meet the following:

                  Sec. 44-160. - Curb cuts and access specifications. 
                  (a)  Entrance improvement specifications. Roadway entrances and improvements, including necessary acceleration and/or deceleration lane(s) and right/left turn lanes, shall be designed, installed, and maintained as approved by the state department of transportation, as applicable, or the city manager, in accordance with Georgia Department of Transportation specifications. All entrances or exits of any street or driveway, public or private, from or to any state highway shall be approved by the Georgia Department of Transportation and the city manager prior to the construction of such entrances or exits and prior to the issuance of any land use permit or building permit for any improvement to be served by such entrances or exits. All entrances or exits of any street or driveway, public or private, from or to any city street shall be approved by the city manager prior to the construction of such entrances or exits and prior to the issuance of any land use permit or building permit for any improvement to be served by such entrances or exits. 
                  (b)  Curb cut specifications. No curb cut shall be permitted to be located closer than 100 feet to the nearest existing or proposed right-of-way of an intersecting roadway or closer than 40 feet to a side property line unless the adjacent property owner is in agreement with the encroachment of the curb cut and approval is obtained from the city manager. Curb cuts shall be no narrower than 24 feet from back of curb to back of curb. Strict adherence to these requirements may not be practical in all instances as determined by the city manager. The city manager may limit the maximum width of a curb cut and/or the number of curb cuts to a parcel as necessary when it is deemed to be of benefit to the safety and welfare of the public. 
                  The following factors may be considered during the review and approval of a specific location of an entrance: the location of existing or planned median breaks; separation requirements between the entrance and major intersections; separation requirements between other entrances; the need to provide shared access with other sites; the need to align with previously approved or constructed access points on the opposite side of the street; and the minimum number of entrances needed to move traffic onto and off the site safely and efficiently. 
                  (c)  Access along and near divided highways. Where a divided highway exists or is planned, the following access standards shall be met: 

                   
                  (d)  Interparcel connections. New development that contains or is intended to contain more than one building or use on site shall provide connections so that automobile trips between and among such buildings or uses can be accomplished without using the highway or major street. New developments and substantial improvements to existing developments shall provide for pedestrian and automobile access connections between adjacent properties under different ownership when the uses of the properties are of such compatibility that patrons may frequent both buildings or uses in the same vehicle trip, unless the city manager otherwise.

                  Sec. 44-161. - Street lighting. 
                  Street lights shall be provided by the owner/developer in new subdivisions and developments which propose the construction of a new street to be dedicated to the city or along existing streets abutting the subdivision or land development. All fees, materials, labor, poles, fixtures and any other associated items shall be furnished, paid for and installed by the developer. The following standards shall apply: 
                  (1)  In a residential development, street lights shall be installed and operating prior to approval of the final plat. In a non-residential development, street lights are to be installed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy (C.O.) for the building(s). 
                  (2)  Lighting fixtures installed within the public rights-of-way to be operated for the purpose of street illumination shall comply with these standards. The minimum average horizontal foot-candle illumination level by roadway classification shall be: 

                   
                  The uniformity of illumination shall be such that the point of lowest illumination shall have at least one-third of the average horizontal foot-candle required illumination level, except that on local or residential streets it may not be less than one-sixth of this average. 
                  (3)  Any party requesting permission to install or operate lighting fixtures within public rights-of-way shall furnish plans and specifications to the city manager for approval showing how the proposed lighting meets the standards. No lighting shall be installed or operated without the approval of the city manager. Should the city manager disapprove a request to install lighting fixtures within any public right-of-way, he shall communicate disapproval in writing to the party requesting approval. The written communication shall include specific reasons for disapproval. Any disapproval of a light or lighting system may be appealed to the city council. The city council may reserve or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, and decision of determination appealed. 
                  (4)  Roadway or street lighting luminaries or fixtures installed within the public rights-of-way as "security lights" or for the purpose of lighting area other than the public streets shall be mounted on the side of the pole opposite from the street, and shall be oriented in such a manner to insure that the lateral light distribution pattern is parallel to the street and the vertical light distribution, at the initial source, is perpendicular to the street, so as to protect the users of the street from objectionable glare. The approval of the city manager shall be obtained prior to installation of these lights. 
                  (5)  Other lighting fixtures to be installed within or outside of public rights-of-way for whatever purpose shall be installed and operated in such a manner so as to prevent glare from being a hazard to or interfering with the normal use of the public rights-of-way. 
                  (6)  The use of full cut-off luminaires is required in all areas.

An adequate drainage system, separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system and including any necessary ditches, pipes, culverts, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges, etc., shall be provided for the proper drainage of all surface water for all subdivisions and land developments. Sizing and location of all drainage structures shall be the responsibility of a registered professional engineer. The city manager may require the use of on-site control methods such as retention or detention to mitigate the stormwater and drainage impacts of the proposed subdivisions and land developments. The mayor and city council shall not approve any preliminary plat of subdivision that does not make adequate provision for storm and flood water runoff channels or basins as determined by the city manager. No building permit shall be issued for any building within a subdivision or for the development of land, if there is not present throughout the subdivision or to the land development an adequate system of drainage and stormwater management. 
                  (b)  Method of design and capacity. Storm sewers, where required, shall be designed in accordance with the State of Georgia Stormwater Manual. In addition, all systems must be designed to reduce the stormwater runoff to ten percent less than the stormwater runoff of the pre-developed conditions of the site. For redevelopments, a pre-developed runoff coefficient of three-tenths will be required. A copy of design computations shall be submitted along with required plans. Drainage improvements shall accommodate potential runoff from the entire upstream drainage area within the site and shall be designed to prevent increases in downstream flooding. Capacity for a 25-year storm or rain shall be provided for all street drainage structures such as catch basin, inlets cross drains, etc. Capacity for a 100-year frequency storm event shall be provided for all main drainage structures such as retention/detention basins, principal storm sewers, and all types of flood protection works. 
                  (c)  Location. Drainage facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way where feasible, and shall be constructed in accordance with standards and specifications of the city manager. Catch basins shall be located at low points of streets. Where topography or other conditions are such as to make impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within road rights-of-way, perpetual, unobstructed easements at least 15 feet in width for drainage facilities shall be provided across property outside the road right-of-way and with satisfactory access to the road. 
                  (d)  Discharge. Drainage shall be designed so as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from each lot or land development site to adjacent lots, land development sites, or vacant properties. Storm water shall not be discharged directly to perennial streams. It shall be directed toward natural drainages. If water must be discharged to a stream, the water quality flowing into the stream must meet or exceed the water quality in the receiving waters. The water quantity flowing into the stream must be evaluated to ensure the stream channel can accommodate the increased flows and not disrupt or degrade the ecology of the water body. 
                  (e)  Grading and site drainage. Lots or land development sites shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away from all buildings, and drainage for individual lots or land development sites shall be coordinated with the general storm drainage pattern for the area. Buildings and parking lots shall be appropriately drained so as to prevent damage to abutting properties or public streets. All disturbed or graded ground areas of a building site not used for buildings or open storage areas shall be appropriately stabilized and grassed or covered with plants or landscaping materials. 
                  (f)  Cross-drainpipes. Where a watercourse separates the buildable area of a lot from the street by which it has access, provisions shall be made for installation of a culvert or other structure, the design of which shall be approved by the city manager. Cross-drains shall be provided to accommodate all natural waterflow, and shall be of sufficient length to permit full-width roadways and the required slopes. Cross drainpipes shall have head walls of an approved type on inlet and outlet ends of the pipe. Pipe installed within the right-of-way shall be reinforced concrete pipe. All storm drainpipes shall be minimum 18 inches in diameter. Storm sewer slopes shall be equal to or greater than one percent. 
                  (g)  Drop inlets. Drop inlets, at a minimum, shall be generally three-foot by three-foot boxes with two-foot by three-foot grates unless otherwise specified by the city manager. 
                  (h)  Easements. Where an irrigation ditch or channel, natural creek, stream or other drainage way crosses a subdivision or land development, the subdivider or developer shall provide an easement sufficient for drainage and maintenance. Easements shall be provided for all drainage facilities as approved by the city manager. When a subdivision or land development is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, channel, or intermittent stream, a stormwater or drainage easement of at least 25 feet shall be provided. 
                  (i)  Maintenance of detention facilities. Stormwater detention facilities are required to be maintained in a proper and appropriate manner to provide the water quality and detention as they were designed. Maintenance must be provided at least on an annual basis or due to a major stormwater event as outlined in the state stormwater management manual, latest edition. Failure to maintain a detention facility can result in the city assessing the cost of the maintenance and placing a lien against the property or homeowner's association.

                  (a)  Generally. All habitable buildings and buildable lots shall be connected to a water system capable of providing water for health and emergency purposes, including adequate fire protection. No building permit shall be issued for any building within a subdivision or for the development of land, if there is not present throughout the subdivision or to the land development an adequate water supply. 
                  (b)  Water main requirements. When a public water main is accessible, the developer shall install adequate water facilities, including fire hydrants, according to specifications of the Clayton County Water Authority or as required by the city manager. All water mains shall normally be at least six inches in diameter except that pipe of lesser size may be used if properly looped and adequate water pressure is maintained in accordance with standards established by the Southeastern Fire Underwriters Association. Pipe of less than four inches shall not be used except in unusual cases. Water lines shall be installed at least 30 inches below grade. Water mains within subdivisions and land developments must be provided with connections to each lot in the subdivision and each land development, except as otherwise specifically provided. 
                  (c)  Fire hydrants. Fire hydrants shall be required for all nonresidential land developments and all subdivisions except those permitted to be served by individual on-site wells. Fire hydrants with appropriate water pressure at appropriate intervals throughout the subdivision or land development shall be provided by the subdivider or land developer as required by the county fire department. Fire hydrants shall be located no more than 1,000 feet apart and within 500 feet of any principal dwelling. Hydrants, fittings, valves and fire department connections shall be approved by the fire department. Fire department connections shall be not less than 18 inches or more than 36 inches above the level of the adjoining ground or paving. The thread of such connections shall be uniform with that used by the fire department. To eliminate future street openings, all underground utilities for fire hydrants, together with the fire hydrants themselves, and all other supply improvements shall be installed before any final paving of a street within the right-of-way shared by such underground utilities.

Each subdivision and land development shall be served by adequate sewage disposal facilities. No building permit shall be issued for any building within a subdivision or for the development of land, if there is not present throughout the subdivision or to the land development an adequate system of wastewater collection and treatment. 
                  (b)  Connection to public sewerage system. The subdivider or land developer shall connect with a public sanitary sewerage system and provide sewers accessible to each lot in the subdivision or to each land development. It shall be unlawful for any to maintain upon any such property an individual sewage disposal system. Sanitary sewers shall be located within street or alley rights-of-way unless topography dictates otherwise. No public sewer shall be less than eight inches in diameter. Manholes shall be installed in sanitary sewers with a maximum distance between two manholes of 400 feet, unless otherwise specified by standards of the city manager. Sanitary sewer slopes shall be equal to or greater than seven-tenths percent for eight-inch lines. All sewer lines shall be designed with slopes to obtain a minimum velocity of two feet per second. Minimum 20-foot wide easements shall be provided for all sanitary sewer lines.

                  (a)  Definitions. As used in this chapter: 
                  Alarm signal means a detectible signal, either audible or visual, generated by an alarm system, to which the City of Jonesboro Police Department is expected to respond. 
                  Alarm system means any device or assembly of equipment designed to signal the occurrence of an illegal entry or other event requiring immediate attention and to which the City of Jonesboro Police Department is expected to respond, but does not include alarms installed in motor vehicles or fire alarms. 
                  Alarm systems coordinator means an employee of the Jonesboro Police Department designated by the Chief of Police of the City of Jonesboro, Georgia to administer this chapter. 
                  Alarm user means any person, corporation, partnership, proprietorship, governmental or educational entity or any other entity owning or leasing an alarm system or on whose premises an alarm system is maintained for the protection of such premises. 
                  Automatic dial protection device means an automatic dialing device or an automatic telephone dialing alarm system and shall include any system which, upon being activated, automatically initiates to the Clayton County "911" emergency communications center a recorded message or code signal indicating a need for emergency response. 
                  False alarm means the activation of an alarm system through mechanical or electrical failure, malfunction, improper installation, or the negligence or improper activation by the alarm user, his employees or agents, and false signals activated to summon law enforcement or emergency personnel unless response was canceled by the alarm user or his agent before personnel are dispatched to the alarm location. A false alarm shall not include an alarm which can reasonably be determined to have been caused or activated for the first time by unusual conditions of nature nor does it include other extraordinary circumstances not reasonably subject to the control of the alarm user. In addition, an alarm activated during an alarm system testing procedure shall not be considered a false alarm if the alarm user first notifies and receives permission from the alarm systems coordinator to test the system. An alarm is false within the meaning of this chapter when, upon investigation or inspection by city employees, evidence indicates that no unauthorized entry, burglary, robbery, or such other crime was committed or attempted and no fire or other emergency existed in or on the premises which would have activated a properly functioning alarm system. 
                  (b)  Alarm installations. The installation and alteration of alarm systems shall be in accordance with Article 760 "Fire Protective Signaling Systems" of the National Electrical Code, NFPA Number 70-1975 and the following NFPA standards:

                  (4)  Standards 72-D—Standard for the installation, maintenance, and use of remote station protective signaling systems for watchman, fire alarm and supervisory service; 
                  (5)  Standards 72-E—Standard on automatic fire detectors; and 
                  (6)  Standard 74—Standard for the installation, maintenance and use of household fire warning equipment. 
                  (c)  False alarm determinations. 
                  (1)  Response. Whenever an alarm is activated in the incorporated area of the city and the City of Jonesboro police respond, a city police officer on the scene of the activated alarm system shall inspect the area and determine whether the response was in fact necessary as indicated by the alarm system or whether the alarm was a false alarm. 
                  (2)  Notification. If the city police officer at the scene of the activated alarm system determines the alarm to be false, he shall make a report of the false alarm. The alarm systems coordinator shall be supplied with a copy of each false alarm determination report. The alarm systems coordinator shall in turn, notify the alarm user of the false alarm, and any such civil penalties if appropriate. 
                  (d)  Review of false alarm determinations. 
                  (1)  Request for review. The alarm systems coordinator shall, when requested by an alarm user, review the determination that an alarm was false. Such review shall be conducted by the alarm systems coordinator only if the alarm user requests in writing such a review within ten days of the date the alarm user was notified of the false alarm determination. The written request for review of a false alarm determination by the alarm systems coordinator shall include the following information: 
                  a.  Alarm user name; 
                  b.  Address at which alarm is installed; 
                  c.  Date of false alarm that is being contested; and 
                  d.  Facts upon which the request for review of the false alarm determination is made. 
                  (e)  Penalties. 
                  (1)  Excessive false alarms. It is found and determined that six or more false alarms within any fiscal year of the city are excessive and constitute a public nuisance. 
                  (2)  Civil penalties. 
                  a.  The seventh false alarm within a fiscal year will result in the alarm user being assessed a $50.00 civil penalty. Each such penalty shall be paid within 30 days from date of receipt of the assessment notice. 
                  b.  The eighth false alarm within a fiscal year shall result in the alarm user being assessed a $100.00 civil penalty, which shall be paid within 30 days from receipt of the assessment notice.

                  (3)  Remedy for refusal to pay assessments or to take remedial action. If an alarm user is assessed civil penalties for excessive false alarms and refuses either: (1) to pay the same; or (2) to make immediate remedial action so that excessive false alarms cease, then the city shall be authorized to bring an action in the municipal court of the city to abate the nuisance pursuant to O.C.G.A. Section 41-2-5 and collect the fees. 
                  (f)  Preexisting alarm systems. Alarm systems upon which substantial installation work has already begun on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall not be required to comply with the construction standards required by section 46-22(b), yet such systems shall in all respects be subject to the false alarm, penalty, and other provisions set forth in this chapter.

                  Sec. 54-11. - Garbage collection fees; billing; penalties for late payment. 
                  (a)  For the year calendar 2014 and each succeeding calendar year, a garbage collection fee in an amount set by a fee schedule, as modified from time to time by resolution of the mayor and council, shall be assessed against each residential unit and to the real property owner. The garbage collection fee schedule shall be on file in the office of the city clerk.

Owners of residential units shall be assessed a garbage collection fee for each residential unit on the property. 
                  (c)  The garbage collection fee will appear as a separate line item on the property owner's annual ad valorem tax bill and shall become due and payable in one annual payment at the same time that ad valorem taxes are due and payable. Each year's payment entitles the property owner to garbage collection and disposal service for each residential unit so assessed.

Each annual installment shall become a lien against the residential unit served on January 1 of each year in the same manner and the same priority that a lien attaches for ad valorem taxes. Any garbage collection fee that remains unpaid shall accrue penalty, interest, and fieri facias charges in the same manner and the same rate as delinquent ad valorem taxes. 
                  (e)  In lieu of payment of this garbage collection fee, all properties which are exempt from ad valorem taxes under Georgia law shall be charged and invoiced for all sanitation service received from the city through a monthly bill to the registered address of the owner of such property. The charge for such services shall be determined by the governing authority. 
                  (f)  There shall be no free service offered by the city for garbage collection service. Persons, firms, individuals, corporations or associations of individuals who have their collection service discontinued shall be in violation of this chapter and shall be subject to the penalties set forth in section 54-12 herein. 
                  (g)  Unless requested by the property owner, no garbage collection fee will be charged to vacant lots. Only properties that have thereupon a residential unit shall be charged the garbage collection fee.

                  Sec. 58-73. - Utility registration. 
                  (a)  Registration required. Each utility who occupies, uses or has facilities in the rights-of-way at the time of passage of the ordinance from which this article is derived, including by lease, sublease or assignment, to operate facilities located in the rights-of-way, unless specifically exempted by state or federal law, or this Code, shall file a registration statement with the public works director within 90 days of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived.

                  (1)  The name, legal status (i.e. partnership, corporation, etc.), street address, email address, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the utility filing the registration statement (the "registrant"). If the registrant is not the owner of the facility in the right-of-way, the registration shall include the name, street address, email address, if applicable, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the owner; 
                  (2)  The name, street address, email address, if applicable, and telephone and facsimile numbers of one or more facilities representative(s). Current information regarding how to contact the facilities representative(s) in an emergency shall be provided at the time of filing a registration and shall be updated as necessary to assure accurate contact information is available to the city at all times; 
                  (3)  A copy, if requested, of the utility's certificate of authority (or other acceptable evidence of authority to operate) from the state public service commission and/or the FCC and any other similar approvals, permits, or agreements.

                  (d)  Acceptance of a registration shall not convey title in the rights-of-way. Acceptance of the registration is only the nonexclusive, limited right to occupy rights-of-way in the city for the limited purposes stated in the acceptance. Acceptance of the registration does not excuse the requirement to obtain a proper franchise agreement with the city, whether by contract or by operation of state law. Acceptance of the registration does not excuse a utility from obtaining permits required by city ordinances nor from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before using the facilities of others, including the city. Acceptance of the registration does not excuse a utility from notifying the city of construction as required herein. 
                  (e)  Facilities in place without registration. Beginning one year after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, any facilities or part of a facility found in a right-of-way for which registration is required but has not been obtained unless specifically exempted by law, and for which no valid service agreement exists with the city, may be deemed a nuisance and an unauthorized use of the rights-of-way. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to abating the nuisance; taking possession of the facilities, evicting the utility from the right-of-way; prosecuting the violator; and/or any other remedy provided by city ordinance or otherwise allowed in law or in equity.

                  (8)  A copy, if requested, of the service agreement, if applicable, or other legal instrument that authorizes the utility to use or occupy the right-of-way for the purpose described in the application. 
                  (c)  Permit fees. When applicable, fees shall be determined by the mayor and city council. A fee schedule shall be available at the offices of the director and the city clerk and open for public inspection.

                  (1)  Whether issuing the permit will be consistent with this article; and

                  (1)  Each utility shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, notify the director of any event regarding its facilities which it considers to be an emergency. The utility may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary in order to respond to the emergency. A utility who engages in an emergency excavation shall take all reasonable precautions to avoid or minimize damage to any existing facilities. 
                  (2)  In the event that the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding utility facilities, the city may attempt to contact the affected utility or facilities representative. The city may take whatever action it deems necessary in order to respond to the emergency, including cut or move any of the wires, cables, amplifiers, appliances, or other parts of the facilities.

                  (g)  Cancellation for cause. If a utility fails to cure a default within 20 working days after such notice is provided to the utility by the city, then such default shall be a material breach and the city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity to terminate the permit. If the director decides there is cause or reason to terminate, the following procedure shall be followed: 
                  (1)  City shall serve a utility with a written notice of the reason or cause for proposed termination and shall allow a utility a minimum of 15 calendar days to cure its breach. 
                  (2)  If the utility fails to cure within 15 calendar days, the city may declare the permit terminated. 
                  (h)  Expiration of permit. If work has not begun within six months of the date of issuance, the permit will automatically expire.

                  Sec. 58-75. - Required minimum standards. 
                  (a)  Utility accommodation manual adopted. The 2009 Utility Accommodation Policy and Standards Manual, including all references contained therein to codes, rules, regulations, schedules, forms and appendix items, except appendix B (permit forms and supporting documents), promulgated by the state department of transportation, as may be amended from time to time is hereby adopted by reference and incorporated in this article as if fully set forth herein, subject to the amendments and modifications contained in this article. A copy of the manual shall be maintained at the offices of the director or designee and open for public inspection. Any conflicts between the provisions of this article and the manual shall be resolved in favor of the manual. References to state personnel, agencies, and fees shall be interpreted, where required, as meaning the city municipal equivalents. 
                  (b)  Protection of traffic and roadway. Unless specifically stated on the face of the permit, no utility may occupy the city right-of-way where sufficient space is unavailable so that the free flow and safety of traffic and other capacity considerations are not unduly impaired and the installation does not prevent the city from reasonably maintaining the streets, structures, traffic control devices and other appurtenant facilities, and further provided that maintenance and operations of the facilities do not jeopardize the traffic, street structure, other users of the right-of-way or the right-of-way itself. 
                  (c)  Grading. If the grades or lines of any street within the city right-of-way are changes at any time by the city during the term of the permit and this change involves an area in which the utility's facilities are located, then the utility shall, at its own cost and expense and upon the request of the city upon reasonable notice, protect or promptly alter or relocate the facilities, or any part thereof, so as to conform with such new grades or lines. In the event the utility refuses or neglects to so protect, alter or relocate all or part of the facilities, the city shall have the right to break through, remove, alter or relocate all or any part of the facilities without any liability to the utility and the utility shall pay to the city the costs incurred in connection with such breaking through, removal, alteration, or relocation. 
                  (d)  Installation of poles and other wireholding structures and relocation. Unless otherwise provided in a valid service agreement, no placement of any pole or wireholding structure of the utility is to be considered a vested interest in the right-of-way, and such poles or structures are to be removed, relocated underground, or modified by the utility at its own expense whenever the city determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. The facilities shall be so located and installed as to cause minimum interference with the rights and convenience of property owners. 
                  (e)  Blasting or excavating. As provided in O.C.G.A. § 25-9-6 (Georgia Utility Facility Protection Act) and other applicable state law currently in place or as amended, no utility shall commence, perform, or engage in blasting or in excavating with mechanized excavating facilities unless and until the utility planning the blasting or excavating has given 48 hours' notice by submitting a locate request to the utility protection center, beginning the next working day after such notice is provided, excluding hours during days other than working days. 
                  (f)  [Post-excavation replacement of surfacing material.] Where excavations are to be made in any hard-surfaced or brick-paved streets, all excavations and replacements of surfacing material or paving shall be done by the city at the cost of the person desiring to lay such piping or doing other work therein. The director shall estimate the cost of such work by averaging three solicited quotes, and in all cases the person desiring the doing of the work shall deposit with the city clerk the amount of money necessary to cover its estimated cost before the performance of the work shall commence. Upon the completion of work, the director shall file with the city clerk an itemized statement of the cost of the work and where the cost does not exceed the amount deposited therefor, the balance shall be returned to the permittee.

                  (a)  Each utility shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any facilities in the rights-of-way and adjoining property or other facilities which it or its facilities manage. 
                  (b)  A utility shall be liable, at its own cost and expense, to replace, restore or repair, any street, facilities or property or structure thereon, thereunder, thereover or adjacent thereto that may become disturbed or damaged as a result of the construction or installation, operation, upgrade, repair or removal of facilities to a condition as good as or better than its condition before the word performed by the utility that caused such disturbance or damage. If the utility does not commence such replacement or repair after 20 working days following written notice from the city, the city or the owner of the affected structure or property may make such replacement or repair and the utility shall pay the reasonable and actual cost of the same.

                  (a)  The utility shall make the construction site available to the director or designee and to all others as authorized by law, for inspection at all reasonable times during the execution and upon completion of the construction. 
                  (b)  At any time, including the time of inspection, the director may order the immediate cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the health, safety, or welfare of the public, violates any law, or which violates the terms and conditions of the permit and/or this chapter or issue an order to correct work which does not conform to the permit and/or applicable standards, conditions or codes. 
                  (c)  When the construction under any permit is completed, the utility shall notify the department.

                  Additional permits required. The utility shall obtain all construction, building or other permits or approvals as according to city ordinance, state, or federal law. In addition, a permittee shall comply with all requirements of laws, shall complete work in a way as to not cause any unnecessary or unauthorized obstructions of sidewalks, streets, waterways or railways, and is responsible for all work done in the rights-of-way regardless of who performs the work. No rights-of-way obstruction or excavation may be performed when seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work, except in the case of an emergency as outlined in this article.

                  Every utility, or authorized representative thereof, convicted of a violation of any provision of this article shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000.00 per violation.

In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the city may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief and revocation of licenses or permits.

                  Sec. 58-80. - Miscellaneous provisions. 
                  (a)  Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this article is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. 
                  (b)  Reservation of regulatory and police powers. The city, by issuing a written approval of registration under this article, does not surrender or to any extent lose, waive, impair, or lessen the lawful powers and rights, which it has now or may be hereafter vested in the city under the Constitution and laws of the United States, State of Georgia and the city charter, and under the provisions of this Code to regulate the use of the rights-of-way. The utility, by applying for and being issued a written permit, is deemed to acknowledge that all lawful powers and rights, regulatory power, or police power, or otherwise as are or the same may be from time to time vested in or reserved to the city, shall be in full force and effect and subject to the exercise thereof by the city at any time. A utility is deemed to acknowledge that its interests are subject to the regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public and is deemed to agree to comply with all applicable general laws enacted by the city pursuant to such powers. In particular, all utilities shall comply with city zoning and other land use requirements pertaining to the placement and specification of facilities. 
                  (c)  Compliance. No person shall be relieved of its obligation to comply with any of the provisions of this article by reason of any failure of the city to enforce compliance.

                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 2018-003 , § 1, adopted Jan. 8, 2018, repealed the former art. III, §§ 70-51—70-67, and enacted a new art. III as set out herein. The former art. III pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. of 10-14-1996, § 1(8-8-1—8-8-16); Ord. No. 02-04, §§ 7—9, adopted June 10, 2002; and Ord. No. 05-05, §§ 1, 2, adopted Feb. 14, 2005. 

                  Sec. 70-51. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this article is to establish guidelines and regulations for the siting of all wireless, cellular, television, and radio telecommunications facilities, including all equipment and network components, any underlying support structure, such as antennas, transmitters, receivers, base stations, power supplies, cabling, accessory equipment, or other mechanisms used to provide and or aid the transmission of wireless data, cellular, television, radio, or other telecommunications services. The mayor and council recognize that the city is to provide for the siting of telecommunication facilities, support structures, and antennas pursuant to the mandates of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, as amended. While mandated to make such provisions, the mayor and council also recognize that telecommunications facilities, such as towers and monopoles, telecommunication support structures, and antennas may negatively impact the aesthetic appearance of the city, and may reduce the property value of lots proximately located to such telecommunication support structures, particularly when they are sited adjacent to residential areas. 
                  The goals of this article, therefore, are: 
                  (a)  To encourage the location of telecommunications facilities, including all telecommunication support structures, equipment, and/or antenna(s) in nonresidential areas; 
                  (b)  To promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the public by regulating the siting of and establishing development standards for wireless facilities and related wireless support structures, equipment, and infrastructure; 
                  (c)  To minimize the total number of telecommunication support structures within the community necessary to provide adequate personal wireless services to residents of the city; 
                  (d)  To encourage the joint use of new and existing telecommunication support structure sites among providers; 
                  (e)  To locate telecommunication facilities and antennas in areas where adverse impacts on the community are minimized; 
                  (f)  To encourage the design and construction of telecommunication facilities and antennas in a manner that minimizes adverse visual impacts; 
                  (g)  To follow and promote policies embodied in Section 704 of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 and O.C.G.A. § 36-66B-1, et al., in such a manner as not to unreasonably discriminate between providers of functionally equivalent wireless services or to prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting personal wireless services in the city; 
                  (h)  To encourage the location of telecommunication support structures on municipal property but not in public parks; and 
                  (i)  To enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to deliver such services to the community effectively, efficiently and safely. 
                  (j)  To establish a local policy concerning applications for the erection or modification of telecommunication facilities, including telecommunication support structures, in any public rights-of-way in accordance with the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 and O.C.G.A. §§ 32-4-92 and 46-5-1; permit and manage reasonable access to the city's public rights-of-way for telecommunications purposes on a competitively neutral and non-discriminatory basis; assure the city can continue to fairly and responsibly protect public health, safety, and welfare; promote competition in telecommunications; and establish clear guidelines for applicants seeking a permit with respect to any public rights-of-way.

Lessee acknowledges that the city is also leasing the city property for the purposes of transmitting and receiving telecommunication signals from the city property. The city, however, is not in any way responsible or liable for any interference with lessee's use of the city property which may be caused by the use and operation of any other tenant's equipment, even if caused by new technology. In the event that any other tenant's activities interfere with the lessee's use of the city property, and the lessee cannot work out this interference with the other tenants, the lessee may, upon 60 days' notice to the city, terminate this lease and restore the city property to its original condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted. The lessee shall cooperate with all other tenants to identify the causes of and work towards the resolution of any electronic interference problem. In addition, the lessee agrees to eliminate any radio or television interference caused to city-owned facilities or surrounding residences at lessee's own expense and without installation of extra filters on city-owned equipment. Lessee further agrees to accept such interference as may be received from city-operated telecommunications or other facilities located upon the city property subject to this lease."

                  Sec. 86-4. - Purpose. 
                  This chapter has been prepared in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan of the City of Jonesboro, Georgia, and is established for the purpose of promoting orderly and sustainable development; protecting public health, safety, convenience and welfare; minimizing traffic congestion; ensuring such access, design and density of development and use as will secure safety from fire, panic, and other dangers; providing adequate access to natural light and air; achieving such timing, density, distribution and design of development and use as will facilitate an economic, adequate and timely provision of transportation, communication, water supply, sanitary sewer, drainage, sanitation, educational, police and fire protection, recreational and other public services; protecting existing development and property against blight and depreciation; preventing flooding of improved property; improving the quality of life through protection of Jonesboro's total environment, including prevention of air, land, water, visual and noise pollution; encouraging greater efficiency and economy of land development through natural resource conservation; preventing the overcrowding of land, undue concentration of population and urban sprawl; encouraging the most appropriate use of land, buildings and other structures; achieving such density, dwelling type, design and distribution of housing as will protect and enhance residential property values and facilitate provision of adequate housing; preserve established development patterns and historic district and structures; and for other purposes.

                  A formal review shall be required concerning any proposed use of land prior to issuance of any building permit, or initiation of any improvement, grading or alteration of land or building to determine compliance with all provisions of this chapter.

The city may file in a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain a stop work order, ordered by a judge, which shall be served on the applicant or other responsible person.

                  Sec. 86-73. - Official zoning map adopted. 
                  The land area of the City of Jonesboro, Georgia is hereby divided into zoning districts, as provided herein and as indicated on the official zoning map which, together with all explanatory notations, references and other information indicated thereon, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be an integral part of this chapter. The zoning map, as adopted and as may be amended thereafter by mayor and city council from time to time, establishes the boundaries and location of all zoning districts in the city. The map is prepared by the geographic information services specialist, and is compiled from aerial photography, deed records, plats, and other imagery, data and public records. The primary public information sources should be consulted for verification of information contained on the map. 
                  The official zoning map as adopted at the time of adoption of this zoning ordinance shall be identified as that map bearing the signature of the Mayor of Jonesboro serving at the time of adoption, and attested by the City Clerk of the City of Jonesboro, Georgia, and bear the seal of the city under the following words: "This is to certify that this is the Official Zoning Map referred to in this Section of Ordinance 05-08 of the City of Jonesboro, Georgia," together with the date of adoption of this ordinance. A certified copy of the official zoning map as originally adopted shall be maintained on file as a public record in the office of the city clerk for public inspection and review. 
                  (Ord. No. 05-08, § 2(4.03), 8-15-05; Ord. No. 05-11, Art. 1, 8-15-05) 
                  Sec. 86-74. - Amendments to the official zoning map. 
                  Should changes be made to district boundaries or other matter portrayed on the official zoning map in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and state law, a notation shall be made on the map, indicating such changes promptly following adoption of the implementing ordinance accompanying the map amendment that accomplished such change by the city council. Such amendments shall be recorded in the minutes of the mayor and council and shall be available for public inspection. mayor and council are encouraged to re-adopt the official zoning map periodically, incorporating such notations of map changes as have been accomplished in the past year. 
                  The official zoning map, as adopted by the mayor and city council and amended from time to time by action of that governing body, shall be maintained and available in the office of the city clerk. All zoning district boundary changes and amendments to the zoning map shall be noted on the map maintained in the office of the city clerk with the date of the zoning change or amendment and reference to the implementing ordinance.

                  Sec. 86-76. - Replacement of official zoning map. 
                  In the event the original official zoning map becomes damaged, destroyed or lost, the city council may by resolution adopt a new official zoning map which shall supersede all previous such maps. The new official zoning map may be used to correct errors or omissions in the original official zoning map, but no such correction shall have the effect of amending the original official zoning map or any subsequent amendment thereof. Unless the original official zoning map has been lost or wholly destroyed, the original map or any remaining significant portions thereof shall be preserved, together with all available records pertaining to its adoption or amendment. 
                  (Ord. No. 05-08, § 2(4.06), 8-15-05) 
                  Sec. 86-77. - Determination of zoning district boundaries. 
                  The boundaries of the zoning districts as shown on the official zoning map shall be determined on the basis of legal descriptions or boundary surveys associated with approved zoning applications or, lacking such legal descriptions or surveys, on the basis of the location of the boundaries depicted on the official zoning map. 
                  All property located in the city limits is assigned a zoning district as indicated on the official zoning map, and no property shall be used except in accordance with the zoning district designations on the zoning map and the provisions of this chapter. Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any zoning district shown on the official zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 
                  Where a zoning district boundary is shown as approximately following the centerline of a street, alley, or public right-of-way; land lot line; corporate limit line; railroad right-of-way; militia district line; or a property boundary; or such lines extended, then such lines shall be construed to be the zoning district boundary. 
                  Where a zoning district boundary is shown as being set back from a public street or a railroad right-of-way, and approximately parallel thereto, then such zoning district boundary shall be construed as being the noted distance, or in the absence of such a note, the scaled distance from the centerline of the public street or railroad right-of-way and as being parallel thereto. 
                  Where a zoning district boundary divides a lot, the location of the line shall be the noted distance, or in the absence of such a note, the scaled distance from the lot lines. In such instances, and where the lot was held in single ownership at the time of passage of this chapter, the city manager may approve application of the standards and provisions of the zoning district in which the greater portion of the lot is located to the remaining portion of the lot; however, such application shall not encompass any part of such a lot that lies more than 35 feet beyond the zoning district boundary. 
                  Where a double-frontage or through lot fronting on two different streets is divided by a zoning district boundary approximately paralleling the two streets, the standards and provisions of the zoning districts controlling development along each respective street on which the frontage of the lot is located shall apply to that portion of the lot so divided. 
                  Where a zoning district boundary remains in doubt in particular instances following application of the above rules, the mayor and council shall determine the location of the district boundary.

                  Sec. 86-91. - Conditions of previous zoning approvals retained. 
                  All conditions imposed as conditions of rezoning of property prior to adoption of the official zoning map are hereby retained and reaffirmed, and shall continue in full force and effect until such time as the property is rezoned or the prior zoning action of the mayor and city council is amended through the rezoning process established by article XII of this chapter.

                  Sec. 86-92. - District standards. 
                  Each zoning district contains uses that are permitted "by right," without the need for further zoning approval. Site plan approval or building permit issuance may be required prior to establishment of a use on the property. Accessory uses, that is, uses customarily incidental to the principal use may also be permitted, usually subject to certain restrictions. Conditional uses may be approved in particular zoning districts, subject to certain conditions enforced through the rezoning process. Finally, specific uses are prohibited in all zoning districts.

                  Sec. 86-93. - Permitted uses and accessory uses. 
                  Principal uses that are permitted by right in each zoning district are indicated in section 86-204, Table of uses allowed by zoning district. Accessory uses customarily incidental to principal uses are permitted.

                  Sec. 86-95. - Prohibited uses. 
                  Certain uses are specifically prohibited in all zoning districts. These are indicated in section 86-204, Table of uses allowed by zoning district. 
                  (Ord. No. 05-08, § 2(5.05), 8-15-05) 
                  Sec. 86-96. - Identification of uses. 
                  Uses regulated under this chapter are primarily identified in the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS), United States, 2002, published by the Executive Office of the President Office of Management and Budget. Uses not listed in section 86-204, Table of uses allowed by zoning district, may be approved following an interpretation by the city manager as provided in article II. The NAICS establishes a numbering system for a diverse range of activities. These numbers and the activities referenced are indicated in the tables for each zoning district. The NAICS numbering system is used for reference and interpretation, only; the NAICS is not adopted as part of this chapter.

                  Sec. 86-97. - R-2 single family residential district regulations. 
                  (a)  Purpose. The R-2 single family residential district is established to provide for single family detached dwellings on individual lots having a minimum area of one-half acre. The district is intended to create and preserve a neighborhood setting free of non-residential uses as well as higher density residential uses. Public and institutional uses traditionally found in low density neighborhoods are compatible with the R-2 district. Such development is typically served by a network of local streets to minimize traffic impacts on the neighborhood. 
                  (b)  Development standards. Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, uses permitted in the R-2 district shall conform to the following development standards: 
                  (1)  Minimum lot area: 21,780 square feet (½-acre) 
                  (2)  Minimum lot width: 100 feet 1 
                  (3)  Minimum front yard: 35 feet 2 
                  (4)  Minimum side yard: 15 feet 3 
                  (5)  Minimum rear yard: 35 feet 
                  (6)  Minimum floor area per dwelling unit: 1,600 square feet 
                  (7)  Maximum building height: Two stories and 35 feet 
                  (8)  Maximum lot coverage: 35 percent 
                  1 Measured at the building line. 
                  2 The required front yard on any street classified as a collector or above shall be 40 feet. 
                  3 The minimum side yard on the street side of a corner lot shall be 25 feet. 
                  (c)  Design standards. Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, uses permitted in an R-2 district shall conform to the following design standards: 
                  (1)  Off-street parking shall be provided as specified in article XIII of this chapter. 
                  (2)  Buffers shall be provided as specified in article XV of this chapter.

                  Sec. 86-98. - R-4 single family residential district regulations. 
                  (a)  Purpose. The R-4 single family residential district is established to provide for single family detached dwellings on individual lots having a minimum area of one-quarter acre. The district is intended to create and preserve a neighborhood setting in which smaller lots are desired. While the R-4 district is primarily free of non-residential uses as well as higher density residential uses, the district may adjoin such districts and may be located near the downtown. Public and institutional uses traditionally found in relatively low density neighborhoods are compatible with the R-4 district. Such development is also typically served by a network of local streets to minimize traffic impacts on the neighborhood. 
                  (b)  Development standards. Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, uses permitted in the R-4 district shall conform to the following development standards: 
                  (1)  Minimum lot area: 10,480 square feet (¼-acre) 
                  (2)  Minimum lot width: 75 feet 1 
                  (3)  Minimum front yard: 25 feet 2 
                  (4)  Minimum side yard: 12 feet 3 
                  (5)  Minimum rear yard: 25 feet 
                  (6)  Minimum floor area per dwelling unit: 1,600 square feet 
                  (7)  Maximum building height: Two stories and 35 feet 
                  (8)  Maximum lot coverage: 35 percent 
                  1 Measured at the building line. 
                  2 The required front yard on any street classified as a collector or above shall be 30 feet. 
                  3 The minimum side yard on the street side of a corner lot shall be 20 feet. 
                  (c)  Design standards. Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, uses permitted in an R-4 district shall conform to the following design standards: 
                  (1)  Off-street parking shall be provided as specified in article XIII of this chapter. 
                  (2)  Buffers shall be provided as specified in article XV of this chapter. 
                  (Ord. No. 05-08, § 2(5.08), 8-15-05) 
                  Sec. 86-99. - R-C cluster residential district regulations. 
                  (a)  Purpose. The R-C cluster residential district is established to provide for single family dwellings on relatively small, individual lots having a minimum area of 4,000 square feet. The district is intended to accommodate lifestyles featuring common greenspace adjoining privately owned yards where greenspace amenities are desired. The R-C district is particularly suited to development tracts containing sensitive natural resources such as floodplains, steep slopes or wetlands and promotes preservation of such resources in exchange for somewhat higher lot yields (in the range of 4—6 units per acre) and reduced utility and street lengths. Cluster residential developments are compatible with walkable, neighborhood commercial districts established in close proximity or within the cluster development. 
                  (b)  Development standards. Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, uses permitted in the R-C district shall conform to the following development standards: 
                  (1)  Minimum lot area: 4,000 square feet 
                  (2)  Minimum lot width: 40 feet 1 
                  (3)  Minimum front yard: 20 feet 2 
                  (4)  Minimum side yard: Seven feet 
                  (5)  Minimum rear yard: 20 feet 
                  (6)  Minimum floor area per dwelling unit: 1,400 square feet 
                  (7)  Maximum building height: Two stories and 35 feet 
                  (8)  Maximum density: Six units/acre 
                  (9)  Maximum lot coverage: 40 percent 
                  (10)  Minimum greenspace: 20 percent of gross acreage 
                  1 Measured at the building line. 
                  2 The required front yard on any street classified as a collector or above shall be 25 feet. 
                  (c)  Design standards. Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, uses permitted in an R-C district shall conform to the following design standards: 
                  (1)  Off-street parking shall be provided as specified in article XIII of this chapter. 
                  (2)  Buffers shall be provided as specified in article XV of this chapter. 
                  (3)  A minimum of 50 percent of building lots must adjoin greenspace. 
                  (4)  A homeowners association shall be mandatory with covenants subject to approval by the city manager. 
                  (5)  Greenspace shall be improved with walking trails and an amenity area having a minimum area of 400 square feet with equipment and facilities appropriate to the market served. Greenspace shall have a minimum width of 100 feet; trail connections between greenspace areas shall have a minimum width of 50 feet.

                  Sec. 86-100. - R-A single family attached residential district regulations. 
                  (a)  Purpose. The R-A single family attached residential district is established to provide for single family attached dwellings on individual lots on development tracts having a minimum area of two acres. The district is intended to foster housing options for households seeking high quality home ownership in park like setting featuring attractive architectural styles and building materials. As such, developments facilitated by establishment of the district are restricted to a maximum number of units to limit scale and encourage manageable homeowner associations. The R-A district is compatible with walkable, neighborhood commercial districts and low intensity office and commercial districts and is suited to locations along collector streets. 
                  (b)  Development standards. Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, uses permitted in the R-A district shall conform to the following development standards: 
                  (1)  Minimum tract size: 87,120 square feet (two acres) 
                  (2)  Minimum lot area per unit: 2,400 square feet 
                  (3)  Minimum tract width: 150 feet 1 
                  (4)  Minimum front yard: 20 feet 2

                  Sec. 86-102. - H-1 historic district. 
                  (a)  Purpose of district. The purpose of the H-1 historic district is to provide for retail and residential uses that benefit from close proximity to each other and that will generate pedestrian activity in the city's traditional downtown core. Development and redevelopment in this district is intended to preserve and enhance the historic character of the area while promoting the goals of the Livable Centers Initiative Study. 
                  (b)  Delineation of historic district. The historic district is delineated and duly designated on the official zoning map of the city. Areas located within the historic district must comply with the requirements of this section. 
                  (c)  Required review of exterior changes. Following designation of the H-1 district, no exterior portion of any building or other structure that can be viewed from the public right-of-way (including stone walls, fences, light fixtures, steps and pavement, or other appurtenant features) nor an aboveground utility structure, nor any permanent sign shall be erected, altered, restored or moved within such H-1 district until an application for a certificate of appropriateness as to exterior architectural features and signage has been submitted to and approved by the historic preservation commission. All proposed changes requiring a certificate of appropriateness shall comply with the H-1 design standards found in subsection (l) herein. 
                  (d)  Application for certificate of appropriateness. Application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be made by the owner or owner's agent to the director of downtown development for the city, and the certificate of appropriateness form shall be completed by the director of downtown development within 30 days and presented for review and approval by the historic preservation commission at their scheduled meeting(s). The commission shall vote to approve or deny the certificate upon review of the application, which shall be duly signed by the commission chairperson. 
                  (e)  Exterior architectural feature defined. For purposes of this section, exterior architectural features shall include architectural style, general design, and general arrangement of the exterior of a building or other structure, including the color, the kind and texture of the building material, and the type and style of all windows, doors, light fixtures, signs and other appurtenant features. In the case of outdoor advertising signs, exterior architectural features shall be construed to mean the style, material, and location of all such signs. The commission shall not consider interior arrangement and shall take no action under this section except for the purpose of preventing the construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, or moving of buildings, structures, appurtenant features, or outdoor advertising signs in the historic district that would be incongruous with the historic aspects of the district. 
                  (f)  Certain changes not prohibited. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of a structure in the historic district which does not involve a change in design, material, color, or outer appearance thereof, nor to prevent the construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, or demolition of any such feature which the code enforcement officer or fire marshall shall certify is required by the public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous condition. Such a determination by the code enforcement officer or fire marshall shall be made and documented after an examination of all alternative actions intended to result in the preservation of any feature are exhausted. 
                  (g)  Delay in demolition of historic buildings. Following designation of an historic district, no building or structure therein shall be demolished or otherwise removed until the owner thereof shall have given the historic preservation commission via the director of downtown development's office 120 days' written notice of his proposed action. Upon receiving written notice, the city shall erect a sign on the property to indicate that the building or structure is proposed for demolition. During such 120-day period the historic preservation commission may negotiate with the owner and with any other parties in an effort to find a means of preserving the building. Should the historic preservation commission find that the building involved has no particular historic significance or value toward maintaining the character of the district, it may waive all or part of such 120-day period and authorize earlier demolition or removal. In making a determination of a building's particular historic significance, the historic preservation commission shall refer to the most recent inventory of historic buildings kept on file at the office of downtown development. 
                  (h)  Permitted uses. The following general use classifications are permitted; refer to section 86-204, Table of uses allowed by zoning district, for actual permitted uses:

                  Sec. 86-103. - H-2 historic district. 
                  (a)  Purpose of district. The purpose of the H-2 historic district is to provide for office and commercial uses having a minimal impact on existing residential uses. Development and redevelopment in this district is intended to enhance and preserve the historic character of the area, to encourage thoughtful reuse of historic structures for non-residential purposes, to protect existing low-density residential uses in the district, and to promote the goals of the Livable Centers Initiative Study. 
                  (b)  Delineation of historic district. The historic district is delineated and duly designated on the official zoning map of the city. Areas located within the historic district must comply with the requirements of this section. 
                  (c)  Required review of exterior changes. From and after the designation of the H-2 district, no exterior portion of any building or other structure that can be viewed from the public right-of-way (including stone walls, fences, light fixtures, steps and pavement, or other appurtenant features) nor an aboveground utility structure, nor any type of permanent sign shall be erected, altered, restored or moved within such H-2 district until an application for a certificate of appropriateness as to exterior architectural features and signage has been submitted to and approved by the historic preservation commission. All proposed changes requiring a certificate of appropriateness shall comply with the H-2 design standards found in subsection (l) herein. 
                  (d)  Application for certificate of appropriateness. Application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be made by the owner or owner's agent to the director of downtown development for the city, and the certificate of appropriateness form shall be completed by the director of downtown development within 30 days and presented for review and approval by the historic preservation commission at their scheduled meeting(s). The commission shall vote to approve or deny the certificate upon review of the application, which shall be duly signed by the commission chairperson. 
                  (e)  Exterior architectural feature defined. For purposes of this section, exterior architectural features shall include architectural style, general design, and general arrangement of the exterior of a building or other structure, including the color, the kind and texture of the building material, and the type and style of all windows, doors, light fixtures, signs and other appurtenant features. In the case of outdoor advertising signs, exterior architectural features shall be construed to mean the style, material, and location of all such signs. The commission shall not consider interior arrangement and shall take no action under this section except for the purpose of preventing the construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, or moving of buildings, structures, appurtenant features, or outdoor advertising signs in the historic district that would be incongruous with the historic aspects of the district. 
                  (f)  Certain changes not prohibited. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of a structure in the historic district which does not involve a change in design, material, color, or outer appearance thereof, nor to prevent the construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, or demolition of any such feature which the code enforcement officer or fire marshall shall certify is required by the public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous condition. Such a determination by the code enforcement officer or fire marshall shall be made and documented after an examination of all alternative actions intended to result in the preservation of any feature are exhausted. 
                  (g)  Delay in demolition of historic buildings. From and after the designation of a historic district, no building or structure therein shall be demolished or otherwise removed until the owner thereof shall have given the historic preservation commission via the director of downtown development's office 120 days' written notice of his proposed action. Upon receiving written notice, the city shall erect a sign on the property to indicate that the building or structure is proposed for demolition. During such 120-day period the historic preservation commission may negotiate with the owner and with any other parties in an effort to find a means of preserving the building. Should the historic preservation commission find that the building involved has no particular historic significance or value toward maintaining the character of the district, it may waive all or part of such 90-day period and authorize earlier demolition or removal. In making a determination of a building's particular historic significance, the historic preservation commission shall refer to the most recent inventory of historic buildings kept on file at the office of downtown development.

                  (Ord. No. 05-08, § 2(5.13), 8-15-05) 
                  Sec. 86-104. - MX mixed use district. 
                  (a)  Purpose. MX districts may hereafter be established in accordance with the general procedures and requirements set forth in article XII, Amendments. Such areas are defined as mixed use districts for establishment of complementary groupings of residential, commercial and/or office uses. Such developments as may exist, or may have been previously approved and substantially comply with the intent of these regulations, may be rezoned to MX status and shall thereafter be subject to the regulations of the MX district. 
                  The intent of the MX district is to provide for establishment of such districts at appropriate locations as may be identified on the Future Land Use Map of the City of Jonesboro Comprehensive Plan and are adequately served by the transportation network, including the C-Tran Bus System, and in accordance with standards set forth herein. Uses within mixed use developments shall be integrated to create walkable settings rather than isolated on individual parcels characterizing such development as could occur by traditional zoning. The MX district affords densities that would not other wise be permitted, and in exchange for such density bonuses, architectural style and site design must yield superior public venues. Accordingly, the district mandates appropriately scaled and balanced residential, commercial and office uses located in a manner that minimizes vehicular traffic congestion by providing housing proximate to principal destinations. Convenient pedestrian networks, supported by such amenities as greenspace, trails and paths, furnishings, pedestrian scale lighting and water features are hallmarks of such developments. Site design shall also serve to minimize the role of automobiles by creating deck parking that features streetfront retail or service uses, courtyard parking located in the interior of parcels and other appropriate site designs. 
                  (b)  Development standards. Mixed use districts shall be controlled by the following development standards: 
                  (1)  Site designs and structures shall achieve horizontal and vertical mix of uses. 
                  (2)  Residential uses shall comprise a minimum of 25 percent of the total floor area of an MX district; similarly commercial uses shall also comprise a minimum of 25 percent of the total floor area of an MX district. 
                  (3)  Dwelling units shall not be located on "storefront," that is, the ground floor of any fronting a street. 
                  (4)  Ninety percent of all residential units within a MX district shall be owner-occupied units and such language shall be recorded with the declarations and covenants controlling the development. 
                  (5)  Minimum floor area for attached dwelling units shall be as follows: 
                  a.  One-bedroom units: 900 square feet 
                  b.  Two-bedroom units: 1,200 square feet 
                  c.  Three-bedroom units: 1,400 square feet 
                  (6)  Residential uses shall be located away from major streets and other noise generators such as waste disposal facilities and loading areas to preserve privacy and tranquility. 
                  (7)  Commercial and service uses shall be concentrated for maximum pedestrian convenience and easily accessible to residents of the development as well as employees and visitors. 
                  (8)  Minimum tract size shall be two acres. 
                  (9)  Building setbacks and separation and minimum lot area shall be as proposed and approved on the preliminary site plan. 
                  (10)  A transition from more intense uses as may be located in an MX district to surrounding districts shall be achieved through designs that avoid siting mid and high rise structures or surface parking at the periphery of such developments. Greenspace and low or medium density residential uses shall be situated along common boundaries with any adjacent low density residential uses. 
                  (11)  Landscape buffering may be used when non-residential uses abut residential uses at a common boundary in lieu of siting residential uses at the periphery of the development. Such buffer shall conform to planting standards of article XV and be a minimum of 15 feet in horizontal width; however, shall be increased in width a dimension of ten feet for each story proposed that is greater than the height of residential structures bordering the MX district. 
                  (12)  All outside storage areas shall be located in the rear yard and shall be screened by a solid fence, wall or evergreen landscaping each having a minimum height of eight feet. 
                  (13)  A maximum of 25 percent of the required parking area may front on a public right-of-ways. Site design shall serve to reduce the visibility of these areas and apparent size from public right-of-ways. 
                  (14)  Signs shall be located a minimum of 100 feet from any adjacent residential district and oriented away from such districts. 
                  (c)  Permitted principal uses and structures. Uses permitted in the MX district are presented in section 86-204, Table of uses allowed by zoning district. 
                  (d)  Permitted accessory uses. Uses customarily accessory and clearly incidental to permitted principal uses and structures shall be permitted in this district and are presented in section 86-204, Table of uses allowed by zoning district. Devices used for electrical power generation, such as solar panels, wind generators and similar devices, are also allowed. 
                  (e)  Prohibited uses. Uses prohibited in the MX District are presented in section 86-204, Table of uses allowed by zoning district. No building or structure height or mass greater than that of the Clayton County Courthouse shall be permitted. 
                  (f)  Residential density permitted. Residential density in mixed use structures shall not exceed 24 dwelling units per acre. Density for single family attached structures shall not exceed 12 dwelling units per acre and density for single family detached structures shall not exceed six dwelling units per acre. 
                  (g)  Off-street parking and loading requirements. Off-street parking shall be provided as specified in Article XIII of this chapter. Off-street parking shall be provided as follows: 
                  (1)  Residential uses: Two spaces per dwelling unit for single family detached and single family attached structures; 1½ spaces per dwelling unit for dwellings in mixed use structures. 
                  (2)  Recreational establishments: One per 400 square feet of floor area. 
                  (3)  Restaurants: One per 100 square feet of floor area available to the public. 
                  (4)  Retail uses: One per 300 square feet of floor area available to the public. 
                  (5)  Office uses: One per 250 square feet of floor area. 
                  (6)  Accessory outdoor dining: One per 200 square feet of dining area. 
                  (h)  Site planning. In addition to the standards of review of the ordinance contained in article XII, the following criteria shall be used to evaluate the merits of proposals for MX district zoning. 
                  (1)  Compatibility of the MX district with surrounding context. MX districts may be appropriate at the margin of single family detached neighborhoods; however, the district is not contemplated for locations within such neighborhoods. Development standards in rendering the proposed development compatible with the context. 
                  (2)  Consistency with the comprehensive plan. The future land use map identifies appropriate locations for mixed use development. This document will guide the approval of any MX district application. 
                  (3)  Architectural style and quality. The MX district conveys site design and development intensity not available in traditional zoning districts. Architectural style and the quality of building materials are expected to be superior to projects that may not enjoy such development rights. Construction consistent with high-quality environments seen in the region's premier mixed use locales will be sought in the MX district. 
                  (4)  Integration of uses. Atlanta Regional Commission has defined mixed use as "a mix of uses is the practice of providing a number of uses in proximity to create lifestyle or transportation benefits through increasing the opportunities for walking, biking or using transit." The MX district is established to promote walkable developments where residential uses are incorporated with commercial uses in a manner that invites use of nearby and facilities and services. Designs and development scale that reinforce such integration are preferable to those that isolate residential uses from convenience services and employment opportunities. At the same time, retail and service establishments should be grouped for maximum pedestrian convenience in locations uninterrupted by residential or office occupancies. Such objectives may also be achieved by vertical separation of residential and office uses from retail and service areas to preserve the street level tradition of the latter uses. 
                  (5)  Appropriate relationships of uses. MX site plans shall provide for the safe, efficient, convenient and harmonious grouping of structures, uses, facilities and greenspace. Such provisions shall facilitate pedestrian travel among major destinations within and adjacent to the district with a minimum of conflicts with vehicles. 
                  (6)  Pedestrian and greenspace network. Pedestrian ways through buildings shall relate to a network of greenspaces reserved for pedestrian use. Interior and exterior pedestrian ways shall be scaled appropriately to the anticipated foot traffic volumes and form a convenient network linking major concentrations of uses within the district, and shall connect to C-Tran transit stops, both within and at the edge of the district. 
                  (7)  Streets, parking facilities and service areas. Streets, parking facilities and service areas shall be located and designed to segregate vehicles from pedestrian focal points and gathering areas. Such segregation may be horizontal, with vehicular areas grouped in logical locations or locations at edge of the MX district and adjacent to major streets, or achieved vertically in decks above the street level. 
                  (i)  Procedure for establishment of an MX district. Preliminary site plan, architecturals and project description. The owner or owners of the entire tract of land proposed to be included in the MX district shall file an application for rezoning.

                  Sec. 86-106. - C-1 neighborhood commercial district. 
                  (a)  Purpose. The C-1 neighborhood commercial district is established to promote development of limited commercial and service establishments in close proximity to the neighborhoods they are intended to serve. Beyond limiting the range of permitted uses and the scale of individual buildings, the extent of the neighborhood commercial district itself is to be limited to ensure that consumer demand is not generated from outside the immediate neighborhood and that commercial encroachment into the neighborhood does not occur. Parking standards are relaxed to encourage walking, and pedestrian amenities are required to create and enhance a neighborhood atmosphere. The C-1 district is envisioned as a destination environment in which shoppers may access a variety of goods and services, particularly entertainment services such as restaurants. Uses that foster "one-stop" shopping such as auto parts stores are prohibited as are site plans that feature extensive parking along the right-of-way. 
                  (b)  Development standards. 
                  (1)  Minimum lot area: 43,560 square feet (one acre)

                  Sec. 86-107. - C-2 highway commercial district. 
                  (a)  Purpose. The C-2 highway commercial district is established to accommodate intense retail and service commercial uses along Jonesboro's arterial highways. A broad range of such uses anticipates traffic from surrounding areas traveling through the city and affords a broad segment of the business community access to the large customer volumes associated with such locations. The automobile is the principal means of transit for shoppers in this district, and convenient on-premises parking is a primary concern. Given the value of arterial locations intended to capture heavy retail traffic, such industrial uses as manufacturing, distribution and processing are prohibited in order to reserve high visibility and enhanced access locations for highway commercial uses. 
                  (b)  Development standards. 
                  (1)  Minimum lot area: 43,560 square feet (one acre)

                  Sec. 86-108. - M-1 light industrial district. 
                  (a)  Purpose. The M-1 light industrial district is established to provide for manufacturing uses having a minimal impact on the environment and surrounding land uses. The district is intended to attract a complementary mix of assembly, fabricating, distribution and warehousing, service and wholesale operations. A goal of the light industrial district is to provide architectural and site design standards that encourage development of such uses in a park setting; office components are encouraged through development incentives. 
                  Uses that require significant infrastructure and transportation systems or substantial outdoor storage; create products in large unit sizes; utilize heavy equipment and massive production facilities; or are associated with hazardous materials, significant noise, heat, vibration or refuse generation are prohibited. 
                  (b)  Development standards.

                  (Ord. No. 05-08, § 2(5.19), 8-15-05; Ord. No. 2014-002, § 1, 2-10-2014; Ord. No. 2015-008b, § 1, 8-10-2015) 
                  Sec. 86-110. - Assembly overlay. 
                  (a)  Purpose. The purpose of the assembly overlay is to accommodate the beneficial development of "places of assembly" as defined in section 86-62, Definitions, and appropriately regulate such uses in a non-discriminatory manner. The express intention of mayor and council in the event of any ambiguity in the language of this section mandates that the administration and city staff interpret this section in a manner that best complies with all applicable federal laws, including, but not limited to, 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000cc et seq. 
                  (b)  Applicability. The assembly overlay establishes the parameters within which places of assembly may be established and operated. The assembly overlay supplements zoning regulations set forth by the underlying or base zoning assigned to properties on the official zoning map that control the use and development of those properties. Unless otherwise provided, the legal use of property as defined by the underlying zoning district may continue. Standards set forth in this section shall control over any underlying district regulations. Development regulations not addressed in this section as provided by the underlying zoning classification shall control unless modified by mayor and council as a condition of assignment of the assembly overlay to a particular property. 
                  (c)  Geography. Assignment of the assembly overlay is as depicted graphically on the official zoning map. Properties included in the assembly overlay shall be shown on this map and shall include any property subsequently so designated by mayor and council. 
                  (d)  Administrative approval of compliant places of assembly. Applications for establishment of places of assembly that comply with the regulations set forth in this section may be approved administratively by the code enforcement officer. In considering the appropriateness of an approval of a place of assembly, the code enforcement officer shall apply the standards contained in article XII, section 86-374. Standards of review for map amendments of the Jonesboro Zoning Ordinance and the potential impacts on surrounding development, operating schedule, parking demand relative to supply and peak traffic impacts. Applications that do not comply with these regulations may be approved by mayor and council as a conditional use. 
                  (e)  Mayor and council approval of non-compliant places of assembly. Places of assembly can exert extraordinary demands upon public services and facilities, particularly when established within certain timeframes or in certain locations. Accordingly, applications for places of assembly that do not comply with the assembly overlay regulations may only be established upon approval of a conditional use by mayor and council. The approval process pertaining to places of assembly shall be that assigned conditional uses as described in article VI, Conditional uses. In determining whether an application for such conditional use shall be approved at a particular location, mayor and council shall apply the standards contained in article XII, section 86-374 of the Jonesboro Zoning Ordinance. Mayor and council shall also consider the potential impacts on surrounding development, noise impacts, peak traffic impacts and demand on public services and facilities. Upon a finding that a particular assembly use would conform to the intent and requirements of this section, the application may be approved by mayor and council as a conditional use. Based upon particular circumstances associated with a proposed assembly use at a specific location, mayor and council may attach conditions to the approval that are designed to minimize potential negative impacts and burdens on public facilities and services as well as surrounding properties and travelers on public streets and sidewalks. 
                  (f)  Characterization of places of assembly as concerns scale. Places of assembly are hereby characterized as either "large places of assembly" or "small places of assembly." This characterization is designed to ensure that proposals for establishment of places of assembly are compatible with the scale, use and intensity of surrounding development and may be accommodated by available public infrastructure and services. For purposes of this section "large places of assembly" are defined as those premises or facilities designed to accommodate 50 or more persons at any given time; "small places of assembly" are defined as those premises or facilities designed to accommodate fewer than 50 at any given time. Capacity shall be as measured by the premises or facility occupancy, including indoor and outdoor spaces available to participants, as determined by the fire marshall. 
                  (g)  Standards for establishment of all places of assembly. The following development standards shall apply to any place of assembly. 
                  (1)  Parking and loading regulations. Parking and loading shall be as specified in article XIII, Parking, loading and interior circulation. No parking shall be established within 25 feet of a lot that is zoned residential or containing a residential use. 
                  (2)  Fire and life safety compliance. No permit for establishment of a place of assembly shall be granted prior to an inspection and approval for compliance with all fire and life safety codes by the fire marshall. 
                  (3)  Places of assembly may not be established on lots with zero lot line development or parking in common. Because of the potential noise impacts and peak parking demand, places of assembly shall not be established on properties that share a common wall with adjoining tenant spaces or properties. Similarly, because of the peak parking demand associated with such uses, places of assembly shall not be established on properties that share a common parking area. 
                  (4)  Street network. The potential for creating traffic congestion during peak periods and for excessive on-street parking during peak periods is substantial. Therefore, no assembly use shall be permitted on a lot accessed by a local street as defined by the City of Jonesboro Thoroughfare Plan. Assembly uses shall only be permitted on roadways classified as "major collector street" or roadways having greater capacity as defined by the City of Jonesboro Thoroughfare Plan. 
                  (5)  Buffers. The potential for adverse visual impacts such as glare and noise impacts on adjoining and nearby residential uses by assembly uses is substantial. Therefore, buffers are required for the protection of adjoining residential properties. A natural or manmade, landscaped buffer in compliance with section 86-457. Landscape strip planting requirements of this chapter and the following schedule shall be maintained along the boundary of any property designated as an assembly overlay that abuts property on which a residential use is established or property zoned for residential use: 
                  a.  Residential uses or districts. A buffer having a minimum horizontal dimension of 30 feet shall be established, provided such buffer may be reduced to 25 feet where a berm having a minimum height of three feet is created. 
                  b.  Buffers shall be permanently maintained as indicated on the approved site plan, subject to inspection by the code enforcement officer, and consistent with any other property improvement. The dimension of the buffer shall not be in addition to any other landscaping requirements of this chapter. As the purpose of the buffer is to visually screen and distance uses of the assembly overlay from adjoining uses, one-half of all plant materials shall consist of one or more species that retain foliage throughout the year. Provision of opaque fencing, though desirable, shall not decrease the horizontal dimension of the required buffer. 
                  (h)  Standards for establishment of large places of assembly. The following development standards shall apply to large places of assembly. 
                  (1)  Area regulations. 
                  a.  Minimum lot area. The minimum lot area required for establishment of a large place of assembly shall be two acres. 
                  b.  Minimum lot width. The minimum lot width required for establishment of a large place of assembly shall be 200 feet. 
                  c.  Minimum front yard. None.

                  g.  Maximum ground coverage by buildings and impervious surfaces. Ninety percent. 
                  (2)  Height regulations. The maximum height for buildings abutting a residential district or use shall be three stories or 35 feet as measured at any point 30 feet from any common property line. Building height may be increased one foot for every additional foot beyond a distance of 30 feet from any common property line. No building shall exceed a height of 75 feet. 
                  (i)  Standards for establishment of small places of assembly. The following development standards shall apply to small places of assembly. 
                  (1)  Area regulations. 
                  a.  Minimum lot area. The minimum lot area required for establishment of a small place of assembly shall be one-half-acre. 
                  b.  Minimum lot width. The minimum lot width required for establishment of a small place of assembly shall be 100 feet. 
                  c.  Minimum front yard. The lesser of 25 feet or the average front yard setback of any dwellings within 100 feet of the assembly lot on the same block face. 
                  d.  Minimum rear yard. Ten feet; 30 feet when abutting a residential district or use. 
                  e.  Minimum side yard on street side of a corner lot. None. 
                  f.  Minimum side yard. Five feet; 30 feet when abutting a residential district or use. 
                  g.  Maximum ground coverage by buildings and impervious surfaces. Seventy percent. 
                  (2)  Height regulations. The maximum height for buildings abutting a residential district or use shall be three stories or 35 feet as measured at any point 30 feet from any common property line. Building height may be increased one foot for every additional foot beyond a distance of 30 feet from any common property line. No building shall exceed a height of 45 feet. 
                  (j)  Existing place of assembly uses. No assembly use existing as of the date of adoption of this chapter and designated on the official zoning map shall become a nonconforming use as a result of adoption of this article. 
                  (Ord. No. 05-08, § 2(5.20), 8-15-05; Ord. No. 2014-003, § 1, 6-9-2014) 
                  Sec. 86-111. - Historic residential overlay. 
                  (a)  Purpose. The purpose of the historic residential overlay is to protect and enhance the character of the city's historic neighborhoods by establishing architectural standards for regulation of exterior rehabilitation and new construction. The City of Jonesboro is committed to preserving its historic structures and the special character of the historic neighborhoods. These neighborhoods reflect a variety of architectural styles that have contributed to the city's historic built environment. 
                  (b)  Applicability. The City of Jonesboro has been organized into several historic property groups, (1) the National Register District shall be subject to the provisions of the H-1 or H-2 zoning districts, as appropriate; (2) historic residential properties located within the historic residential overlay shall be subject to the provisions of the historic residential overlay and the provisions of article VII (3) historic commercial properties located within the historic residential overlay shall be subject to the architectural standards of the H-2 district found in subsection 86-103(l), Design standards; and (4) residential properties found outside the National Register District and the historic residential overlay shall be subject to the provisions of article VII. 
                  The historic residential overlay supplements zoning regulations that control the use and development of properties in the overlay. These supplemental regulations focus on architectural standards designed to protect and enhance the historic residential structures and character of properties encompassed in the overlay. Land and buildings within the overlay shall continue to be used in accordance with standards of the underlying zoning district. Where any part of this article conflicts with other standards of this zoning ordinance, the more restrictive standard shall control. 
                  (c)  Geography. The geography of the historic residential overlay is defined as residential properties that have been determined by the city to have historical significance based on architectural style and building age. The overlay is depicted graphically on the official zoning map. 
                  (d)  Scope. The historic residential overlay shall control all rehabilitation or modification to exterior portions of any building or other structure visible from the public right-of-way (including stone walls, fences, light fixtures, steps and pavements, or other appurtenant features), as well as new construction, including additions to existing buildings. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of a structure in the overlay which does not involve a change in design, material, color, or outer appearance thereof. 
                  (e)  Required review of exterior changes. No exterior portion of any building or other structure visible from the public right-of-way (including stone walls, fences, light fixtures, steps and pavement, or other appurtenant features) shall be erected, altered, restored or moved within the overlay until an application for a certificate of appropriateness as to exterior architectural features has been submitted to and approved by the historic preservation commission. The commission shall not consider interior arrangement and shall take no action under this section except for the purpose of preventing the construction, reconstruction, alteration, restoration, or moving of buildings, structures, or appurtenant features in the overlay which would be incongruous with its historic aspects. All proposed changes requiring a certificate of appropriateness shall comply with the architectural design standards of subsection (g) below. 
                  (f)  Application for certificate of appropriateness. Applications for a certificate of appropriateness shall be made by the owner or owner's agent to the director of downtown development for the city, and the certificate of appropriateness form shall be completed by the director of downtown development within 30 days and presented for review and approval by the historic preservation commission at their scheduled meeting(s). The commission shall vote to approve or deny the certificate upon review of the application, which shall be duly signed by the commission chairperson. 
                  (g)  Architectural design standards. The following standards shall control renovation, new construction and development in the historic residential overlay: 
                  (1)  Rehabilitation. Careful maintenance of the existing historic design, materials and details of structures in the overlay is encouraged.

                  ARTICLE VII. - ARCHITECTURAL STYLE AND SCALE 

                  Sec. 86-221. - Purpose. 
                  The City of Jonesboro seeks to preserve the character of this historic community. Such character is derived from architectural style, materials, scale and building siting. This ordinance classifies those architectural styles and materials typical of Jonesboro for the purpose of guiding new residential construction and renovation. Building scale and siting on the lot also influence the character of a neighborhood. Standards employed in controlling the scale and bulk of a structure involve maximum floor area and maximum height, and those that control siting, the position of the structure on the lot, concern setback. This article is established to regulate each of these parameters to ensure that the integrity of Jonesboro's established neighborhoods is preserved, to maintain high quality in construction and to protect real estate values. 
                  (Ord. No. 05-08, § 2(7.01), 8-15-05) 
                  Sec. 86-222. - Applicability. 
                  These standards shall apply to all new single family detached construction and renovation in the City of Jonesboro. Historic residential properties within the historic residential overlay shall conform to the architectural styles of this section and the provision of the overlay. Historic properties outside the overlay are encouraged to comply with these styles and the guidelines of the overlay.

                  Sec. 86-223. - Jonesboro architectural styles influencing residential construction. 
                  New single family detached construction shall be guided by the architectural styles of this section. Seven traditional dwelling types, or architectural styles, are found throughout Jonesboro's historic neighborhoods and comprise the styles the city deems appropriate for new construction. These seven dwelling types are as follows: 
                  •  Folk Victorian 
                  •  Colonial Revival 
                  •  English Vernacular 
                  •  Greek Revival 
                  •  Queen Anne 
                  •  Bungalow 
                  •  Gabled El 
                  These styles, or elements of these styles, shall guide new construction to ensure that residential development reflects the city's architectural history and complements the established character of Jonesboro's neighborhoods. New construction need not mimic the prescribed styles in their entirety; however, distinctive elements shall be reflected in proposed construction. Figures 1 through 7 illustrate each style and their predominant features. Ranch-style houses have been excluded from the acceptable styles for new construction; however, new construction proposed in an established neighborhood comprised primarily of single story, Ranch-style houses may reflect one of the seven acceptable styles or the Ranch style. 
                  Suggested housing styles:

                  Maximum heated floor area of "infill" development shall not exceed 150 percent of the average heated floor area of single family detached dwellings located on the same street for a distance of 600 feet in either direction and situated on both frontages. Such development shall be defined as construction or renovation of single family detached dwellings on lots of record or newly platted lots within a subdivision served by a new street or streets where a majority of the land located within a 600-foot radius of such subdivision is developed in such single family use.

                  Sec. 86-225. - Maximum building height. 
                  The maximum building height for infill development shall be determined by the maximum building height of single family detached dwellings located on the same street for a distance of 600 feet in either direction. That is, infill development in neighborhoods characterized by single story dwellings shall also be single story, and so on.

                  In cases where the front yard setback of single family detached dwellings on the two adjoining lots having frontage on the same street is less than that required in the zoning district, the average setback of the four dwellings shall be used to determine the setback applicable to the lot proposed for infill construction. In no event shall the front yard setback be less than ten feet as measured from the front property boundary.

                  All residential and commercial construction shall be brick, concrete stucco, stone, cementitious siding, wood or similar, durable architectural materials. Vinyl siding may be permitted in residential applications, only, provided the grade of vinyl meets or exceeds the Standard Specification for Rigid PVC Siding (ASTM D-3679). All manufacturers' recommendations concerning vinyl siding installation must be closely followed. 
                  Vinyl siding is prohibited in the H-1 and H-2 historic districts and the historic overlay. Owners of structures within these districts or the overlay having vinyl siding are not required to replace such siding; however, renovation of or addition to any structure having a construction cost exceeding 50 percent of the assessed market value shall comply with this section. That is, the use of vinyl on the structure being renovated or the addition shall be prohibited. 
                  Synthetic stucco may also be permitted, provided the materials and installation fully comply with the standards of this section. "Super" brick, split-faced block, concrete masonry units, cinder blocks and textured block are prohibited with the exception of use in foundation construction. Materials found to be other than durable construction products are specifically prohibited.

                  Sec. 86-241. - Purpose. 
                  Siting of structures on individual building lots and the method of development of properties in an urban context such as Jonesboro can have significant impacts on surrounding properties and the community. A site plan review process can ensure that these impacts are considered during development permitting or property rezoning. The purpose of this section is to ensure appropriate development of private property to protect the community from depreciating effects of uncontrolled site development and to mitigate potentially adverse impacts on surrounding properties and public right-of-ways. These purposes will be pursued through implementation of a site plan review process.

                  Sec. 86-242. - Applicability. 
                  Site plan approval shall be enforced as a condition of zoning approval or development permitting, as appropriate, and shall be applicable to all single family attached development not involving subdivision of land, all multifamily, commercial, industrial development and all other non-residential development. The platting process shall control development on tracts proposed for subdivision and, therefore, such developments are not subject to site plan approval as a condition of zoning.

                  Site plan regulations and procedures as provided in this article are hereby adopted for rezoning of property and development and construction permitting within the city limits of Jonesboro and are established in addition to other provisions of this chapter. Applications for rezoning or development permits in an R-A (condominium development, only), RM, H-1, H-2, O-I, C-1, C-2 and M-1 district shall be accompanied by a site plan. The site plan shall be part of such applications. 
                  Certain documents presented at the public hearing at which time the zoning approval was granted shall be made a part of the rezoning ordinance, adopted with the rezoning as an exhibit.

A hardship may also be associated with building renovation or refitting, necessitating the temporary relocation of fixtures, furnishings or equipment. A construction hardship may also be associated with new construction where new space to be provided by such construction is needed on a more immediate basis. 
                  A permit for installation of a manufactured unit associated with a construction hardship may be issued under the following circumstances and subject to the following conditions: 
                  (1)  A manufactured unit may be stored and occupied on property in any non-residential zoning district for which a building permit or permits have been issued and the primary function of the unit is temporary offices, storage space or related purposes, subject to approval by the code enforcement officer. Storage of such units on residentially zoned property shall be permitted only in conjunction with site construction. 
                  (2)  A maximum of one manufactured unit for each acre of land shall be permitted as a temporary structure, provided that a maximum of three such units shall be permitted on any property. 
                  (3)  Location of all such manufactured units shall comply with the building setbacks of the most restrictive adjoining zoning district. 
                  (4)  All such manufactured units shall be completely removed from the premises within 30 days of completion of construction and prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy pertaining to the building associated with the construction hardship, provided however, that no such unit shall be permitted on the premise for a period exceeding one year. 
                  A permit for the placement of a P.O.D.S. unit associated with a construction hardship may be issued under the following circumstances and subject to the following conditions: 
                  (1)  A P.O.D.S. unit may be placed on property in any non-residential zoning district for which a building permit or permits have been issued and the primary function of the unit is temporary storage space, subject to approval by the code enforcement officer. Storage of such units on residentially zoned property shall be prohibited. 
                  (2)  The property owner or contractor shall submit a site plan subject to approval by the code enforcement officer demonstrating compliance with the building setback of the most restrictive adjoining zoning district.

Nonconforming uses that continue may flourish in an environment that prohibits other such uses. As such, public policy objectives may not be achieved over considerable time periods. Accordingly, amortization of nonconforming uses through such means as limitations on repair or reconstruction following damage are deemed appropriate. It is the further intent of this article that such ordinance compliance as may be reasonable shall be enforced and that nonconformance shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor shall nonconformance be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same zoning district. 
                  (Ord. No. 05-08, § 2(10.1), 8-15-05) 
                  Sec. 86-312. - Applicability. 
                  These regulations apply to the lawful use of a lot or building that does not comply with all of regulations of this chapter governing the use of property at particular locations. Nonconforming use provisions accommodate the continued use of property that was legal at the time the use was established. Such uses may be, and typically are, conducted in a building that is also rendered nonconforming. Property owners may have established vested rights in such instances by investing capital in property in reliance upon adopted ordinances. Zoning laws are not intended to be applied retroactively, or to create individual hardship; however, these laws are adopted to allow the use of land, buildings or structures to continue, subject to restrictions contained in this article. This article is established to prevent such hardships as may be reasonably avoided and not in conflict with the general welfare of the city, or the purposes of this chapter. 
                  Importantly, retention of nonconforming status is dependent upon actual and continuous use of property. Temporary or intermittent use of property that is nonconforming may not be permitted under this article, as any hardship on the individual may not be substantial relative to the impact on the general welfare of the city and the purposes of this chapter. 
                  Nonconforming uses must comply with environmental laws, building codes and other regulations provided that such compliance does not render the continued use infeasible or uneconomic. Nonconformance also applies to building lots and the prior use of a lot with respect to area, setback and off-street parking facilities and shall also be subject to this section. 
                  (Ord. No. 05-08, § 2(10.2), 8-15-05) 
                  Sec. 86-313. - Nonconforming uses of land, or land with minor structures only, permitted. 
                  The lawful use of land existing at the time of adoption of this chapter that does not conform to the provisions of this chapter may be continued, provided the use remains otherwise lawful and complies with section 86-311 and the following provisions: 
                  (1)  Nonconforming uses involving no permanent individual structure with a fixed foundation, may be continued for a period of not more than two years following the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter creating the nonconforming status, provided the use remains otherwise lawful and complies with the provisions of this section. 
                  At the expiration of the above-prescribed two-year period, the nonconforming use of land shall cease, and the land shall thereafter be used only for purposes permitted in the zoning district in which they are located, as established by this chapter. 
                  (2)  No such nonconforming use of land or land with minor structures shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter. For the purposes of this subsection, minor structures shall be defined as structure having a replacement cost of less than $10,000.00. 
                  (3)  Removal or destruction of a minor structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land and the structure shall not thereafter be re-established. For the purposes of this subsection, "destruction," shall be defined as damage totaling more than 50 percent of the replacement cost of the structure at the time of such destruction. 
                  (4)  Structures incurring damage totaling 50 percent or less of replacement cost may be restored on the same building footprint or to a smaller size; provided however, that restoration shall begin within six months of damage and be diligently advanced to completion; and such nonconforming use may be resumed and continued as before, or on a smaller scale, but shall not be enlarged, nor intensified. Unless restoration is so initiated and completed, the use shall terminate and shall not be resumed. 
                  (5)  Remodeling of a minor structure shall not be permitted. 
                  (6)  No such nonconforming use shall be moved wholly or partially onto any portion of a lot other than that portion occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter. 
                  (7)  Cessation of any such nonconforming use of land for any reason for a period exceeding six months, despite the intent of the owner as defined herein, shall comprise a forfeiture of nonconforming status and any subsequent use of land shall conform to the standards of this chapter. 
                  (8)  No additional nonconforming structure shall be erected or moved to a lot in conjunction with such nonconforming use of land. 
                  (9)  All nonconforming fences shall be brought into conformance with this chapter within 18 months of the date of adoption of this chapter.

                  Sec. 86-314. - Nonconforming use of major structures or land occupied by major structures permitted. 
                  The lawful use of individual structures having a replacement cost of $10,000.00 or more, or land in combination with such structures, existing at the time of adoption of this chapter that does not conform to the provisions of this chapter may be continued, provided the use remains otherwise lawful and complies with the following provisions: 
                  (1)  No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter in the district in which the structure is located shall be enlarged, expanded, extended, moved, constructed, reconstructed, structurally altered or otherwise altered except in converting the use of the structure to a use permitted in the zoning district in which the structure is located. 
                  (2)  Alterations may be made to the interior of a nonconforming building, and cosmetic alterations may be made to the exterior of such a building; however, no alterations or extensions shall be made which increase the exterior dimensions of a nonconforming building. 
                  (3)  No nonconforming land use may be enlarged, expanded, relocated on the property or otherwise altered in any manner that increases the degree of nonconformance. 
                  (4)  While the general intent to prohibit expansion of nonconforming uses set forth in section 86-311 is reaffirmed, where indefinite continuation of nonconforming uses in major permanent structures with fixed foundations and with replacement costs exceeding $10,000.00 is apparent, such continuation is hereby found to be adverse to the general public interest. 
                  (5)  A nonconforming use may be extended within the confines of a building manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, provided that such extension in a multi-unit structure shall be confined to the units in use at that time. No such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building. 
                  (6)  Any major structure in or on which a nonconforming use is replaced by a permitted use shall thereafter conform to the standards of the zoning district in which the structure is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed. 
                  (7)  Cessation of a nonconforming use for any reason for a period exceeding 12 consecutive months or a total of 18 months within a three-year period, despite the intent of the owner as defined herein, shall comprise a forfeiture of nonconforming status. Such nonconforming use shall not thereafter be resumed and any future use shall conform to the standards of the zoning district in which the use is located and other provisions of this chapter. Such restrictions shall not apply to cessation as a direct result of public agency action impeding access to the premises. 
                  (8)  Removal or destruction of a major structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land and the structure shall not thereafter be re-established. For the purpose of this subsection, "destruction," shall be defined as damage totaling more than 50 percent of the replacement cost of the structure at the time of such destruction. 
                  (9)  A nonconforming building may be restored following damage or destruction by accidental or unintentional fire, flood, wind or other such causes, provided construction costs do not exceed 50 percent of the replacement cost of such building. Such restoration may be on the same building footprint and floor area as the original structure existing immediately prior to such damage or destruction or to a smaller size provided; however, that required permits for such restoration or replacement are secured and restoration or replacement is initiated within a period of one year from the date of the damage or destruction, and provided further that such restoration or replacement complies, to the extent physically feasible, with current building and zoning code structural and dimensional requirements. Restoration shall be diligently carried to completion and such nonconforming use may be resumed and continued as before, or on a smaller scale, but shall not be enlarged, nor intensified. Unless restoration is so initiated and completed, the use shall terminate and not be resumed. Remodeling shall not be deemed removal or destruction, nor shall destruction necessitated by repairs, maintenance or remodeling.

                  A structure or portion of a structure declared unsafe by any official charged with protecting public safety may be restored to a safe condition, provided such construction costs do not exceed 50 percent of the replacement cost of such structure. The burden of proof as to cost ratio shall be the responsibility of the owner.

                  Sec. 86-316. - Replacement cost. 
                  Replacement cost is defined for the purposes of this article as the cost of re-construction of a building as determined by a certified architect or engineer licensed to practice in Georgia. This cost may or may not be comparable to property appraisals or tax assessments made prior to the damage or destruction necessitating repair or re-construction. Determination of replacement cost shall be the sole responsibility of the owner or applicant.

                  To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this article shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building for which a building permit has been issued and on which construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, and upon which actual building construction has been diligently advanced. "actual construction" is hereby defined as the placing of construction materials in a permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. excavation, demolition or removal of an existing building which has been substantially begun in preparation for such building or rebuilding shall be deemed actual construction provided that work shall be pursued diligently.

                  The intent of any owner or any occupant of a building or land, and any evidence thereof, as concerns discontinuance or abandonment of a nonconforming use shall be irrelevant in determining whether actual discontinuance or abandonment has occurred. Rather, the determination of such discontinuance or abandonment shall be based solely upon such objective evidence as would lead a reasonable observer of actual use of the building or land to believe that discontinuance or abandonment of the use has occurred.

                  Sec. 86-322. - Zoning district boundary changes. 
                  The provisions of this article shall apply to any nonconforming uses created by an amendment to the boundaries of a zoning district that assigns a different zoning classification to an individual property.

                  Sec. 86-323. - Nonconforming building lot. 
                  The regulations and requirements applying to any lot of record existing at the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter which does not comply with the minimum standards of the zoning district in which the lot is located shall be as provided below: 
                  (1)  Any lots of record, including two or more lots, or combinations of lots and portions of lots, held in single ownership and having continuous street frontage, which do not meet the zoning district standards as to lot area or lot width upon adoption of this article shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purpose of this article. No such lot or portion of such lot shall be used or sold in a manner that diminishes compliance with these standards, nor shall any division of any lot be made which creates a substandard lot as concerns lot area or lot width. 
                  A single family dwelling and permitted accessory structures may be erected on a lot of record which has been legally platted as of the date of adoption of this chapter located in any district in which single family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this chapter, provided the use is confined to a single family residence. Such a lot must be held in separate ownership and not of continuous street frontage with adjacent lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply notwithstanding the failure of such lot to comply with the applicable zoning district standards as to lot area or lot width, provided further that yard dimensions of the lot and standards other than those applying to lot area or width, or both, shall conform to the standards for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of yard requirements in such cases shall be obtained only through action of the mayor and council. 
                  (2)  Any lot that has been reduced in size as the result of land being taken for public purposes and was a legal lot of record at the time of such taking shall be construed as nonconforming.

                  Sec. 86-324. - Characteristics of use permitted by variance not to be construed as nonconforming. 
                  Except as otherwise provided herein, any characteristic of use such as a nonconforming building setback, which has been duly granted by the mayor and council, shall not be deemed nonconforming, but shall without further action be considered conforming.

                  Sec. 86-325. - Nonconforming characteristics of use. 
                  No change in accessory characteristics of use, such as off-street parking and loading, lighting, or other matters pertaining to the use of land, structures or premises shall be made which increases the degree of nonconformity with the requirements of this chapter involving a use rendered nonconforming by adoption or amendment of this chapter. Changes may be made which result in the same or a lesser degree of nonconformity. In cases where land is taken for public purposes in such a manner as to reduce off-street parking or loading space below that previously existing and required by the regulations for the zoning district, the deficiency thus created shall be construed as a nonconforming characteristic of use.

                  Sec. 86-341. - Establishment. 
                  This article establishes the process for consideration of minor deviations, that is, variances from the standards of the ordinance as well as appeals of decisions of the code enforcement officer or other official of the city in administration of this chapter.

                  The mayor and council shall have the authority to grant variances from certain provisions of this chapter and to decide appeals from a decision of the code enforcement officer or other official of the city. The city clerk shall serve as secretary to the mayor and council. The secretary shall keep minutes of council proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact. A written record of all transactions, actions, examinations, votes, abstinences and absences of council members and those who appear before the mayor and council shall be maintained by the city clerk and shall be a public record. 
                  The mayor and council shall adopt rules and regulations for the conduct of public hearings in accordance with the provisions of this article, consistent with state laws and the city code and appropriate to the responsibilities of the mayor and council, including enforcement of the provisions of this chapter. Said rules and regulations shall operate uniformly in all cases.

                  Sec. 86-343. - Powers and duties. 
                  mayor and council shall have the following powers: 
                  (1)  Hear and decide appeals from the decision of the code enforcement officer where an error in any order, interpretation, requirement, decision or determination in the enforcement of this chapter is alleged. The mayor and council may, in compliance with this chapter, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination which has been appealed and shall have the authority of code enforcement officer to implement decisions of the mayor and council. 
                  (2)  Grant variances from the standards of this chapter in instances in which strict application of such standards would result in unnecessary hardship. Such minor deviations from the standards must be in harmony with the spirit and intent of this chapter. All such variances must be based upon evidence submitted before the mayor and council and upon findings, supported by the testimony or by documentary testimony, that such variance shall be required in the following instances: 
                  a.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography that are not applicable to other lands or structures in the same district. 
                  b.  The property subject to the variance possesses one or more unique characteristics generally not applicable to similarly situated properties. 
                  c.  A literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties of the district in which the property is located. 
                  d.  The grant of the variance will not grant a special privilege to the property owner. 
                  e.  The applicant can demonstrate that without a variance there can be no reasonable use of the property. 
                  f.  The grant of the variance is not based solely on economic reasons, nor is the need for the variance the result of actions of the applicant. 
                  g.  The variance is the minimum necessary to allow reasonable use of the property. 
                  h.  The grant of the variance will not be injurious to the public health, safety or welfare. 
                  i.  The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this chapter and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or to the general welfare.

                  Sec. 86-344. - Procedures. 
                  Applications for a public hearing and decision on variances and administrative appeals shall be filed with the city clerk on forms provided by the city a minimum of 30 days prior to the hearing at which such applications will be heard. Each application shall contain such information as the city clerk may require sufficient to enable mayor and council to render a decision. No submitted application may be amended following public notice of the application; however, mayor and council may allow such application to be amended during the public hearing. 
                  An appeal to mayor and council may be brought by any person having a substantial interest in any decision of the code enforcement officer or by any officer, department, board or agency of the city affected by any decision of the code enforcement officer pursuant to enforcement of this chapter. Such appeal shall be filed within ten business days following notice of the decision being appealed by filing a written notice of appeal with the code enforcement officer and specifying the grounds, thereof. The code enforcement officer shall forthwith transmit to the secretary of the mayor and council all the documents related to the decision being appealed. 
                  A property owner shall not initiate an appeal affecting a decision of the code enforcement officer within 12 months following a determination by mayor and council. An application for a variance affecting the same property shall not be accepted by the city more than once every 12 months; however, an applicant may petition mayor and council to waive such waiting period by demonstrating that the situation or amount of variance requested which led to denial have materially changed or the request is materially different. 
                  A property owner, with the consent of mayor and council, may voluntarily withdraw such owner's appeal once prior to the time such appeal is acted upon by the mayor and council. 
                  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying any variances granted. 
                  (1)  Approved variances shall expire 12 months following the date of the hearing at which such approval was granted unless a building permit is obtained and development or construction initiated. 
                  (2)  Variances granted by mayor and council shall remain in effect only as long as the property to which such variance applies remains in the same zoning classification such property was in at the time the variance was granted. 
                  (3)  Variances may not be granted by mayor and council conditioned upon city council approval of an application to amend this chapter or the official zoning map. 
                  (4)  Every judgment of the mayor and council granting a variance or appeal shall be accompanied by a finding of fact specifying the reasons thereof. In granting any variance under the provisions of this section, the mayor and council may assign such conditions to the approval as will, in its opinion, substantially secure the purposes of this chapter. The mayor and council may designate conditions to be performed or met by the user or property owner, to protect the public health, safety, comfort, convenience, and general welfare of the community, including safeguards for the future development of Jonesboro, with respect to light, air, population density and conformance with the adopted comprehensive plan. 
                  (5)  The existence of a nonconforming use of neighboring land, buildings or structures in the same or in other districts shall not constitute a reason for approval of a variance. 
                  (6)  No variance may permit a use of land, buildings or structures not permitted by right in the district involved. 
                  A copy of the paid in full tax bill or a letter from the city certifying that all taxes have been paid must accompany an application for a variance.

                  Variances or appeals shall be considered at a public hearing for the purpose of accepting findings concerning individual applications. Such hearings shall be held only after substantial compliance with all required public notification of the hearing as set forth in this article. 
                  The mayor and council shall render a determination with respect to the appeal or application within a period of 60 days from the date said appeal or application is filed. Any party may appear at the hearing in person, or by agent or represented by an attorney-at-law. 
                  All hearings of the mayor and council shall be open to the public. 
                  The mayor and council shall conduct hearings or convene a meeting for other business at such times as established by or at the call of mayor and council.

                  The mayor and council shall fix a reasonable time for hearing an appeal or for any application for variance filed pursuant to this article. The code enforcement officer shall post in a conspicuous location on the affected property one or more signs, each of which shall be a minimum of three square feet and contain the time, date, location and purpose of the public hearing and such other information as the code enforcement officer deems appropriate. Such notice shall be provided a minimum of 15 days prior to the date of the hearing. The city clerk shall publish a legal notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the city a minimum of 15 days, but not more than 45 days prior to the public hearing stating the time, date, location and purpose of the public hearing.

                  Applications for a text amendment or map amendment filed by any person or entity other than the City of Jonesboro shall be governed by all provisions of this section. 
                  O.C.G.A. § 36-66-4, and amendments thereof, shall govern public notice procedures associated with text or map amendment proposed by the city. Specifically, the city shall provide for a pubic hearing concerning the proposed zoning decision. The public notice requirements shall be as described in subsection (1) below. 
                  Prior to enacting an amendment to this chapter, whether the proposed amendment is an amendment to the text of the zoning ordinance or an amendment to the official zoning map, the city council shall give public notice and hold a public hearing thereon. The purpose of the public hearing shall be to receive and consider public comment regarding the merits of the proposed amendment. Such hearings shall be held only following substantial compliance with all required public notification of the hearing as set forth in this section. 
                  (1)  The city shall publish a legal notice in a newspaper of general circulation in Jonesboro no fewer than 15 calendar days nor more than 45 calendar days prior to the required public hearing before council. Such notice shall state the time, date, location and purpose of the hearing as well as the nature of the proposed amendment. The procedures followed in accomplishing city initiated amendments, including text amendments and map amendments, shall comply with the public notice provisions of O.C.G.A. § 36-66-4; however, subsection (2) below shall not apply to the city. 
                  (2)  In addition to the notice requirements of subsection (1) above, proposed amendments to the official zoning map, property rezonings, shall require the city to post a public notice on the property being proposed for rezoning. The public works director shall post one or more signs, as appropriate, on such property, each of which shall be no less than six square feet in area. Such signs shall be erected in a conspicuous place on the property and shall convey the time, date and location of the public hearing as well as the current and proposed zoning applicable to the property and such other information as the city manager deems appropriate. 
                  In the case of a property proposed for rezoning having no frontage on a public street, an additional sign shall be erected on the right-of-way of the nearest public street providing access to the property. No public hearing shall be held by city council unless such signs have been posted for a minimum period of 15 calendar days. Said signs shall remain posted until a final decision by the city has been rendered. 
                  (Ord. No. 05-08, § 2(12.06), 8-15-05) 
                  Sec. 86-367. - Procedures for public hearings. 
                  Public hearings concerning zoning matters shall be accomplished in accordance with the following procedures: 
                  At the beginning of the public hearing, the mayor shall indicate that a public hearing has been called for consideration of a zoning decision or decisions. The council shall consider each application individually. 
                  The applicant or agent shall be present at the hearing before the council concerning the application. In the event an agent is present, rather than the applicant, such agent must have full authority to act on behalf of the applicant with regard to all matters pertaining to the application. Any person desiring a written record of the hearing proceedings shall so inform the city clerk a minimum of five business days prior to the date of the hearing. The city clerk shall arrange for the services of a stenographer to record the proceedings. The cost of such recording shall be borne by the person requesting such written record. 
                  No submitted application may be amended after public notice of the request has been given provided; however, council may allow such application to be amended during the public hearing. 
                  Individuals wishing to speak at the public hearing shall register their interest on a "sign up sheet" provided by the city clerk prior to the public hearing. The mayor shall announce the public hearing, explaining the purpose of the hearing and the procedures to be followed during the hearing. The mayor may then request a report from the officers or agents of the city concerning the application. The applicant for a rezoning or text amendment will then be given a maximum of 15 minutes in which to present his application. Individuals in support of the application may then speak, followed by those in opposition to the application. Each side shall be given 15 minutes in which to comment. The applicant shall then be afforded five minutes for rebuttal and final comments. Rebuttal must be limited to points raised by opponents to the application at the hearing. No person in attendance is to address the mayor and council unless first formally recognized by the mayor. Upon coming to the podium to speak, each person recognized shall state his or her full name and home address. This sequence is summarized in the table below. 

                   
                  Once these proceedings have been concluded, the mayor shall formally close the public hearing. Following the closing of the hearing, city council may either vote upon the application, or may continue the hearing to a date certain for the purpose of evaluating additional information, provided that the time, date and location for a decision on the zoning application shall be announced immediately upon the closing of the public hearing. 
                  After hearing evidence at the public hearing, city council shall apply the evidence to the standards of review and other general lines of inquiry in making their decision. The council shall not be required to consider every criterion contained in the standards of review, or every standard. The burden of proof that the proposed zoning map amendment promotes the public health, safety, morality and general welfare shall rest with the applicant. 
                  Should city council determine from the evidence presented that the applicant has demonstrated that the proposed zoning map amendment promotes the public health, safety, morals and general welfare under the standards of review and other general lines of inquiry, then the application shall be approved and the proposed zoning shall be granted, subject to such reasonable conditions as may be imposed by the council. In the event of a failure of the applicant to so demonstrate, such application shall be denied. 
                  In ruling on any application in which the applicant has brought a challenge to the existing zoning classification, the council may impose upon such property any appropriate zoning classification, including appropriate conditions which have as their purpose mitigation of potential impacts on surrounding property and on the public health, safety, morals and general welfare. The council may also approve the application, approve with appropriate conditions or impose any appropriate zoning classification for any portion of the area proposed for rezoning, thus reducing the boundaries of the area rezoned. 
                  Applications for a zoning map amendment which do not contain specific site plans carry a rebuttable presumption that such rezoning shall adversely affect the zoning scheme. The applicant shall be allowed to submit renderings, site plans and other exhibits depicting any proposed construction should a map amendment be approved; however, the applicant may be required to develop according to such plans if approved by city council. Any deviation from such approved plans shall require approval of a new rezoning application. The council may also require or attach to any rezoning such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed building, structure or use as council may deem advisable so as to improve the quality of life through the prevention of air, land, water and noise pollution and promotion of aesthetic considerations.

                  Sec. 86-368. - Zoning decisions. 
                  Only the mayor and city council shall render a final zoning decision. Action on a map or text amendment at a public hearing shall be by majority vote of the members of city council. A motion to approve or deny a map or text amendment must be passed by an affirmative vote of a majority of the members voting in order for the motion to be approved. 
                  A zoning decision affecting an individual property shall be accompanied by an ordinance describing the rezoning and adopted by mayor and council. This ordinance shall stipulate the conditions of zoning and shall adopt as an exhibit any site plans and other materials tendered by the applicant in defining the conditions of zoning and as provided in article VIII of this chapter.

                  Any applicant wishing to withdraw a rezoning application prior to final action by mayor and council shall file a written request for withdrawal with the city manager. Provided such request is received prior to publication of the notice for the public hearing, the application shall be withdrawn administratively by the city manager without restriction on the re-filing of a rezoning application concerning the property. An applicant may withdraw a zoning application at any time during a public hearing prior to a vote by mayor and council with or without prejudice, at the discretion of the council; however, the application fee will not be refunded.

                  A decision of the mayor and city council shall be final and may be appealed only to a court of competent jurisdiction. Such appeal must be taken within 30 days of the decision of the mayor and city council. Reconsideration of a rezoning action under court order shall follow the same procedures of this section as though a new application were being filed.

                  Any application that proposes a change in the stipulations previously established as conditions of approval by the mayor and city council through action on a rezoning shall be weighed against the standards set forth in section 86-374 for a property rezoning and shall follow the procedures for consideration of a rezoning application by mayor and council.

                  A property rezoning shall be in full force and effect upon approval of the zoning application at an advertised public hearing and adoption of an accompanying ordinance by mayor and council. 
                  Property on which a use, building, structure or other improvements conformed with this chapter prior to the effective date of a rezoning affecting the property, and was thereby rendered nonconforming, shall be governed by the provisions of article X of this chapter. Similarly, construction of any building, structure or other improvements for which a building permit has been issued in conformity with this chapter prior to the effective date of a rezoning affecting the property may continue to completion in accordance with provisions of section 86-6. Development projects under construction and, upon completion, shall be governed by the provisions of this chapter.

                  An application for a map amendment affecting the same property shall not be submitted more than once every 12 months provided; however, that mayor and council may approve a reduction in the waiting period to no less than six months in extenuating circumstances. The waiting period shall be measured from the date of action by mayor and council either approving or denying such a rezoning application. This provision shall not apply to properties affected by an amendment filed by the council, nor shall zoning classifications adopted pursuant to an annexation of property into the city be considered zoning amendments under this section.

                  (a)  In ruling on any application for a zoning map amendment, city council shall act in the best interest of the public health, safety, morals and general welfare. In so doing, the council shall consider one or more of the following factors as may be relevant to the application; such consideration may be based on reports prepared by the city or its agents: 
                  (1)  Relationship to the established land use pattern. The city shall assess the use and development of surrounding properties that tend to define the context of the property proposed for rezoning and determine whether the proposal is consistent with this context. 
                  (2)  Compatibility with comprehensive plan; timing of development. The city shall determine whether the proposal is compatible with the city of Jonesboro Comprehensive Plan, including land uses indicated on the future land use map. The city shall also assess, based on the adopted comprehensive plan, whether the proposal would encourage use or development that is compatible with the timing of development anticipated in such policy guides as the community facilities and services element and the short term work program. 
                  (3)  Suitability of the zoning proposal. The city shall determine whether the proposed zoning will permit a use of the property that is suitable in view of the zoning and use of adjacent and nearby property. 
                  (4)  Impact on public facilities and services; referrals to other agencies. The city shall consider the availability of public facilities and services such as schools, water or sewer utilities, and police or fire protection, including those provided by other public agencies or authorities, and the impact of the proposal on demand for those public facilities and services. 
                  (5)  Impact on public financial resources. The city shall assess the budgetary impact of the zoning proposal on the city and other public agencies or authorities in delivery, enhancement, expansion or maintenance of public utilities, schools, streets and other public services. 
                  (6)  Availability of other land suitable for the proposed use; effect on balance of land uses. The city shall consider the availability of other appropriate land already zoned for the proposed use, generally, and the availability of such land near the property proposed for rezoning. 
                  (7)  Impact on neighborhood character. The city shall consider whether the proposal is consistent with the architectural style, density, scale and dwelling type prevalent in the surrounding neighborhood. The city shall also assess potential impacts of uses that would be permitted under the proposed zoning on the neighborhood, particularly any substantial adverse impacts on neighborhood quality or stability, or of any tendency of those uses to cause blight or depreciation. 
                  (8)  Opportunity for economic use of property. The city shall consider whether the property has a reasonable economic use as currently zoned and determine whether substantial factors are present that prevent economic use of the property in accordance with existing regulations. 
                  (9)  Effect on adjacent property. The city shall consider whether the zoning proposal will adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property. 
                  (10)  Impact on surrounding property values. The city shall determine whether the zoning proposal will be a deterrent to the value or improvement of adjacent property in accordance with existing regulations. 
                  (11)  Circumstances peculiar to the context. The city shall assess conditions or trends affecting the use and development of the property which may not be anticipated by the comprehensive plan or accounted for in the existing zoning of the property and determine whether such factors as may be present support approval or denial of the zoning proposal. 
                  (12)  Impact on the public interest. The city shall judge whether the proposal reflects a reasonable balance between the promotion of the public health, safety, morality or general welfare and the right of individuals to unrestricted use of property. 
                  (13)  Environmental impact. The city shall consider the possible impacts of the proposal on the environment, including, but not limited to, storm drainage, soil erosion and sedimentation, flooding, air quality, loss of natural areas and habitat and water quality and quantity. 
                  (b)  The city council shall also consider the following general lines of inquiry in assessing the appropriateness of a rezoning proposal: 
                  (1)  Existing uses and zoning of the subject and nearby property; 
                  (2)  Extent to which property values are diminished by the particular zoning restrictions; 
                  (3)  Extent to which the destruction of property values, if any, promotes the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the public; 
                  (4)  Relative gain to the public, as compared to the hardship, if any, imposed on the individual property owner; 
                  (5)  Suitability of subject property for zoned purposes; and 
                  (6)  Length of time the property, if vacant, has been vacant as zoned, considered in the context of land development in the areas and the vicinity of the property.

                  The text of this chapter may be amended from time to time in whole or in part by mayor and council under the provisions of section 86-366. Such an amendment may be proposed when public necessity, general welfare or sound zoning practice justify such action by mayor and council. In ruling on any application for a text amendment, city council shall act in the best interest of the public health, safety, morals and general welfare. In so doing, the council shall consider one or more of the following factors as may be relevant to the application; such consideration may be based on reports prepared by the city or its agents: 
                  (1)  Relationship to the purposes of the ordinance. The city shall determine whether the proposed amendment is consistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter as stated in article I. 
                  (2)  Relationship to the comprehensive plan. The city shall determine whether the proposal is compatible with the City of Jonesboro Comprehensive Plan. 
                  (3)  Impact of trends and changing conditions. The city shall assess the necessity of the proposed amendment in addressing new trends or changing conditions essential to implementation of the comprehensive plan. 
                  (4)  Impact on the public interest. The city shall determine whether the proposed amendment reasonably promotes the public health, safety, morality and general welfare.

                  Approval of a text amendment shall be in full force and effect upon its approval by the mayor and city council or upon the stated effective date thereof. Use of property impacted by adoption of such amendments shall be subject to all provisions of section 86-372.

                  The purpose of this article is to provide for accommodation of passenger vehicles, light trucks and delivery vehicles in the conduct of permitted uses established on private property. Such accommodation pertains to adequate physical space for the storage of individual vehicles, including vehicles used by motorists with a disability, and spaces adequate in number and location to serve individual uses. This article also provides for adequate access to parking and storage facilities as well as circulation within the property. As the parking and storage of vehicles can have adverse impacts on surrounding properties and the traveling public associated with glare, vibration, dust, noise and visual impacts, this article is established to mitigate such impacts through introduction of setbacks, buffering and landscape standards.

                  Sec. 86-393. - Continuing obligation to provide off-street parking and loading. 
                  No existing off-street parking or loading space, or part thereof, and no part of an off-street parking or loading space hereafter provided which meets all or part of the requirement for off-street parking or loading set forth in this article, shall be reduced or eliminated unless no longer required by this article or unless alternate parking or loading space fulfilling this article is otherwise provided. 
                  Except as specifically hereinafter provided, no part of a parking or loading space required for any one building or use shall be included as part of the off-street parking or loading space of another building or use in meeting the requirements of this article. No building shall hereafter be erected or altered which reduces off-street parking or loading space below minimums set forth in this article, or which provides more parking or loading space where parking limitations apply. 
                  This article also prohibits the use of any property unless vehicle parking and loading space in conformance to this article is provided.

                  Sec. 86-395. - Location of off-street parking. 
                  Off-street parking for single family and two family dwellings shall not be located between the principal dwelling and the public right-of-way, except on a hard surface driveway using asphalt or concrete pavement, or other hard surface as may be approved by the city manager, or in an enclosed garage. 
                  Off-street parking or vehicle storage in an R-A or RM zoning district shall be located in either the rear or side yard. No more than 25 percent of the parking required in the OandI district may be located between the building and a public right-of-way. No off-street parking shall be located within 20 feet of any residentially zoned property, nor within 20 feet of the street right-of-way as measured along a driveway. A landscaped buffer having a minimum width of 20 feet shall be established and maintained when parking surfaces abut any residentially zoned property. (See article XV, Landscaping and buffers.) 
                  Off-street parking in an R-A, RM, O-I, MX, HD-1, HD-2, C-1, C-2 or M-1 district shall be set back from the front property line a minimum distance of ten feet, and this setback shall be maintained as a buffer. 
                  Unless otherwise provided in this article, off-street parking and loading spaces as well as all drives and maneuvering areas shall be located a minimum of five feet from all property lines, and such areas shall be maintained as a landscaped buffer. Where those spaces and areas abut off-street parking and loading spaces or drives and maneuvering areas on adjacent property, no such setback shall be required. 
                  (Ord. No. 05-08, § 2(13.05), 8-15-05) 
                  Sec. 86-396. - Off-street vehicle parking may be provided off premises. 
                  Off-street vehicle parking or storage space shall be provided on every lot sufficient to accommodate the use thereon or hereafter established. However, in instances in which on-site parking is impractical, the city manager may approve parking provided within 500 feet of the property on which such uses are established upon a finding that such parking may be safely and conveniently accessed by pedestrians. Relief from the off-street vehicle parking requirements of this Article shall not be granted for parking for the disabled. Such off-premises shall be associated with the permitted use, and shall not be hereafter be reduced or encroached upon in any manner. Such off-premises parking may be located within 1,000 feet for uses in the HD-1 or HD-2 district. 
                  Off-premises parking used to comply with this section must be located on property having the same or less restrictive zoning as the property the off-premise parking serves. In addition, an easement or other recordable instrument satisfactory to the city attorney dedicating the off-premises parking to the property the spaces serve shall be recorded with the clerk of the superior court and a copy provided to the city manager. The document must survive changes in ownership in perpetuity, unless dissolved with approval of mayor and council. 
                  The maximum distances of this section shall be measured from the property on which the use is established along the public right-of-way or public sidewalk to the property supplying such off-premises parking.

                  The provisions of this section shall apply to all off-street parking whether the parking serves a particular use or development, or the parking is a principal use on a property and not dedicated to serving a particular development. 
                  (1)  Curbs required. Concrete curbs shall be provided for all paved areas, and shall be used to separate landscaped areas from pavement. 
                  (2)  Striping required. Every parking space shall be clearly marked by lines painted on or otherwise applied to the parking lot surface. 
                  (3)  Paved surface. No vehicle parking of any kind shall be permitted on any lot unless all driveways and parking spaces are comprised of an impervious surface consisting of concrete, asphalt, brick or decorative stone pavers. No gravel shall be used except as subgrade material. 
                  Except for parcels devoted to single-family detached dwellings, all off-street parking shall be designed to accommodate a turn around area so that motorists are not required to back into a public street to exit the property.

                  Sec. 86-399. - Maximum driveway width. 
                  The maximum width for driveways serving properties occupied or intended to be occupied by a single family detached dwelling shall not exceed nine feet as measured at the right-of-way line. The maximum width for any other property shall not exceed 35 feet as measured at the right-of-way line. For the purpose of this section, driveway width shall be measured to the curb face. 
                  Access aisles in parking lots serving spaces perpendicular to the access aisle shall have a minimum width of 24 feet, and provide for two-way traffic. Access aisles serving angled parking spaces shall be one-way and shall have a minimum width of 18 feet for 60 degree angle parking and 13 feet for 45 degree angle parking to the aisle. Angle parking of less than 45 degree to the access aisle is prohibited, except for parallel parking. Interior drives on commercial property shall not exceed 30 feet. 
                  Driveway separations. The minimum distance between a private driveway serving one single-family dwelling and a street intersection shall be 20 feet; this minimum distance shall be 50 feet for all other uses. Minimum distance between private driveways serving single-family dwellings along a street right-of-way shall be ten feet; this minimum distance shall be 40 feet for all other uses. 
                  The minimum distance between a private driveway serving one single family dwelling and a property line shall be five feet; this minimum distance shall be 20 feet for all other residential uses and 50 feet for all other uses.

                  Sec. 86-401. - Location of driveways.

                  Sec. 86-402. - Inter-parcel access required. 
                  The owner of property on which any office, retail sales or services use is established shall grant an access easement as described in this section to each adjoining property that is zoned or used for office, retail sales or services uses. The purpose of the easement is to facilitate movement of motorists from business to business without generating additional turning movements on the public street, thus increasing public safety and convenience. 
                  The easement shall permit vehicle access from the adjoining property to driveways and parking areas intended for customer or tenant use; however, parking spaces may be restricted to use by the property owner's customers and tenants, only. 
                  The granting of such easement shall be effective only upon the granting of a reciprocal easement by the adjoining property owner. Upon the availability of access to driveways and parking areas of the adjoining property, the pavement or other surfacing of each driveway and parking area shall be extended by each owner to the point of access on the property line. 
                  Where the proposed land use is such that any adverse impact of the easement on the use of the property would outweigh the reduced impact on the public street realized by the easement, mayor and city council may waive the requirement for inter-parcel access easements, in whole or in part.

                  Lighting used to illuminate parking areas shall be designed and located to direct light away from residential uses and to prevent glare on any abutting property or create a hazard for motorists. Parking areas shall not be illuminated between the hours of 12:00 midnight and 6:00 a.m.; unless the uses on the property are open for business, although temporary activation by motion detectors may be allowed to provide security lighting for periods not to exceed 15 minutes. 
                  All commercial, institutional or industrial properties shall achieve a minimum lighting standard of 2.0 foot-candles measured at grade across the entire parking facility.

                  Sec. 86-405. - Joint use of required off-street parking spaces. 
                  No portion of an off-street parking facility required for any building or use for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this section shall be considered as part of an off-street parking facility similarly required for another building or use. In instances in which the hours of operation of uses for which a sharing, or joint use, of parking facilities is proposed indicate that the respective parking demands occur at alternating times of the day, city council may grant approval for such joint use of parking facilities. Granting of such approvals shall be based on a finding by the council that the proposed joint use of parking will not generate excessive demand for on-street parking or otherwise adversely impact traffic movement or public safety.

                  ARTICLE XVI. - SIGNS 

                  Sec. 86-475. - Short title. 
                  This article shall hereafter be known and cited as the "Sign Ordinance of the City of Jonesboro." 
                  ( Ord. No. 2016-004, § 1(Exh. A), 3-14-16 ) 
                  Sec. 86-476. - Findings and purpose. 
                  (a)  Findings. The governing authority of the City of Jonesboro hereby finds as follows: 
                  (1)  The explosive growth experienced in the entire Atlanta metropolitan area over the past two decades has impacted the city. Significant infrastructure improvements in the area have included the expansion of Tara Boulevard and other major thoroughfares within the municipal limits of the city. As a result of these improvements, the city has witnessed a dramatic increase in traffic and the addition of numerous signs within its limits. Uniform regulation of signage providing information to the motoring public is essential to minimize hazards to pedestrians and vehicle operators. 
                  (2)  Exterior signs have a substantial impact on the character and the quality of a community. This is particularly true in the city as very few areas within its limits are distinctly residential or distinctly commercial and homes are often found in close proximity to commercial areas. Moreover, the unique character of the historical areas of the city is especially vulnerable to the impact of exterior signs. A plethora of unregulated signs will have a negative impact on the visual characteristics of the community. Regulation of signs will protect property values and the aesthetic character of the city, maintaining it as a desirable place in which to live and to work. 
                  (3)  A variety of businesses are located within the municipal limits of the city. Their need to advertise products and services must be balanced by the city's obligation to restrict clutter, maintain an aesthetically pleasing environment, protect property values, minimize risks to pedestrians and motor vehicle operators, and enhance public safety. 
                  (4)  Signs provide an important medium through which individuals, organizations, institutions, and businesses may exercise their right to freedom of speech and expression and convey a variety of messages. 
                  (5)  The provisions in this article which regulate signs on the basis of size, height, shape, design, spacing, placement, and distance, but not on the content of any message conveyed therein, provide an appropriate balance between the right to freedom of speech and expression via the sign medium and the protection of the substantial governmental purposes stated above. 
                  (b)  Purpose. The purpose and intent of the governing authority of the city in enacting this article are as follows: 
                  (1)  To protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Jonesboro, and to implement the policies and objectives of the Comprehensive Development Plan of the City of Jonesboro through the enactment of a comprehensive set of regulations governing signs within the municipal limits of the city. 
                  (2)  To regulate the erection and placement of signs within the City of Jonesboro in order to provide safe operating conditions for pedestrian and vehicular traffic without unnecessary and unsafe distractions to drivers and pedestrians. 
                  (3)  To preserve the value on property on which signs are located and from which signs may be viewed. 
                  (4)  To maintain an aesthetically attractive city in which signs are compatible with the use patterns of existing zoning districts. 
                  (5)  To establish comprehensive sign regulations which effectively balance legitimate business and development needs with a safe and aesthetically attractive environment for residents, workers, and visitors to the city. 
                  (6)  To provide fair and reasonable opportunities for the identification of businesses which are located within the city, and to provide for the identification of the availability of products, goods or services which are available upon site so as to promote the economic vitality of businesses which are located within the city. 
                  (7)  To ensure the protection of the right to freedom of speech and expression provided under the Constitutions of the United States and the State of Georgia and, in no event, place restrictions that apply to any given sign dependent on the communicative content of the sign. 
                  (8)  To establish a permit system to allow specific types of signs in zoning districts consistent with the uses, intent and aesthetic characteristics of those districts. 
                  (9)  To allow certain signs that are small, safe, unobtrusive, and incidental, subject to the substantive requirements of the article but without a requirement for permits. 
                  (10)  To provide for temporary signs in limited circumstances, without regard to the communicative content of the sign. 
                  (11)  To place reasonable controls on nonconforming signs that are by definition contrary to the public health, safety, and welfare while protecting the constitutional rights of the owners of said nonconforming signs. 
                  (12)  To continue to encourage the display of public art as a vital part of the urban landscape, while imposing reasonable restrictions on such art in order to protect public safety and to avoid the abuse of a public art exemption as a means for evading the purpose and effect of these sign regulations.

                  Fees for an authorization to erect a sign and for a permit shall be fixed from time to time by the mayor and council.

                  Sec. 86-483. - Time for consideration and notification. 
                  The administrator shall process an application for authorization to erect a sign within 45 days of the city's actual receipt of a completed application and all necessary fees as required under section 86-482. The administrator shall give notice to the applicant of the decision of the city by hand delivery, by mailing to the address on the application, or by fax to the designated telephone number provided on the application on or before the 45th day after the city's receipt of the completed application and fee. Notice shall be deemed to have been given upon the date of mailing (if mailed), date of faxing (if faxed), or date of hand delivery (if hand delivered). If the administrator fails to act within the 45-day period, applicant shall notify the administrator in writing of the failure and the administrator shall issue or deny the authorization sought by the application within ten business days after the notification. If the administrator fails to act upon the application within this ten-business-day period, the authorization to erect the sign shall automatically be granted; however, the applicant must follow the final permit procedures set forth in section 86-484. 
                  ( Ord. No. 2016-004, § 1(Exh. A), 3-14-16 ) 
                  Sec. 86-484. - Decision on application and issuance of permit; violations. 
                  (a)  Denial. In the event the administrator determines that the applicant has not properly completed the application for authorization to erect the proposed sign or that the application contains any false material statement, he shall promptly notify the applicant of such fact and shall automatically deny the application. In the event the administrator determines that all requirements for approval of the application have not been met, he shall deny the application. 
                  (b)  Issuance of an authorization. Upon the filing of an application for authorization to erect a sign that contains all information required under section 86-481 and the payment of all necessary fees as required under section 86-482, the administrator shall examine all plans and specifications submitted and the premises upon which the proposed sign is to be erected. If it shall appear to the administrator that the proposed sign is in compliance with all requirements of this article and all other ordinances and laws of the city, and if a business, that the business has registered and paid any tax due pursuant to the city's occupation tax chapter, the administrator shall then issue an authorization to erect the sign pursuant to the application and any conditions placed upon the authorization by the city. If the work authorized thereby has not been completed within 180 days after the date of issuance and a final permit has not been requested in writing, the authorization shall become null and void and no final permit may be issued. 
                  (c)  Request for final permit. Within ten days after completion of the erection of a sign pursuant to an approved application, and within 180 days of the issuance of an authorization to erect a sign, the applicant shall deliver to the administrator a written request for a final permit along with current and dated color photographs of each face of the sign (at least three-inch by five-inch in size) and a signed affidavit that the photographs are current and accurate photographs of the sign faces as of the date on the photographs, that the sign was and is erected as described in the application as conditioned and authorized by the city, including the size, location; building materials, height and lighting. Within ten business days of the filing of a request for a final permit, the administrator shall issue the final permit or deny the final permit because of the applicant's failure to properly and timely submit the written permit request, failure to properly and timely document the request, or failure to properly and timely erect the sign as described in the application conditioned and authorized by the city. Notification of a denial shall be effectuated pursuant to section 86-483. Failure of the administrator to approve or deny the application for a final sign permit within said ten business days of the applicant properly and timely filing with the city a fully and properly documented written permit request shall constitute an approval of the final permit. 
                  (d)  Violations and noncompliance. An applicant who fails to complete the erection of a sign within 180 days of the issuance of an authorization or who fails to request a final permit within ten days of erection of a sign pursuant to an authorization or who fails to apply for a final permit within 180 days of the issuance of an authorization or whose request for a final permit is denied, shall remove the sign or parts of the sign within 30 days of notice from the administrator to remove the sign or parts of the sign. Failure to so remove the sign shall constitute a separate ordinance violation for each day that the sign or part of the sign is not removed from the proposed site and upon conviction, the applicant and/or owner or tenant of the sign site shall be guilty of an ordinance violation and shall be subject to fines or imprisonment as authorized by the City's Charter and Code. Furthermore, if the sign and all parts thereof are not removed within said 30 days, the city may remove the sign and all parts thereof and charge the applicant and/or owner of the site the cost of removal and disposal.

                  (a)  An applicant who is dissatisfied by a decision of the administrator rendered under section 86-484 or 86-493 may appeal such decision to the mayor and council. Any such appeal shall comply with the procedures set forth in article XI of the 2005 Zoning Ordinance, subject to the following: 
                  (1)  The notice of appeal shall be in writing and shall be filed with the administrator on or before the tenth day following the date notice of the decision of the administrator is given. In the event that no appeal is filed within this ten-day period, the decision of the administrator shall become final. In the event that an appeal is filed, the administrator shall transmit to the mayor and council all documents constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. 
                  (2)  The mayor and council shall schedule the matter for hearing within 45 days of the appeal being filed and, at such meeting, may continue the matter for ten days for further investigation to determine whether to affirm, reverse, or modify the decision of the administrator. The mayor and council shall make its final determination on the appeal on or before ten days of the close of the hearing. 
                  (3)  The review of the decision by the mayor and council shall be limited to a determination of whether or not the decision of the administrator was clearly erroneous. 
                  (b)  Any appeal of the decision of the mayor and council shall be taken to the Superior Court of Clayton County by a petition for a writ of certiorari.

                  Sec. 86-486. - Variances. 
                  (a)  The mayor and council can authorize upon appeal in a specific case such variance from the terms of this article as will not be contrary to the public interest when, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this article will, in an individual case result in extreme and unusual hardship, so the spirit of this article shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. The mere existence of a nonconforming sign shall not constitute a valid reason to grant a variance. A variance shall be granted in an individual case of extreme and unusual hardship not self-imposed only upon a finding by the mayor and council that the following conditions exist: 
                  (1)  There exist extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the property in question resulting from its size, shape, or topography which are not applicable to other lands or structures in the area; 
                  (2)  A literal interpretation of the provisions of this article would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other similar properties in the city; 
                  (3)  Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the property of the applicant significant privileges which are denied to other similar properties in the city; 
                  (4)  The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this article and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or to the general welfare; 
                  (5)  The variance is not a request to permit a type of sign which otherwise is not permitted in the zoning districts involved; 
                  (6)  The cause for the need for the variance is not created by the applicant, the owner, lessor, or successor in ownership or occupancy; 
                  (7)  Signs may be displaced upon the vertical surface of a canopy only by a variance, upon the applicant reducing the number or square footage of ground signs or wall signs authorized by this article for the lot in question, so as to reasonably set-off for the additional signs. 
                  (b)  All requests for such variances shall be in written form and filed for review by the mayor and council at its next regular meeting at least ten days prior to said meeting. 
                  (c)  No change may be made in the location, shape, color, height, size, copy or text of any sign subject to a variance unless the sign is brought into compliance with the provisions of this article and a sign permit is granted. 
                  (d)  A change in the owner, lessor, lessee, or user of property served by a sign subject to a variance shall negate the variance, and the sign shall be removed or brought into compliance with the provisions of this article and a new sign permit granted. 
                  (e)  A sign subject to a variance may not be reconstructed, replaced or reset if it is removed for any reason. 
                  (f)  When a sign under a variance has been razed or damaged by any cause, naturally occurring or otherwise, the sign shall not be re-established: 
                  (1)  If the value of the sign as damaged is 50 percent or less of the value of the sign prior to the damage; 
                  (2)  If the estimated cost of repairing the above ground portion of the sign is more than the value of the sign in its damaged condition; or 
                  (3)  Value shall be established by the administrator and shall be based upon the value of the sign's materials above ground with no allowance for the intrinsic value of the sign or the value of the right to have a sign at that location.

                  (12)  Signs which emit or utilize in any manner any sound capable of being detected on any public right-of-way by an individual with normal hearing;

                  Sec. 86-495. - Historic district. 
                  The purpose of this section is to ensure that signage in the historic district is harmonious in proportion, form, color, and materials to the character of said district. Visual relatedness is crucial to the goal of an integrated historic district, and signs play a key role in helping to preserve the historical district's sense of time and place, and to achieve the desired effect of charm and compatibility. No sign shall be erected, altered, restored or moved within the historic district until an application for a certificate of appropriateness as to exterior architectural features and signage has been reviewed and approved by the historic preservation commission. All proposed changes requiring a certificate of appropriateness shall comply with the applicable design standards in the 2005 Zoning Ordinance. 
                  (1)  Applicability. This section shall apply only to those building structures and uses within the geographical boundaries of the historic district. 
                  (2)  Compatibility. As to signs, buildings, structures, and uses within the Historic District, when a provision of this section conflicts with any section in the balance of this article, the provision of this section shall control. Otherwise, to the extent reasonably possible, the provisions of this section shall be interpreted consistent with the provisions of the balance of this article. 
                  (3)  Signage standards. 
                  a.  General. Signage shall complement the architectural details of the building, and shall not violate or otherwise obscure the architecture of the building to which it is attached. Signs, lettering, or boxed graphics shall not cut across columns, cornices, windowsills, arches or balconies, nor extend above the roofline of any building to which it is attached. 
                  b.  Lettering, size, and content. Letters can be painted or mounted directly on a signboard, storefront, wall or window, if in proportion to the storefront. Lots in the H-1 Historic District are allowed the same amount of signage as lots outside of the H-1 Historic District. In the H-1 Historic District, canopy signs and hanging or suspended signs may be utilized. Provided, however, in no case may the total signage area exceed ten percent of the building face to which the sign is attached. Acceptable lettering materials include wood, stone, synthetic stone, metal, vinyl, dimensional plastic, acrylic, or high-density polystyrene foam. The overall design of all signage shall be compatible with the turn-of-the-century theme of the historic district. 
                  c.  Materials. Signs may be constructed of concrete, brick, wood, stone, metal, glass, or synthetic materials that have the same appearance of the aforementioned natural materials due to their finish. All materials shall be compatible with the building's architecture, and should be colorfast and resistant to corrosion. Signs shall be professionally finished in accordance with the material selected, whether by sanding, painting, staining and/or sealing, with the edges of the sign framed out and/or sealed. 
                  d.  Lighting. All signs in the historic district, whether ground signs or wall signs, shall only be illuminated by an external light source, and through craftsmanship and materials, shall reflect the design aesthetics of the historic district. 
                  e.  Colors. The historic preservation commission shall approve the color or colors of all signs as well as the color or colors of all lettering, symbols, marks, pictures, figures, embellishments, frames or the like contained therein. 
                  f.  Awning and canopy signs. Awnings or canopies over doors, entrances, windows or outside service areas are permitted in the H-1 Historic District. Professionally applied forms, graphics, symbols, lettering, or other visual presentation may be incorporated into the awning or canopy valance/drop flap, but are restricted to 20 percent of the awning field. Size of the signage shall be computed as for a wall sign. Signage pursuant to this subsection shall be included within the overall amount of signage allowed under section 86-489. Awnings or canopies shall clear sidewalks by seven feet in height, and project no more than six feet from the building. Canvas or synthetic look-alike canvas, is the only material permitted for awnings and canopies. Metal or vinyl may be approved for awnings or canopies if the overall design is consistent with the H-1 Historic District's turn-of-the-century theme. Awnings or canopies may not be backlit. 
                  g.  Hanging or suspended signs. Hanging, suspended, or projecting signs are permitted and shall clear sidewalks by seven feet in height, and project no more than 36 inches from the building. Hanging or suspended signs should project from the wall at a 90-degree angle. Hanging or suspending signs over driveways, alleys, or parking areas is prohibited. Hanging, suspended, or projecting signs shall be limited to a maximum size of six square feet, and if double sided, shall be calculated as only one sign. One hanging, suspended, or projecting sign per building street frontage is permitted, and shall be calculated as part of the total signage area allowed under section 86-489. Attractive hardware for hanging is encouraged. 
                  h.  Window signs. Interior window signs shall not exceed 25 percent of the total window area exposed to public view. Window signs shall not be included within the overall amount of signage allowed under section 86-489. 
                  i.  Special events. Additional signage is permitted in the historic district under section 86-494, provided that all such additional signage conforms to the aesthetic standards of the historic district. 
                  j.  Ground signs. Ground signs may hang or suspend from a horizontal support that is affixed to the ground by vertical post. 
                  (4)  Any lot in the H-2 Historic District that is used as residential property shall comply with the residential provisions of this article. Any lot in the H-1 Historic District or the H-2 Historic District for which a business license is maintained shall comply with the non-residential provisions of this article and obtain approval of the historic preservation commission before the display of any sign.

                  APPENDIX. - THOROUGHFARE PLAN 
                  Organization of the Plan 
                  Background. This Section describes the philosophical foundations of the Thoroughfare Plan. 
                  Commonly-accepted Standards. This Section presents information, standards and design criteria commonly used by other jurisdictions. 
                  Design Guidelines for Street Classifications. This Section provides standards and design criteria used by the North Carolina Department of Transportation. 
                  Jonesboro Thoroughfare Plan. This Section represents the application of those standards and design criteria to the Jonesboro context, and comprises the proposed Thoroughfare Plan standards and criteria. 
                  Background 
                  The approach characterizing the Jonesboro Thoroughfare Plan stems from "New Urbanism" and "Traditional Neighborhood Development" models. The approach is also to "Keep It Simple," and accordingly, the name of the plan is proposed as the Jonesboro Thoroughfare Plan. 
                  Post-war Development Model 
                  The following excerpt conveys the roots of these development models that spell a return to a traditional development model that preceded widespread automobile ownership and suburbanization of America. 
                  "Prior to WWII, the traditional neighborhood street was in the range of 28 feet—30 feet wide with corner radius of 5 feet—10 feet. Since that time, the typical local street has grown to a width of 36 feet, with a corner radius of 25 feet. The wider street was intended to move traffic more quickly and efficiently. It has. Unfortunately, faster traffic and increased amounts of asphalt have diminished the quality of our neighborhoods. 
                  Through the first quarter of this century, the United States was developed in the form of compact, mixed-use neighborhoods. The pattern began to change with the emergence of modern architecture and zoning and ascension of the automobile. After World War II, a new system of development was implemented nationwide, replacing neighborhoods with a rigorous separation of uses that has become known as conventional suburban development, or sprawl. The majority of US citizens now live in suburban communities built in the last 50 years." 
                  Principles of New Urbanism The strength of New Urbanism lies in the design of neighborhoods. This is guided by principles developed by town planners Andres Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk. According to these planners, an authentic neighborhood contains most of the following elements: 
                  A.  The neighborhood has a discernible center. This is often a square of a green, and sometimes a busy or memorable street corner. A transit stop would be located at this center. 
                  B.  Most of the dwellings are within a five-minute walk of the center, an average of roughly 2,000 feet. 
                  C.  There is a variety of dwelling types — usually detached dwellings, townhouses and apartments — so that younger and older people, singles and families, the poor and the wealthy may find places to live. 
                  D.  There are shops and offices at the edge of the neighborhood, of sufficiently varied types to supply the weekly needs of a household. 
                  E.  A small ancillary building is permitted within the backyard of each house. It may be used as a rental unit or place to work, e.g., office or craft workshop. 
                  F.  An elementary school is near enough so that most children may walk from their home. 
                  G.  There are small playgrounds near every dwelling — not more than a tenth of a mile away. 
                  H.  Streets within the neighborhood are a connected network that disperses traffic by providing a variety of pedestrian and vehicular routes to any destination. 
                  I.  The streets are relatively narrow and shaded by rows of trees. This slows traffic, creating an environment suitable for pedestrians and bicycles. 
                  J.  Buildings in the neighborhood center are placed close to the street, creating a well-defined outdoor space. 
                  K.  Parking lots and garage doors rarely front the street. Parking is relegated to the rear of buildings, usually accessed by alleys. 
                  L.  Certain prominent sites at the termination of street vistas or in the neighborhood center are reserved for civic buildings. These provide sites for community meetings, education, religion or cultural activities. 
                  Commonly-Accepted Standards 
                  A number of state highway departments have developed standards that advance TND objectives. These standards are consistent with Jonesboro's historic development pattern and are presented here for application to the proposed Jonesboro Thoroughfare Plan. 
                  Street Construction Design Guidelines 
                  Design Speed 
                  Maximum design speeds should consider the street type, vehicle use and the proposed speed limit. As most streets are "lanes" and "streets" which provide direct access to neighborhoods, the maximum desired vehicle speed is approximately 20 mph. 
                  Street Types and Widths 
                  Specific dimensions of each street element are provided in the table below; dimensions are from curb face to curb face. 
                  STREET TYPES AND PROPOSED WIDTHS 

                   
                  NOTE: Bicycle lanes are optional when alternate routes to the same destination are provided. 
                  Many of the standards advocated in this reference are designed to accommodate the "most frequent and numerous users of TND street networks," that is, motorists, cyclists and pedestrians. Use by oversized vehicles, such as delivery trucks, moving vans, school buses and fire trucks, is generally infrequent, particularly on residential streets and lanes. A basic premise of TND-responsive design is that "A street should be no wider than the minimum width needed to accommodate the usual vehicular mix desired for that street. On a properly designed TND street, the occasional oversized vehicle may cross the centerline of a street when making a right turn." 
                  Stopping Sight Distances 
                  Minimum stopping distances are referenced to design speed. According to the TND standards advanced, sight distances should be accommodated for both vertical and horizontal alignments. Stopping distances must be increased for downhill grades. Distances under wet pavement conditions are as follows: 

                   
                  Vertical Curve Design 
                  K values for vertical curve design should be consistent with design speeds. The maximum centerline grades should also be consistent with design standards. 
                  Centerline Radii 
                  The criteria for minimum centerline radius for design speeds of 25 mph or less (no super elevation) are: 

                   
                  Curb Radii 
                  A minimum curb radius of 15 feet is recommended for design speeds of 20 mph. Certain intersections on avenues, main streets and boulevards may require a curb radius of as much as 25 feet. In instances of larger curb radii, sidewalks may be set back six to 10 feet from curbs. In addition, on-street parking may be prohibited within 30 feet of the intersection on each street. 
                  Intersection Sight Triangles 
                  The minimum sight triangle for stop conditions at street intersections shall be 70 feet along the major road right-of-way and 20 feet along the minor road right-of-way. The intersection sight triangle shall be permanent right-of-way. These dimensions may be reduced for lower design speeds on lanes and streets. 
                  Curb Construction 
                  All curbed streets shall be built in accordance with GDOT requirements for vertical curb and gutter construction. Gutters for lanes are to be two feet wide; street median gutters are to be one foot. 
                  Pavement Design 
                  Alleys shall conform to City of Jonesboro standards as to pavement section for local streets. All other roads shall meet the pavement design criteria established in the "City of Jonesboro Development Code." 
                  Sidewalks 
                  Minimum sidewalk width is five feet for neighborhoods and eight feet for commercial districts. Sidewalks shall also meet or exceed the guidelines of the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
                  Cyclists 
                  On lower volume streets, cyclists should be considered a normal part of the vehicle traffic on the street. On higher volume streets, cyclists should be accommodated with six-foot wide bike lanes; separate bikeways may be considered. Routing for cyclists may include signs and striping, including changing the color of the bike lane, as appropriate. 
                  Transit 
                  Road design should be compatible with transit. Transit should be addressed wherever it is present and should be appropriately planned for developing areas. 
                  On-street Parking 
                  Parking on lanes and local streets is not designated or marked. On-street parking along major streets should be signed, marked or otherwise clearly designated. 
                  Curb Cuts 
                  Curb cuts, or driveways, should be minimized to reduce impacts to on-street parking, conflicts with pedestrians and cyclists and interruptions in traffic flow. 
                  Planting Strips and Street Trees 
                  Planting strips, located between the curb and sidewalk, parallel with the street, shall be six feet or more in width. Small street trees may be planted within three feet of the back of curb and should generally be planted along the centerline of the planting strip along streets with design speeds of 20 mph or less, or along streets with on-street parking. In commercial areas with high pedestrian volumes, granted tree wells may be used in lieu of planting strips. Trees and other objects should be restricted from corners for distances of 30 feet on all sides to maintain sight lines. Along all planting strips, the area between two feet and seven feet above ground shall be maintained as a clear zone to preserve sight lines and accommodate pedestrians. 
                  Utilities 
                  All utility installations within rights-of-way shall be consistent with the City of Jonesboro Development regulations. Underground utilities may cross under or run longitudinally under the pavement in residential subdivision streets, provided future utility stub-outs are installed prior to paving. Underground utilities may cross under all other streets and roadways, but may not run longitudinally under the pavement, except in unusual situations approved by the City Engineer. 
                  Lighting 
                  Shorter light standards located on a reduced spacing are preferable to fewer, taller, high-intensity light standards. The scale of lighting fixtures and the illumination provided must be appropriate for both pedestrian and vehicular movement. 
                  Design Guidelines by Street Classification 
                  Alleys 
                  Alleys provide access to residential and commercial properties, but are not designed to handle through traffic. Alleys are found primarily in single-family residential developments and serve as rear access to garages. Business owners sometime use alleys for locating dumpsters. Utilities are often provided in alleys to connect to the rear of homes or businesses. A minimum right-of-way of 20 feet is required, with a minimum pavement width of 12 feet. 
                  Lanes 
                  Lanes provide access to single-family dwellings and are generally two to six blocks in length. A street width of 18 feet is typical, with storm drainage addressed by curb and gutter. On-street parking is permitted, though usually limited to guests. Planting strips six feet in width parallel five-foot sidewalks that are located on both frontages. The design speed for lanes is 20 miles per hour (mph) and a 40-foot right-of-way is required. 
                  Streets 
                  Streets provide access to many forms of housing and are generally two to six blocks in length. Streets are 28 feet wide, with curb and gutter and on-street parking. Planting strips six feet in width and five-foot sidewalks on both sides of each frontage are typical. Design speed for streets is 20 mph and a 50-foot right of way is required. 
                  Avenues 
                  Avenues convey vehicular traffic over short distances at moderate speeds. These routes serve as connectors between neighborhoods and mixed-use and commercial centers. Avenues often lie along an important axis, terminating at prominent buildings or plazas. Avenues may also provide circulation around squares or neighborhood parks. 
                  Recommended street width is 26 feet on both sides of an 18-foot median. This configuration accommodates one 12-foot travel lane, a six-foot bike lane and an eight-foot parallel parking space. A minimum right-of-way of 98 feet and a maximum of two travel lanes are recommended. Planting strips with a width of six feet and eight-foot sidewalks are also recommended on each side. Design speed for avenues is 30 mph. 
                  Main Streets 
                  Main streets provide low-speed access to neighborhoods and high-density residential and commercial districts. A 66-foot right-of-way is required to accommodate sidewalks, curb and gutter and on-street parking, which is to be striped. Travel lanes on main streets are 11 feet and limited to two travel lanes. Bike lanes are optional, but if provided, a minimum width of six feet is recommended. Sidewalks having a minimum width of eight feet and installed on each side of the right-of-way are also recommended. Planting wells using six-foot tree grates are recommended rather than medians. Bike lanes are optional. 
                  Features unique to main streets are "bulb-outs" at intersections and mid-block crossings; both of which are intended to enhance pedestrian use and safety. Posted speeds should not exceed 25 mph. 
                  Parkways 
                  Parkways are designed to serve motorists at the edge of towns or in agricultural areas. They are used for travel into town, or for travel through natural areas. Parkways are not designed for developed areas as when the parkway enters town, these routes transition to a boulevard. 
                  Parkways require a minimum right-of-way of 118 feet. Travel lanes are typically 11—12 feet and a typical section uses a shoulder with ditches to accommodate runoff. Parkways can accommodate abundant pedestrian amenities; landscaped medians up to 30 feet wide, multi-use trails ranging from 10—14 feet in width, planting strips of 7—20 feet and bikeways separated from travel lanes are not uncommon. Storm water runoff can be addressed using swales or curb and gutter. The multi-use trails may be established on either or both sides of a parkway. 
                  A paved shoulder having a minimum width of six feet should be provided on high-speed parkways, that is, those with posted speeds greater than 45 mph. Maximum design speed for parkways is 50 mph. 
                  Jonesboro Thoroughfare Plan 
                  Standards and design criteria adopted by other jurisdictions can provide an appropriate frame of reference in considering local plans. However, this information must be tailored to the Jonesboro context. The following standards and design criteria are proposed: 
                  The Jonesboro Thoroughfare Plan establishes a street hierarchy comprised of Primary Arterial, Major Collector and Local Street. These are organized in order of size, with the Interstate conveying the highest traffic volumes and the highest speeds; local streets carry the lowest volumes and are characterized by the lowest speeds. Each street classification in the hierarchy is described below: 
                  •  Primary Arterial 
                  •  Major Collector 
                  •  Local Street 
                  Primary Arterials 
                  Arterials are designed to provide a high degree of mobility and serve longer vehicle trips to, from, and within urban areas. Arterials form the skeleton of the roadway network, linking urban centers such as the Central Business District, industrial parks, commercial centers, major residential developments and other key activity centers. Primary Arterials are designed to carry between 45,000 and 75,000 trips per day. The City of Jonesboro has only one Primary Arterial and that is Tara Boulevard (Highway 19/41). 
                  Major Collector Streets 
                  Collector streets link neighborhoods to commercial districts and commuter traffic to secondary arterials. These streets are well traveled and are built to an urban standard. Collector streets are typically two- to four-lane facilities with an average daily traffic count between 7,500 and 15,000 vehicles. The following streets comprise Jonesboro's Major Collector Streets: 
                  Fayetteville Road  North Avenue  North Main Street  South Main Street  McDonough Street  Smith Street  Stockbridge Road/Highway 138  Jodeco Road 
                  Local Streets 
                  Local streets serve neighborhoods and are generally arranged in a grid pattern although development out from Jonesboro's historic core tends to be served by curvilinear street patterns. These roads accommodate access to collector streets and local destinations at low speeds; sidewalks encourage pedestrian travel and community livability. Standards and design criteria pertaining to local streets are as follows: 
                  •  Local streets shall be limited to a two-lane section with a two foot curb and gutter on each frontage. 
                  •  Pavement sections shall be comprised of two 12-foot lanes with parking permitted. 
                  •  Stormwater runoff shall be addressed using drainage sales. 
                  •  Five-foot sidewalks shall be established on each frontage as well as landscaped strips having a minimum dimension of four feet. Shade trees shall be planted on 50-foot centers. 
                  •  Right-of-way required for a local street shall be a minimum of 50 feet. 
                  •  All local streets in the "town center" shall have sidewalks and pedestrian-scale street lights. 
                  The following streets comprise Jonesboro's local streets:
