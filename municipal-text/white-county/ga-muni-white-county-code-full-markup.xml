PREFACE

        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a complete codification of the general and permanent resolutions of White County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the resolutions of a general and permanent nature adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative table appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any resolution included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Ron K. McLaughlin, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
                  The publisher is most grateful to David Abercrombie, County Administrator, James E. Palmour, III, County Attorney, and Jean Welborn, County Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.

                  RESOLUTION NO. 97-17 
                  A RESOLUTION ADOPTING AND ENACTING AN OFFICIAL CODE FOR WHITE COUNTY, GEORGIA; PROVIDING FOR THE REPEAL OF CERTAIN RESOLUTIONS NOT INCLUDED THEREIN; PROVIDING A PENALTY FOR THE VIOLATION THEREOF; PROVIDING FOR THE MANNER OF AMENDING SUCH CODE; AND PROVIDING WHEN SUCH CODE AND THIS RESOLUTION SHALL BECOME EFFECTIVE. 
                  BE IT RESOLUTION BY THE WHITE COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS: 
                  Section 1. The Code entitled "The Official Code of White County, Georgia" published by Municipal Code Corporation consisting of chapters 1 through 66, each inclusive, is adopted. 
                  Section 2. All resolutions of a general and permanent nature enacted on or before February 4, 1997, and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein, are repealed. 
                  Section 3. The repeal provided for in section 2 hereof shall not be construed to revive any resolution or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent resolution that is repealed by this resolution. 
                  Section 4. Unless another penalty is expressly provided, every person convicted of a violation of any provision of the Code or any resolution, rule or regulation adopted or issued in pursuance thereof shall be punished by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisonment not exceeding 180 days, or both such fine and imprisonment. Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any Code section, whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory resolution. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the judge having jurisdiction may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief and revocation of licenses or permits. 
                  Section 5. Additions or amendments to the Code when passed in the form as to indicate the intention of the board of commissioners to make the same a part of the Code shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so the reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments. 
                  Section 6. Resolutions adopted after February 4, 1997, that amend or refer to resolutions that have been codified in the Code shall be construed as if they amend or refer to like provisions of the Code. 
                  Section 7. This resolution shall become effective October 7, 1997. 
                  Passed and adopted by the board of county commissioners this seventh day of October, 1997. 

                  Certificate of Adoption 
                  I hereby certify that the foregoing is a true copy of the resolution passed at the regular meeting of the board of county commissioners of White County, Georgia, held on the seventh day of October, 1997. 


                  SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
                    
                  The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code Book and are considered "Included." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code Book and are considered "Omitted." 
                  In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest resolution or ordinance included in the supplement.

                  (1)  Organize the resolution or ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions. 
                  (2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles. 
                  (3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers. 
                  (4)  Change the words "this resolution" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _____ to _____" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the resolution or ordinance incorporated into the Code). 
                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of resolution or ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of resolution or material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
                  Sec. 1-18. - Altering Code.

                  DIVISION 4. - TRAVEL REGULATIONS 

                  Sec. 2-131. - Introduction. 
                  These travel regulations are designed to assist county officials and employees (hereinafter called "employees") in the classified service that are required to travel away from their official headquarters during performing their official duties, and aid the finance department in the payment of travel expenses. Each employee required to travel is entitled to reimbursement for reasonable, necessary and allowable expenses incurred. A county employee on travel status, if accompanied by someone, who is not a county employee on travel status, will not be entitled to reimbursement for any expenses incurred for that person. These regulations are intended to indicate what constitutes reasonable and necessary expenses and to provide uniformity among the various departments of county government. These regulations are designed to encompass major areas pertaining to travel while allowing the department flexibility to deal with unusual travel circumstances that are not addressed herein by requesting specific authorization for deviations from the county manager. The flexibility of this system depends on the integrity of the employees to return all unused funds. 
                  (Res. No. 2006-5, 1-31-06) 
                  Sec. 2-132. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the county's purpose to allow travel arrangements on a limited basis provided: (a) travel appropriations are available, (b) travel is duly authorized and (c) travel is within the scope of the employee's employment and the discharge of his (her) official duties. Employees are expected to show good judgment and a proper regard for economy in incurring travel expenses. Required records must be kept of expenditures at the time incurred, submitted on the appropriate expense report and completed in strict accordance with these regulations. 
                  (Res. No. 2006-5, 1-31-06) 
                  Sec. 2-133. - Travel authorization. 
                  Employees required to travel in the performance of official duties and entitled to reimbursement for expenses incurred must receive prior authorization from their department director or elected official. Blanket authorization for routine travel may be granted. A list of signatures of approving officials should be made available to finance department personnel responsible for issuing reimbursement travel checks. 
                  The department director or elected official reflecting estimated cost, the destination and mode of transportation and general purpose of the travel, must specifically authorize all out-of-state travel in writing. All out-of-state travel should be filed with the finance department at least ten days prior to the trip. The aforementioned requirement for prior authorization of out-of-state travel pertains to ordinary anticipated travel such as workshops, conferences or seminars. Some travel, such as police investigations or prisoner transfers, by its very nature precludes a ten-day lead-time. This unforeseeable travel will be exempt from the prior authorization requirement; but the department director or elected official will be responsible for making certain that funds are available for these travel expenditures. 
                  (Res. No. 2006-5, 1-31-06) 
                  Sec. 2-134. - Subsistence. 
                  Reimbursement claims for subsistence (meals and lodging) are to be reported on an "employee travel expenses statement" by date, location and amount for each meal and lodging claimed. An individual taking annual leave while away from headquarters on official business is not entitled to subsistence for the period of leave. 
                  (1)  Meals. Per diem allotments of $30.00 per day will be made for meals, taxes and tips. 
                  Employees are entitled to reimbursement for breakfast expenses if they depart before 7:00 a.m. and for dinner expenses if they return later than 7:30 p.m. This entitlement is based on the premise that early departure and late return times as provided above are out of necessity and not at the discretion or convenience of the employee. 
                  As with all county expenditures, meal reimbursements are subject to verification and compliance with county financial policies, and are subject to approval by the department director and/or administration. All county expenditures and accounting are subject to the open records act. 
                  (2)  Lodging. Reimbursement may be made for actual lodging expenses based on reasonable rates. Receipts must document all lodging claims. Travelers should always make every effort to obtain suitable accommodations at the most economical rates available. It is expected that reservations will be made in advance whenever practical, that minimum rate accommodations available will be utilized, that "deluxe" hotels and motels will be avoided and that government rates will be obtained whenever possible. Many hotels and motels grant government rates to government employees upon request. Charges exceeding reasonable rates must be explained on the employee travel expense statement and approved by the finance department. More costly lodging may be justified to some extent if an employee stays at an expensive accommodation where a meeting is held in order to avoid excessive transportation cost between a lower cost motel and the location of the meeting. 
                  Local government officials and employees should not be charged local hotel/motel excise tax on lodging while traveling on official government business inside the state. The form "exemption of the local hotel/motel excise tax" is to be completed and presented at the hotel registration desk when registering. These forms can be obtained in the county commission office. When a room is shared with other county employees on travel status, reimbursement will be calculated, if practical, on a pro rata share of the total cost. A county employee on travel status, if accompanied by someone, who is not a county employee on travel status, will be entitled to reimbursement at a single room rate. Reimbursement for lodging should be limited to the minimum number of nights required to conduct the assigned county business. 
                  (Res. No. 2006-5, 1-31-06) 
                  Sec. 2-135. - Transportation. 
                  (a)  Vehicles. First priority for travel within the state should be given to use of county owned vehicles, if available. Otherwise, travelers may choose between using a personal vehicle or common carrier. Departments should approve transportation based on the most economical mode, consistent with the purpose of the travel. 
                  Effective February 1, 2006, the reimbursement for transportation expenses incurred by use of personally owned vehicles would be at the rate of 44.5 cents per mile. The initial point of departure should be the individual's residence or headquarters, whichever is nearer the destination point. When possible, employees should attempt to travel together to the same destination in one vehicle. 
                  Actual odometer readings will be reported; however, personal mileage will be excluded in determining the mileage for which reimbursement will be made. Claims exceeding mileage computed by the most direct route from the point of departure to destination (due to field visits, picking up passengers, etc.) must be explained on the employee travel expense statement. 
                  The authorized mileage rate is intended to cover the normal expenses incurred in the operation of a personal vehicle. In addition, parking and toll expenses will be paid for official travel in personal or county vehicles. A receipt should be provided when possible; if not, a written explanation should be included on the expense statement. The use of commercially leased vehicles will be left to the discretion of department personnel responsible for authorizing travel. Employees will be reimbursed for cost associated with the official use of such vehicles. Employees sharing a ride with another county employee using either a personal or county vehicle, and not claiming reimbursement for mileage, should indicate in the automobile mileage record section of the expense statement the name of the person they rode with and the date of the trip. 
                  (b)  Common carrier. Transportation by common carrier will be scheduled plane, bus or rail. Reimbursement will be made upon presentation of a ticket stub, receipt or other documentary evidence of expenditure. Officials or employees traveling by commercial air carrier will not be reimbursed for that portion of first class air fare that exceeds the amount of the lowest fare (tourist, etc.) for the flight on which such official or employee is traveling, unless space is not otherwise available. 
                  (c)  Shuttle/taxi service. Taxi service (when a more economical means is not available) will be reimbursed between the individual's departure point and the common carrier's departure point; between the common carrier's arrival point and the individual's lodging or meeting place; and between the lodging and meeting places if at different locations. It is expected that shuttle service will be utilized when available. Although receipts are not necessary for such items of transportation, a point-to-point explanation should be required for each such item reimbursed. 
                  (Res. No. 2006-5, 1-31-06) 
                  Sec. 2-136. - Miscellaneous expenses. 
                  Registration fees required for participation in workshops, seminars or conferences that an employee is directed and/or authorized to attend would be allowed when supported by a paid receipt or a copy of the check showing payment. Any part of a registration fee applicable to meals will be reported as meal expense and not as a registration fee if the cost can be separately identified. 
                  Expenses for official telephone and telegraph messages that must be paid for by the traveler are allowed. Reimbursement claims will indicate the location from which made, the person contacted and justification for communication. Postage expense incurred relative to travel will be allowed. Claims for laundry, valet service, theater, entertainment and alcoholic beverages will not be reimbursed. 
                  (Res. No. 2006-5, 1-31-06) 
                  Sec. 2-137. - Reimbursement procedures. 
                  A diligent effort should be made by department directors and persons responsible for approving claims for travel reimbursement to see that expense statements submitted are reasonable, accurate and cover only expenses actually incurred by an employee traveling in the interest of the county. When claims for reimbursement exceed established limits, a written explanation should be made on the statement explaining these higher amounts. These claims should be closely reviewed and department directors should adjust downward any excessive expenditure before approval and remittance to the finance department. 
                  (1)  Frequency. Employees should submit travel expense statements for reimbursement within one week after returning from the trip. 
                  (2)  Travel expense statement. Henceforth, employees requesting reimbursement for travel expenses must submit claims on the standard "employee travel expense statement" form (see example form on file in the office of the county clerk). 
                  (3)  Statement of propriety. Each county employee on travel status should consider seriously the wording of the statement to be signed in submitting a claim for reimbursement. The statement reads as follows: "I do solemnly swear under criminal penalty of a felony for false statements subject to punishment by fine of not more than $1,000.00 or by imprisonment for not less than one nor more than five years, that the above statements are true and have incurred the described expenses and the county use mileage in the discharge of my official duties for the county.

                  Sec. 2-241. - National anthem. 
                  (a)  Title. The composition consisting of the words and music known as The Star-Spangled Banner is designated the national anthem of the United States of America. 
                  (b)  Conduct during playing. During the rendition of the national anthem when the flag is displayed, all present except those in uniform should stand at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart. Men not in uniform should remove their headdress with their right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart. Persons in uniform should render the military salute at the first note of the anthem and retain this position until the last note. When the flag is not displayed, those present should face toward the music and act in the same manner they would if the flag were displayed there.

                  Sec. 2-242. - Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag; manner of delivery. 
                  The Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag, "I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all," should be rendered by standing at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart. When not in uniform men should remove their headdress with their right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart. Persons in uniform should remain silent, face the flag, and render the military salute.

                  Sec. 2-243. - Time and occasions for display. 
                  (a)  It is the universal custom to display the flag only from sunrise to sunset on buildings and on stationary flagstaffs in the open. However, when a patriotic effect is desired, the flag may be displayed 24 hours a day if properly illuminated during the hours of darkness. 
                  (b)  The flag should be hoisted briskly and lowered ceremoniously. 
                  (c)  The flag should not be displayed on days when the weather is inclement, except when all weather flag is displayed.

                  (Res. No. 2000-01, 1-4-00) 
                  Sec. 2-244. - Position and manner of display. 
                  The flag, when carried in a procession with another flag or flags, should be either on the marching right; that is, the flag's own right, or, if there is a line of other flags, in front or the center of that line. 
                  (1)  The flag should not be displayed on a float in a parade except form a staff, or as provided in subsection (9) of this section. 
                  (2)  The flag should not be draped over the hood, top, sides, or back of a vehicle or of a railroad train or a boat. When the flag is displayed on a motorcar, the staff shall be fixed firmly to the chassis or clamped to the right fender. 
                  (3)  No other flag or pennant should be placed above, or if on the same level, to the right of the flag of the United States of America, except during church services conducted by naval chaplains at sea, when the church pennant may be flown above the flag during church services for the personnel of the Navy. No person shall display the flag of the United Nations or any other national or international flag equal, above, or in a position of superior prominence or honor to, or in place of, the flag of the United States at any place within the United States or any Territory or possession thereof: Provided, that nothing in this section shall make unlawful the continuance of practice heretofore followed of displaying the flag of the United Nations in a position of superior prominence or honor, and other national flags in positions of equal prominence or honor, with that of the flag of the United States at the headquarters of the United Nations. 
                  (4)  The flag of the United States of America, when it is displayed with another flag against a wall from crossed staffs, should be on the right, the flag's own right, and its staff should be in front of the staff of the other flag. 
                  (5)  The flag of the United States of America should be at the center and at the highest point of the group when a number of flags of states or localities or pennants of societies are grouped and displayed from staffs. 
                  (6)  When flags of states, cities, or localities, or pennants of societies are flown on the same halyard with flag of the United States, the latter should always be at the peak. When the flags are flown from adjacent staffs, the flag of the United States should be hoisted first and lowered last. No such flag or pennant may be placed above the flag of the United States or to the United States flag's right. 
                  (7)  When flags of two or more nations are displayed, they are to be flown from separate staffs off the same height. The flags should be of approximately equal size. International usage forbids the display of the flag of one nation above that of another nation in time of peace. 
                  (8)  When the flag of the United States is displayed form a staff projecting horizontally or at an angle from the window sill, balcony, or front of a building, the union of the flag should be placed at the peak of the staff unless the flag is at half staff. When the flag is suspended over a sidewalk from a rope extending from a house to a pole at the edge of the sidewalk, the flag should be hoisted out, union first, from the building. 
                  (9)  When displayed either horizontally or vertically against a wall, the union should be uppermost and the flag's own right, that is, to the observer's left. When displayed in a window, the flag should be displayed in the same way, with the union or blue field to the left of the observer in the street. 
                  (10)  When the flag is displayed over the middle of the street, it should be suspended vertically with the union to the north in an east and west street or the east in a north and south street. 
                  (11)  When used on a speaker's platform, the flag, if displayed flat, should be displayed above and behind the speaker. When displayed from a staff in a church or public auditorium, the flag of the United States of America should hold the position of superior prominence, in advance of the audience, and in the position of honor at the clergyman's or speaker's right as he faces the audience. Any other flag so displayed should be placed on the left of the clergyman or speaker or to the right of the audience. 
                  (12)  The flag should form a distinctive feature of the ceremony of unveiling a statue or monument, but it should never be used as the covering of the statue or monument. 
                  (13)  The flag, when flown at half-staff, should be first hoisted to the peak for an instant and then lowered to the half-staff position. The flag should be again raised to the peak before it is lowered for the day. On Memorial Day the flag should be displayed at half-staff until noon only, then raised to the-top of the staff. By order of the president, the flag shall be flown at half-staff upon the death of principal figures of the United States government and the governor of a state, territory, or possession, as a mark of respect to their memory. In the event of the death of other officials or foreign dignitaries, the flag is to be displayed at half-staff according to presidential instructions or orders, or in accordance with recognized customs or practices not inconsistent with law. In the event of the death of a present or former official of the government of any state, territory, or possession of the United States, the governor of that state, territory, or possession may proclaim that the national flag shall be flown at half-staff. The flag shall be flown at half-staff 30 days from the death of the president or former president; ten days from the day of death of the vice president, the chief of justice or a retired chief justice of the United States, or the speaker of the house of representatives; from the day of death until interment of an associate justice of the supreme court, a secretary of an executive or military department, a former vice president, or the governor of a state, territory, or possession; and the day of death and the following day for a member of congress. The flag shall be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers Memorial Day, unless that day is also Armed Forces Day. The flag will be flown at half-staff for one hour before the memorial service through the conclusion of the memorial service for those White County, City of Cleveland and City of Helen employees killed in the line of duty. On those other occasions when an active employee dies whether at work or not, a wreath will be placed at the base of the flag pole located in front of the each governing authorities office. As used in this subsection: 
                  a.  The term "half-staff" means the position of the flag when it is one-half the distance between the top and bottom of the staff; 
                  b.  The term "executive department" means the department of state, treasury, defense, justice, interior, agriculture, commerce, labor, health and human services, department of housing and urban development, transportation, energy, education, and veterans affairs; 
                  c.  The term "military department" means the department of the Army, Navy and Air Force; and 
                  d.  The term "member of congress" means a senator, a representative, a delegate, or the resident commissioner for Puerto Rico. 
                  (14)  When the flag is used to cover a casket, it should be so placed that the union is at the head and over the left shoulder. The flag should not be lowered into the grave or allowed to touch the ground. 
                  (15)  When the flag is suspended across a corridor or lobby in a building with only one main entrance, it should be suspended vertically with the union of the flag to the observer's left upon entering. If the building has more than one main entrance, the flag should be suspended vertically near the center of the corridor or lobby with the union to the north, when entrances are to the east and west or to the east when entrances are to the north and south. If there are entrances in more than two directions, the union should be to the east. 
                  (Res. No. 2000-01, 1-4-00) 
                  Sec. 2-245. - Respect for flag. 
                  No disrespect should be shown to the flag of the United States of America; the flag should not be dipped to any person or thing. Regimental colors, state flags, and organization or institutional flags are to be dipped as a mark of honor. 
                  (1)  The flag should never be displayed with the union down, except as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property. 
                  (2)  The flag should never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or merchandise. 
                  (3)  The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free. 
                  (4)  The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery. It should never be festooned, drawn back, nor up, in folds, but always allowed to fall free. Bunting of blue, white, and red, always arranged with the blue above, the white in the middle, and the red below, should be used for covering a speaker's desk, draping the front of the platform, and for decoration in general. 
                  (5)  The flag should never be fastened, displayed, used, or stored in such a manner as to permit it to be easily torn, soiled, or damaged in any way. 
                  (6)  The flag should never be used as a covering for a ceiling. 
                  (7)  The flag should never have placed upon it, nor on any part of it, not attached to it any mark, insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture, or drawing of any nature. 
                  (8)  The flag should never be used as a receptacle for receiving, holding, caring, or delivering anything. 
                  (9)  The flag should never be used for advertising purposes in any manner whatsoever. It should not be embroidered on such articles as cushions or handkerchiefs and the like, printed or otherwise impressed on paper napkins or boxes or anything that is designed for temporary use and discard. Advertising signs should not be fastened to a staff or halyard from which the flag is flown. 
                  (10)  No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform. However, a flag patch may be affixed to the uniform of military personnel, firemen, policemen, and members of patriotic organizations. The flag represents a living country and is itself considered a living thing. Therefore, the lapel pin being a replica, should be worn on the left lapel near the heart. 
                  (11)  The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning.

                  Sec. 2-246. - Conduct during hoisting, lowering or passing of flag. 
                  During the ceremony of hoisting or lowering the flag or when the flag is passing in a parade or in review, all persons present, except those in uniform, should face the flag and stand at attention with the right hand over the heart. Those present in uniform should render the military salute. When not in uniform, men should remove their headdress with their right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart. Aliens should stand at attention. The salute to the flag in a moving column should be rendered at the moment the flag passes. 
                  (Res. No. 2000-01, 1-4-00) 
                  Sec. 2-247. - Flag presentation. 
                  Presentation of the flag during a ceremony should be preceded by a brief talk emphasizing the importance of the occasion. Following the presentation all present should salute the flag, recite the pledge of allegiance, and sing the national anthem.

                  Sec. 2-248. - Folding the flag. 
                  (a)  Two persons, facing each other, hold the flag waist high and horizontally between them. 
                  (b)  The lower striped section is folded, lengthwise, over the blue field. Hold bottom to top and edges together securely. 
                  (c)  Fold the flag again, lengthwise, folded edge to open edge. 
                  (d)  A triangular fold is started along the length of the flag, from the end to the heading by bringing the striped corner of the folded edge to meet the open edge. 
                  (e)  The outer point is turned inward parallel with the open edge, forming a second triangle. 
                  (f)  Repeat the triangular folding until the entire length of the flag is folded. 
                  (g)  When the flag is completely folded only the triangular blue field should be visible.

                  Editor's note— Res. No. 2003-17, §§ I—III, adopted April 1, 2003, did not specifically amend the Code. Hence its inclusion herein as article VII, sections 2-271—2-273, was at the discretion of the editor. 

                  Sec. 2-271. - Conduct during meetings. 
                  During the public portions of public meetings and public hearings, elected officials of the county shall not: 
                  (1)  Speak without first being recognized by the chair; 
                  (2)  Interrupt anyone who has the floor; 
                  (3)  Use profanity during the public portion of any meeting; 
                  (4)  Refuse to yield the floor, or argue with the chair, if he is ruled out of order by the chair; 
                  (5)  Make disparaging remarks about any person's character during the public portion of any meeting. By way of example, it would be permissible to say "I don't believe that" or "I cannot accept that," but it is improper to say "He's a liar," or "He can't be trusted." Remarks should be limited to the subject under discussion, and shall not address the character of the persons involved. Nothing herein shall limit or restrict the free and open debate of these matters in executive or closed sessions. 
                  (6)  Confront anyone about a prior statement in an accusatory manner during the public portion of any meeting. By way of example, it would be permissible to ask someone if something different had been said on a prior occasion, and the question should be phrased "Did you tell me ________?" or "Do you remember telling me ________?" It is impermissible to say "Didn't you tell me ________," or "Why did you tell me ________ before the meeting?" The purpose of the public portion of a meeting is to allow each elected official, town representatives and members of the public to state their positions in an orderly fashion; it is not a trial where persons are to be cross-examined, interrogated, belittled or held out to public ridicule or embarrassment. Nothing herein shall limit or restrict the free and open debate of these matters in executive or closed session. 
                  (7)  State during the public portion of any meeting that a county employee has not done his or her job, or has not done his or her job properly. By way of example, it would be permissible to ask if a county employee did or did not do a specific task, but the question must be phrased in such a way that a simple "yes" or "no" answer is all that is requested. It would also be permissible to state or comment that a job was not done, or that it was not done correctly, so long as the person responsible is not singled out for blame; remarks concerning the subject of job performance are proper, but negative references to the person responsible are not. It is not proper to accuse county employees of not doing their jobs, or doing them improperly, during the public portions of the meeting. County employees shall not be placed in the position of responding to accusations of wrongdoing by an elected official during the public portion of a meeting (unless the meeting has been called as a hearing for the express purpose of determining disciplinary action), nor shall their integrity or competency be challenged by an elected official during the public portion of any meeting. Nothing herein shall limit or restrict the free and open debate of these matters in executive or closed session. 
                  (8)  Represent their personal position or beliefs as being the position or beliefs of the commission as a whole. By way of example, unless and until a majority vote has been obtained on a specific issue, an elected official shall not state that the commission will or will not do something, nor shall an elected official state what the commission's vote will be on an issue. No single elected official can speak on behalf of the commission unless specifically authorized by majority vote to do so. 
                  (9)  Refuse to recognize the validity of action approved by majority vote of the commission. By way of example, an elected official is free to state that he does not agree with the majority vote, or that he would like to see the majority reconsider its action and vote a different way. However, an elected official shall not refuse to sign any ordinance, resolution, contract or other legal document because he did not vote for the action taken. The minutes shall reflect his opposition to the majority's decision, but he shall not be authorized to withhold his signature on the basis that he did not vote for the action taken. 
                  (10)  Divulge the subject matter of any confidential information, legal advice, or strategy discussions revealed during an executive session called for the purpose of discussing actual or potential litigation against the county or any county employee. There may be occasions when an elected official will be asked to make a specific commitment to this rule in connection with a particular case. If an elected official is unwilling to pledge his commitment to the other members of the commission, he shall be excluded from participating in that portion of the executive session. 
                  (Res. No. 2003-17, § I, 4-1-03; Res. No. 2007-1, § I, 1-9-07) 
                  Sec. 2-272. - Conduct outside of meetings. 
                  An elected official of commission shall not: 
                  (1)  Direct any department head or county employee to do a job or perform a task. All such requests shall be made to the county administrator. Once such a request is made, the elected official shall follow up with the county administrator regarding the performance of the work, not with the department head or county employee whom the elected official expects to do the job. If the job is not performed to the elected official's satisfaction, this shall be taken up with the county administrator first; if the elected official is still not satisfied, the matter shall next be discussed with all members of the commission in executive session, under the exemption to the Open Meetings Act for discussion of employee performance. There shall be no criticism or disparaging remarks made about any county employee in a public meeting unless and until all of these steps have been exhausted. 
                  (2)  Publicly state that he intends to fire or discipline any county employee. No single elected official has the authority to hire or fire county personnel. 
                  (3)  Reprimand any county employee. If an elected official believes a county employee should be reprimanded he shall so inform the county administrator. If an elected official believes the county administrator should be reprimanded he shall notify the other members of the commission. No single elected official has the authority to discipline county personnel. 
                  (4)  Use profanity, insulting or demeaning words about a county employee in the presence of that employee, or in the presence of any other county employee. 
                  (5)  Call into question the qualifications or competency of a county employee in the presence of that employee, or in the presence of any other county employee. Concerns of this nature shall be addressed in the stages outlined in subsection (1), above. 
                  (6)  Demand that the county manager or any department head stop what he or she is doing and immediately attend to the elected official's business. If the county manager or a department head requests that the elected official schedule a time to discuss a matter that is mutually convenient to all concerned, the elected official shall honor that request. 
                  (7)  Agree to buy or sell anything of value on behalf of the county without advance approval by a majority vote of the county commission. 
                  (8)  Attempt to negotiate county business with any private party or any representative of another governmental unit without the advance approval of a majority of the county commission. By way of example, it is permissible for any elected official to discuss county business in general terms with private parties and representatives of other governmental units (unless there is actual or threatened litigation against the county by the parties involved). However, an elected official shall not make any written offers, draft any agreements, edit or revise any proposed agreements or plans, or suggest or propose (whether orally or in writing) any specific terms concerning money or services to be provided or received by the county unless that elected official has received express authorization in advance by a majority vote of the county commission. The fact that the subject matter involves property or persons in an elected official's district is of no consequence, as an elected official has no additional legal authority over a matter simply because it is in his district. 
                  (9)  Speak to any representative of the news media on behalf of the county or the commission without advance approval by majority vote of the commission. By way of example, an elected official is free to express his personal views or opinions to anyone. However, an elected official shall not make a statement in the name of the county commission or in the name of the county unless he has been authorized in advance to do so by majority vote of the county commission. 
                  (10)  Speak with any other commissioner about county business outside of a regular work session or regular commission meeting that is in any way in violation of the "Sunshine Law of the State of Georgia." This in no way prevents two or more commissioners from being together at social functions or being together without others present, as long as what is commonly called the Sunshine Law of the State of Georgia is not violated. 
                  (Res. No. 2003-17, § II, 4-1-03; Res. No. 2007-1, § II, 1-9-07) 
                  Sec. 2-273. - Penalties. 
                  The county commission shall have the responsibility to police itself and to enforce this resolution. Any elected official shall have the right to bring a suspected violation of this resolution to the attention of the full commission. Any such accusation may be deliberated upon in executive session, but a vote upon any penalty to be imposed must be taken in open, public session, with all members of the commission present. If the commission determines by majority vote that a violation of this resolution has occurred, the commission shall have the authority to impose one or more of the following penalties upon the offending elected official: 
                  (1)  A verbal censure that shall be noted in the minutes without further elaboration; 
                  (2)  A written censure, to be made a part of the minutes, specifically outlining the facts underlying the violation; 
                  (3)  Removal of the elected official from membership on any committee, association or group in which the offending elected official is involved in his capacity as a county elected official; removal shall take place by the delivery of a letter, signed by the commission, to the head of such committee, association or group, stating that the offending elected official is no longer authorized to represent the county. This sanction shall last for a period of up to one year from the date of offense.

                  Adequate food means a sufficient quantity of noncontaminated and nutritionally healthy sustenance that is appropriate to the species, breed, size, age and health of the animal, or at the direction of a licensed veterinarian, which is sufficient to prevent starvation, malnutrition, or risk to the animal's health. Garbage, spoiled, rancid or contaminated food is not adequate food. 
                  Adequate shelter means a protective covering for a domestic animal that is of adequate size and provides adequate protection to maintain the domestic animal in a state of good health and that prevents pain, suffering or significant risk to the animal's health. It should also be clean, dry and compatible with current weather conditions and to the breed of the domestic animal. The structure should be of sufficient size to allow the dog to stand, turn around, lie down and go in and out of the structure comfortably. The shelter should have proper bedding, ventilation, and lighting and afford the animal protection from extreme cold or hot temperatures. Examples of inadequate shelter include, but are not limited to, pet carriers, boxes, porches, decks or material that does not provide sufficient protection from the elements.

                  ARTICLE II. - ANIMAL CONTROL 

                  Sec. 10-31. - Running at large prohibited; duties of animal owners. 
                  (a)  It shall be the duty of the owner of any animal or anyone having an animal in his possession to keep the animal under control at all times while the animal is off the real property limits of the owner, possessor or custodian. For the purposes of this section, an animal is deemed under control when it is confined within a vehicle; is secured by a leash or other device held by a competent person; is under voice control or is properly confined within an enclosure with permission of the owner of the property where the enclosure is located. 
                  (b)  The owner or custodian of any animal that is proven to be at large shall be in violation of this section, regardless of the precautions taken to prevent the escape of the animal and regardless of lack of knowledge of the offense at the time it occurs. 
                  (c)  Any such animal at large may be impounded by the animal control officer or an authorized representative thereof. 
                  (d)  It shall be the duty of every owner or custodian of an animal or livestock within the county to exercise reasonable care and take all necessary steps and precautions to protect other people and property from injuries and damage which might result from the animal's behavior, regardless of whether such behavior is motivated by mischievousness, playfulness or ferocity. Every animal shall be restrained or controlled so as to prevent it from chasing vehicles or chasing, menacing, or attacking persons or other animals. Citation under this section shall not replace or be a substitute for enforcement of the section of this chapter dealing with dangerous or vicious dogs, and an owner may be subject to enforcement under both sections. 
                  (e)  It shall be the responsibility of every owner of a domesticated animal to notify animal control if an animal is missing. 
                  (f)  It shall be the duty of any animal owner or person residing with an animal owner to respond within 24 hours, or no later than 10:00 a.m. of the next business day, whichever is later, to a notice or request for information from animal control left or posted at the premises on or near where an animal is living or kept. The notice, which shall not be a citation, shall be posted prominently in full view, or left with an adult on the premises, may be delivered as part of an investigation, as the result of a complaint, or part of a follow up, and requires a response, either in person or by telephone. If the response is by telephone, any message left must provide a return number or other reliable way to make contact. Each notice that is ignored shall constitute a separate offense. 
                  (g)  Except as provided in the following section, every owner of an unsterilized animal, i.e., a dog, cat or ferret, is hereby required to confine the animal at all times. Confinement shall include keeping the animal within a fence, a proper enclosure, a house, other enclosure or structure that affords the animal humane care and in all cases prevents access to other animals not kept in the same enclosure. Any time an unsterilized animal is not confined, the animal must be on a secure and sturdy leash while being walked by a responsible person. Any unsterilized animal that is unconfined or not on a leash shall be subject to confiscation and impoundment, and, in addition to being subject to citation, the owner shall be required to have the animal sterilized within 30 days. The burden shall be on the owner of a sterilized animal to have proof available that the animal is sterilized. 
                  (h)  Unsterilized working animals (including show dogs) are exempt from the above confinement requirements while working, but their owners are required to keep such animals under control. The burden shall be on the owners to prove the animal was working at the time of the citation. Owners who negligently allow working animals to roam and run free at any time shall be subject to citation and sterilization under this section and under any other applicable section of this article. 
                  (i)  It is the policy of animal control that tethering an animal as a permanent means of confinement is an unsafe, unwise, and dangerous practice. In the event an owner uses a tether to confine an animal, it shall be of sufficient construction as to not constitute abuse or a danger to the animal and shall allow the animal sufficient freedom to safely perform its necessary activities and functions in the judgment of animal control. Improper, inhumane, and unsafe tethering as a permanent means of confinement shall be considered animal cruelty. 
                  (j)  It shall be unlawful for the owner of any dog or anyone having a dog in his possession and control to permit the dog to be out of control off the premises of the owner, or upon the property of another person without permission of the owner or person in possession thereof. 
                  (k)  A dog within the property limits of its owner or custodian shall be under the immediate supervision of a responsible party when invitees are allowed on the property by owner. 
                  (l)  No person shall tie, stake or fasten any animal within any street, alley, sidewalk or other public place or in such manner that the animal has access to any portion of any street, alley, sidewalk or other public place. 
                  (m)  Every female dog or cat in heat shall be confined in a building or other enclosure in such manner that such female dog or cat cannot come into contact with a male animal except for planned breeding. Appropriate confinement does not include, among other things, tethering. No owner or custodian of any dog in heat shall permit the dog to roam or leave the property of its owner. 
                  (n)  Every animal shall be restrained or controlled so as to prevent it from chasing vehicles or attacking persons or other domestic animals. 
                  (o)  Any animal with no known keeper (e.g., feral cats) shall be considered stray and subject to impoundment.

                  (a)  All livestock shall be properly housed with adequate food and adequate water and confined within a fenced enclosure. The fenced enclosure shall be maintained in such a manner as to keep any average livestock animal from escaping the enclosed compound and causing damage, accidents or injury to any person or property. Owners of such livestock shall be liable for any damage, accidents or injuries. Such maintenance shall include, but not be limited to, repair or replacement of anchor post assemblies whenever they show signs of weakness, refastening loose wires to posts, splicing broken wires when necessary, and keeping the fence wires properly stretched. Those who provide boarding/pasturing space and/or services for hire shall have the responsibility for enclosure maintenance as described in this paragraph. 
                  (b)  Owners or possessors of livestock impounded for violation of this article or any state and/or federal laws, will be charged in accordance with actual costs of impoundment plus impounding and boarding fees, as adopted by the board of commissioners. 
                  (c)  Impounded livestock shall be held for a period of five days. If such impounded animals are not claimed by the owner during that period of time, the animals may be given to persons willing to accept them, in the discretion of the director of animal control. 
                  (d)  It shall be unlawful to tether any equine species outdoors without the owner or adult custodian being with the equine species. Any person owning an equine species needs to provide adequate and proper fencing to keep the equine enclosed safely.

                  Sec. 10-33. - Abandonment of animals.

No person shall put out or abandon any dog, cat or other domestic animal on public or private property. It shall be unlawful for anyone to abandon any domesticated animal within the county. Each person who does abandon, permits such abandonment or aids in the abandonment of any domesticated animal shall be in violation of the law and shall be punished as provided in this article.

                  (c)  It shall be unlawful for the owner of any animal or fowl that die or are killed within the limits of the county to fail to remove or bury the carcass of such animal within a reasonable time and, in no event, more than 24 hours after its death. 
                  (d)  If the owner, possessor or custodian of an animal is not known and the animal is upon the public streets, alleys, sidewalks, school grounds or other public places or premises or property of another without the property owner's permission as prohibited by this section, any law enforcement officer or agent or employee duly authorized by the county shall be authorized to immediately take possession of such animal and impound it in accordance with the rules and regulations provided by law or by ordinance of the county for the detention, control and disposition of animals. 
                  (e)  Once impounded, an animal shall be kept for a period of time as outlined in this article and, thereafter, if the animal is not claimed by anyone after a reasonable effort has been made to locate the owner, possessor or custodian of the animal as provided in this article, the animal may be disposed of via adoption, transfer to rescue group or licensed veterinarian, or if in the opinion of the shelter director or a licensed accredited veterinarian, such animal has a temperament or condition such that euthanasia is the only reasonable course of action, by humanely disposing of the animal.

                  (Res. No. 2005-14, 7-5-05) 
                  Sec. 14-133. - General design and development requirements. 
                  (a)  Suitability of land. Land subject to flooding, improper drainage, or erosion or that is for topographical or other reasons unsuitable for use shall not be developed for a recreational park trailer/recreational vehicle park use or for any other use that will continue or increase the danger to health, safety, or property destruction or the environment unless the hazards can be and are corrected. Properties affected by the county's environmental planning standards shall also be identified and appropriately protected in the development review process. Lands deemed un-developable are found as portions of a large number of development projects, and shall be set aside as protected open space. 
                  (b)  Land area and frontage requirements. A recreational park trailer/recreational vehicle development shall have a minimum of five contiguous acres and a total property width of at least 200 feet in order to allow for a minimum of two tiers of lots. The property shall be a minimum contiguous width of 60 feet wide where it directly abuts a paved public street or a class I street. A recreational vehicle park development shall be accessed by a public street, class I street, or a previously approved access of at least a 30-foot easement (a private street). The 30-foot easement must meet minimum subdivision regulations. 
                  (c)  Name of the development. The name of the development must have been approved by the planning commission. The name shall not duplicate nor closely approximate the name of an existing development or subdivision. 
                  (d)  Lot size and frontage requirements. 
                  (1)  Except as to seasonal worker lots as set out in subsection (2) below, each recreational park trailer/recreational vehicle lot designed for rental use shall have a minimum width of 80 feet and shall directly abut an interior street. Each rental lot shall have a minimum area of at least 10,000 square feet. Lots designated as lots for sale where urban scale public water is provided shall have a minimum lot area of at least one-acre minimum, or greater, sufficient for installation of an appropriate septic/drain field and alternate drain field site. Lots proposed for sale where no public water is available shall be on a central system and shall be a minimum lot width of 150 feet, and shall directly abut an interior street. Said lots shall contain at least one acre of area minimum or greater sufficient for installation of an appropriate septic/drain field and alternate drain field site. 
                  (2)  Up to eight lots for seasonal workers shall be allowed. Seasonal worker lots shall be specifically located together in a single location and shall abut an interior street. Seasonal worker lots shall have a width no less than 30 feet and a length no less than 100 feet. Said sites shall be for temporary seasonal use for park workers and not to be rented for customer use. The area for seasonal worker lots shall contain an area sufficient for installation of an appropriate septic/drain field and alternate drain field site approved by the county health department. 
                  (e)  Parking. Off street parking shall be provided at the rate of one parking space per site. This is in addition to the area set aside for the recreational park trailer/recreational vehicle. 
                  (f)  Recreation and other community facilities. Not less than 15 percent of the total area of the rental development shall be devoted to recreation and other community facilities for those all recreational park trailer/recreational vehicle parks. 
                  (g)  Setbacks. No recreational park trailer/recreational vehicle or other building or structure shall be located closer than 30 feet to any perimeter park boundaries, and no closer than five feet from any individual lot boundary line. Building setbacks for parks developed after April 3, 2007 shall be 30 feet to any perimeter park boundary; all other lot setbacks shall be 15 feet. Setbacks shall apply to the recreational park trailer/recreational vehicle and any slide outs, when fully extended, buildings, structures and fuel supply apparatuses. 
                  (h)  Location permits and propane tank limitations. Location permits are required before placement of any recreational vehicle park/recreational vehicle to insure that the setbacks dictated in this division are met. Initial sighting of a recreational vehicle on any individually owned lot will require the staking of the lot corners to simplify inspection. These initial location or placement requirements are placed on both the individual property owners and the developer/homeowners association. Building inspection staff shall also insure compliance with the county's propane tank number/size limitations at the final sighting inspection. The county hereby prohibits any more than three 40-pound (approximate 10 gallon each) freestanding propane tanks on any RV site, including those for gas grills, exterior gas lighting and other such uses. Tanks installed by the manufacturer subject to ANSI standards are not subject to these limitations. Location of allowed propane and other fuel storage containers shall be subject to the RV setback requirements. Location inspection fees shall be as established from time to time by the county board of commissioners. 
                  (i)  Perimeter screening required. A landscape buffer consisting of dense evergreen trees and/or shrubs and having a minimum depth of ten feet along all property lines shall be required. A minimum of a six-foot high, opaque fence or wall may be erected along the perimeter in lieu of such landscaped buffer. Landscape screening shall include evergreen plants that will obtain a height of six feet within four years. The owner(s) and/or developer shall be responsible for the installation and maintenance of any trees and/or shrubbery used for perimeter screening. Installation of the required buffer is required prior to the issuance of any initial building or location permits. 
                  (j)  Covenants. If covenants are proposed for the development, they must be submitted with the final plat. If no covenants are to be placed upon the project, a letter to that effect must be submitted for the project file. 
                  (k)  Structures and buildings. No permanent buildings and non-motorized vehicles, except those falling under the definition of recreational park trailer and/or recreational vehicles shall be permitted on any rental lot. No buildings shall be allowed on rental lots and structures consisting of open decks may be allowed on rental lots not to exceed 200 square feet, or ten percent of the lot area, whichever is less. If the lots are sold for individual ownership, permanent buildings shall be limited to 400 square feet. Structures consisting of open decks may be allowed up to an additional 400 square feet or 20 percent of the lot area, whichever is greater. All buildings shall not be used for permanent habitation. Construction of any building or structure shall require a location or placement review for compliance with setback requirements as part of the footing inspection, which shall be handled in the same manner as detailed in section 14-128(a). 
                  (l)  Use of impervious surface materials. One of the major challenges faced in RV parks, due to their compact nature, is the control of stormwater runoff and protecting areas of the park on both individual lots and in common spaces to promote infiltration of rainwater and stormwater, as well as wastewater effluent. Due to this special need identified in this compact development type, impervious surface, which is recommended primarily for parking pads, shall be limited to 20 percent of total lot area. The use of gravel and other porous materials is strongly encouraged in lieu of paving whenever feasible. 
                  (m)  Health department approval. all final plans must have health department approval and must show the approval stamp from that department prior to the filing of the final development plan/plat. 
                  (n)  Public works approval. All final plans must have public works/engineering approval and must show the approval stamp from that department prior to the filing of the final development plan/plat.

The base course shall consist of graded aggregate of a thickness of at least four inches or more and be in conformance with the attached cross section. 
                  (2)  Pipes or culverts. All pipe sizes shall be approved by the public works department/engineer to meet the drainage requirements of the development, as well as potential run-off naturally occurring on the site and adjacent properties. 
                  (3)  Street grades. Street grades shall not exceed 15 percent and not less than one percent. 
                  (4)  Cul-de-sac requirements. All streets that have a closed end or dead-end shall be provided with a turn-around or cul-de-sac that shall have a minimum radius of 39 feet. Each cul-de-sac shall have a minimum radius of 35 feet of pavement.

                  (2)  Secondary numbers may be used when a number of units, structures and uses coexist on the same parcel of land. Examples of parcels requiring secondary numbers include apartment projects, condominium projects, mobile home parks, office parks, planned unit developments, recreational vehicle parks, recreational areas, shopping centers and other uses where the use of secondary numbers would clarify the location of a unit or used for public safety purposes. To provide secondary numbers, the administering department shall work with the owner, manager or person in charge of the project to determine a logical numbering system under the following guidelines: 
                  a.  Existing numbered units and uses shall retain the present set of addresses with only the primary number being changed if the primary number is not in sequence with the overall system. 
                  b.  Buildings on a single parcel with more than one and less than five units may be given either letter (preferred) or number designations as determined by the planning department or its designated representative. 
                  c.  A single building on a single parcel of land and with five or more units may be given numerical designations such as Suite 5, Apartment 5, etc., if so desired. 
                  d.  Multiple buildings on the same parcel of land may be given secondary numbers consisting of number designations if the buildings are accessed from a main entrance to the project. Generally the number designations should increase in a clockwise direction from the main entrance. 
                  e.  Mobile home parks, recreational vehicle parks and similar uses shall be given number designation for individual lots or sites.

                  b.  Telecommunication towers must be set back a distance equal to the total height of the tower from any adjacent property line as measured radially from the base of the tower to the property line of the subject property. 
                  c.  The following setback requirements shall apply to all telecommunications facilities, provided, however, that the director may reduce the standard setback requirements of this section if the goals of this article would be better served thereby. 
                  1.  Telecommunications towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower from any off-site residential and non-residential structures. 
                  2.  Towers, guy wires and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum building setback requirements. 
                  d.  For antennas attached to the roof or a supporting structure on a rooftop, a 1:1 setback ration (example: ten-foot high antenna and supporting structure requires ten-foot setback from edge of roof) shall be maintained unless an alternative placement is shown to reduce visual impact. 
                  (12)  Additional requirements for towers. 
                  a.  Site location and development shall preserve the preexisting character of the surrounding buildings and land as much as possible. Personal wireless telecommunication towers shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical. 
                  b.  At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower and related facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
                  c.  In no case shall a tower be located in the required front yard, back yard or side yard in a residential lot. 
                  d.  Towers shall not be sited where they will negatively affect any historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or any state or federal law or agency or where they will create visual clutter. 
                  e.  Towers shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing not less than six (6) feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device or other similar protective device designed to prevent tower access. 
                  f.  Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided all setback, design and landscape requirements are met as to each tower. Structures may be located as close to each other as technically feasible, provided tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one fails.

                  ARTICLE III. - CONTINUITY OF GOVERNMENT PLAN 

                  Sec. 18-51. - Purpose. 
                  A major disaster could include death or injury of key officials, partial or complete destruction of established seats of government, and the destruction of public and private records essential to continued operations of government and industry. Law and order must be preserved and government services maintained. Applicable portions of the Georgia Code and the constitution of the state provide authority for the continuity and preservation of local government. 
                  Continuity of leadership and government authority is particularly important with respect to emergency services, direction of emergency response operations, and management of recovery operations. To this end, it is particularly essential that the county continue to function as a government entity. 
                  Under the state's concept of mutual aid, local officials remain in control of their jurisdiction's emergency operations while others may provide additional resources upon request. A key aspect of this control is to be able to communicate official requests, situation reports and other emergency information throughout any disaster situation. 
                  To ensure continuity of government, government at all levels must address seven elements: 
                  (1)  Succession of officers; 
                  (2)  Seat of government; 
                  (3)  Emergency powers and authority; 
                  (4)  Emergency plans; 
                  (5)  Primary and alternate emergency operations center(s); 
                  (6)  Preservation of vital records; 
                  (7)  Protection of critical infrastructure; 
                  (Res. No. 2008-3, 1-8-08) 
                  Sec. 18-52. - Succession of officers heading departments. 
                  Georgia Code permits the political subdivision to provide for the succession of officers who head departments having duties in the maintenance of law and order or in the furnishing of public services relating to health and safety. The succession list is for the primary county emergency response functions. 
                  (1)  Standby officers. Georgia Code permits the government body to appoint standby officers for each member of the governing body and up to three standby officers for the political subdivision's chief executive. The standby officer has have the same authority and powers as the regular officers. 
                  (2)  Reconstituting the governing body with temporary officers. Georgia Code establishes a method for reconstituting the governing body. It authorizes that, should all members of the governing body, including all standby members, be unavailable, temporary officers shall be appointed by the governor. 
                  (3)  Meeting of government body during an emergency. Georgia Code directs local governing bodies to convene as soon as possible whenever a state of emergency or local emergency exists and at a place not necessarily within the political subdivision. 
                  (4)  Duties of governing body during an emergency. Georgia Code provides that the duties of the governing body during emergencies shall include ascertaining the damage to the political subdivision and its personnel and property, reconstituting itself and the political subdivision, and performing functions in preserving law and order and furnishing local services.

                  Sec. 18-54. - Seat of government. 
                  In general, the seat of county government is that place where the board of commissioners is sitting and meeting. That place is: 
                  White County Courthouse  59 South Main Street, Ste A  Cleveland, Georgia 30528 
                  The chairman, or any other member of the board of commissioners may designate alternate or temporary seats of county government should that be necessary. The seat of county government may be the EOC, or its alternate location, during an extreme emergency.

                  Sec. 18-55. - Emergency powers and authority. 
                  The Georgia Emergency Management Act grants emergency powers to county leadership. Authority to take extraordinary measures during emergencies derives from county emergency ordinances and emergency orders that are authorized by the Georgia Emergency Management Act. 
                  (Res. No. 2008-3, 1-8-08) 
                  Sec. 18-56. - Emergency plans. 
                  The basis for a coordinated, effective response to a disaster is the emergency plan. Generally, the objectives of the emergency pan are to: 
                  •  Foster a jurisdiction-wide systematic approach to planning. 
                  •  Support a capability for prompt, coordinated response to large-scale disasters or threats simultaneously at all levels of government. 
                  •  Provide a basis for assured continuity of government. 
                  •  Promote uniformity in principles, policies and concepts of operations and compatibility of organizations and systems to facilitate coordinated response. 
                  This plan, and other plans incorporated by reference, include those objectives as well as defining the relationship between it and response management. If emergency managers define emergency response as a series of decisions, the emergency plan can be viewed as a framework for decision-making. It structures the options from which a decision maker can choose. In other words, a plan composed of decisions made during "normal" times to help guide decisions during a disaster. 
                  The emergency plan is linked to the response phase in two (2) important ways. First, during the planning process, the major agent-generated and response-generated demands are identified and strategies are developed for meeting them. The plan itself documents the strategies. Then, in the response phase, the strategies are evaluated and implemented. The second connection between planning and response management is exercises. Such activities should be mandated in the local emergency operations plan and viewed as part of the emergency planning process. 
                  (Res. No. 2008-3, 1-8-08) 
                  Sec. 18-57. - Emergency operations center(s). 
                  (a)  Responsibilities; structure; communication; location. As a place, the EOC differs greatly from one organization to another, but the functions are much less variable. As and entity, the EOC is responsible not only for assembling and directing local government response, but also for communicating with all other levels of government, with the private sector, and the public (both the public at large and the public at risk). 
                  The EOC is structured to fulfill an organization standard that includes the functions of management, finance and administration, logistics, operations and planning and intelligence. Although each of the functions is necessary, coordination, communications and intelligence are critical. Communications is viewed as central, with coordination running a close second. 
                  Communications issues are important to the emergency response capability. These issues include channel capacity, the importance of multiple channels, and the planning for a viable communications system. 
                  The location of the White County EOC is located on the bottom floor of the Mauney Building, 1241 Helen Hwy, Suite 150. In case of a major disaster, this location may be moved at the discretion of the emergency management director. 
                  Other rooms in the building will be identified as meeting rooms for section, branch and unit members, as required by the nature of the event. 
                  (b)  Alternate emergency operations centers. Alternate emergency operations centers for the county are listed by priority: 
                  (1)  White County Courthouse  59 South Main Street Ste A  Cleveland, Georgia 30528. 
                  (2)  Helen City Hall  25 Alpenrosen Strasse  Helen, Georgia 30545.

                  Sec. 18-58. - Preservation of vital records. 
                  The preservation of vital records is of high importance to the county. The preservation of vital records is critical to the county's recovery from a catastrophic event. In addition to the information retrieval requirements of response, each response function has a record-keeping component. Although the principal focus of vital records preservation is to support recovery through reimbursement of disaster-related costs, vital records also have a broader and arguably more important function. Vital records become vital because they help describe a reasonably complete compilation of damage, death, physical and mental trauma, and allocation of public and private resources, making it possible to learn from the disaster experience. 
                  Vital records for the county are maintained in several locations. A non-inclusive list includes the following:

                  Sec. 18-59. - Protection of critical infrastructure. 
                  During a disaster, public and private facilities will play varying roles in terms of importance. Their importance may be based on their day-to-day role and their expansion during an emergency, or upon unique circumstances common to the requirements of a particular emergency response. 
                  (1)  Definitions of critical infrastructures. The critical infrastructures addressed in this annex are as follows: 
                  a.  Telecommunications. The primary networks and systems that support the transmission and exchange of electronic communications among and between end-users (such as networked computers). 
                  b.  Electrical power. The generation stations, transmission and distribution networks that create and supply electricity to end-users so that they achieve and maintain nominal functionality, including the transportation and storage of fuel essential to that system. 
                  c.  Gas and oil production, storage, transportation. The holding facilities for natural gas, crude and refined petroleum, and petroleum-based fuels, the refining and processing facilities for these fuels and the pipelines, trucks and rail systems that transport these commodities from their source to systems that are dependent on gas and oil in one of their useful forms. 
                  d.  Banking and finance The retail and commercial organizations, investment institutions, and associated operational organizations, government operations and support entities that are involved in all manner of monetary transactions, including storage for saving purposes, investment for income purposes, exchange for payment purposes, and disbursement for loan purposes. 
                  e.  Transportation. The aviation, rail, highway, and aquatic vehicles, conduits and support systems by which people and goods are moved from a point of origin to a destination in order to support and complete matters of commerce, government operations, and personal affairs. 
                  f.  Water supply. The sources of water, reservoirs and holding facilities, aqueducts and other transport systems, the filtration and cleaning systems, the pipelines, the cooling systems and other delivery mechanisms that provide domestic and industrial applications, including systems for dealing with waste water and firefighting. 
                  g.  Public safety. The medical, police, fire and rescue systems and their personnel that are called upon when responding to a public health, safety or unusual incident where speed and efficiency are necessary. 
                  h.  Continuity of government. Those operations and services of government at federal, state, county and local levels critical to the function of the counties systems such as public health, safety and welfare. 
                  (2)  Alpha-designator (consequence index) system. In order to set in place some system for determining the importance of critical facilities, an alpha-designator system or "consequence index" has been developed. The alpha-designator system was developed to assist public safety agency ability to assess the importance of a critical facility. It will also provide a uniform system for prioritizing incidents collateral to a major catastrophic event. 

                   
                  (3)  Critical category groupings. In addition to the alpha-designator, facilities will be grouped into one of three categories that describe their criticality to county viability: 
                  a.  Category one. Damage to facilities or occupants will have a significant and immediate impact on White County's ability to effectively respond to or recover from a catastrophic event. These facilities have been identified by a public safety or public health agency as critical to public safety or health. 
                  b.  Category two. Includes facilities that, if damaged or destroyed, will have a significant impact within 24 hours upon the county's continuity of operations in business or the public interest. It generally should be an operation that is normally un-interruptible in nature. Alternatively, it could have regional, statewide or national impact that could severely affect economic, governmental or industrial operations. 
                  c.  Category three. Includes facilities that, if damaged or destroyed, can cause significant impact within 72 hours to the continuity of operations in business or other public interest.

                  "In cases where a county has an organization for emergency management, such organization shall include participation by each city within the county unless the governing authority of any particular city elects to implement its own organization for emergency management. Any two or more of the above-mentioned political subdivisions may, with the approval of the director, contract with each other so as to form one emergency management organization for the entire area included in the bounds of the contracting political subdivisions. The executive officer or governing body of the political subdivision is authorized to nominate a local director to the director of emergency management who shall have the authority to make the appointment." Upon appointment, the local emergency management agency director shall have direct responsibility for the organization, administration, and operations of the local organization for emergency management, subject to the direction and control of the executive officer or governing bodies and shall serve at the pleasure of such executive officer or governing body. The local director shall: 
                  • Maintain an emergency management office in a building owned or leased by the political subdivision and the director or designee shall be available or on call at all times beyond working hours; 
                  • Develop, in conjunction with public and private agencies/organizations that have responsibility for designated emergency support functions, plans for responding to and recovering from disasters and/or emergencies; 
                  • Respond to emergency scenes, command posts, and operation centers; 
                  • Coordinate emergency response of public and private agencies and organizations; 
                  • Attend training and meetings convened by the appointing authority or the (state emergency management) director; 
                  • Develop or cause to be developed, in collaboration with other public and private agencies within the state, mutual aid arrangements, consistent with state plans and programs, for reciprocal emergency management aid and assistance in case of emergency or disaster too great to be dealt with unassisted; and 
                  • Enter into mutual aid agreements, subject to approval of the governor, with emergency management agencies or organizations in other states for reciprocal emergency management aid and assistance in case of emergency or disaster too great to be dealt with unassisted (O.C.G.A. §§ 38-3-27 and 38-3-29).

                  Sec. 30-34. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation, and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections 30-34(b) and (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with the requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections 30-34(b) and (c) of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land-disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The local issuing authority may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in C.15, 16 and in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (5)  The local issuing authority may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections 30-34(c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq., for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia," published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 30-34(b)(2) of this article; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" mean a stream: That under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities; provided that they occur at an angle; as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent the local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections 30-34(b) and (c) of this article. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 2010-11, 5-3-10; Ord. No. 2016-21, 11-28-16, eff. 1-1-17)

                  (4)  In addition to the local permitting fees; fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5) provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (5)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the District, and any variances required by subsections 30-34(c)(15) and (16) and bonding, if required as per subsection 30-35(b)(7), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (6)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application.

If the applicant does not comply with this article or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 30-34(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices.

                  Editor's note— Res. No. 2002-44, adopted Sept. 27, 2002, did not specifically amend the Code. Hence, its inclusion herein as article IV, sections 30-121—30-126, was at the discretion of the editor. 

                  Sec. 30-121. - Purpose, statutory authorization, findings of fact and objectives. 
                  (a)  Statutory authorization. The state legislature has in O.C.G.A. Art. IX, § II, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the county board of commissioners does ordain as follows: 
                  (b)  Findings of fact. 
                  (1)  The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (2)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (c)  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters. 
                  (d)  Objectives. The objectives of this article are: 
                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  Sec. 30-122. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  Lands to which this article applies. This article shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the county. 
                  (b)  Basis for area of special flood hazard. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its flood insurance study (FIS), January 5, 2018, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, are adopted by reference and declared a part of this article. 
                  Areas of special flood hazard may also include those areas known to have flooded historically or defined through standard engineering analysis by governmental agencies or private parties but not yet incorporated in a FIS. 
                  (c)  Establishment of development permit. A development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this article prior to the commencement of any development activities. 
                  (d)  Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. 
                  (e)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing ordinance, resolution, easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this article and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
                  (f)  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this article all provisions shall be: 
                  (1)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
                  (2)  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
                  (3)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
                  (g)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the county, or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
                  (h)  Penalties for violation. Violation of the provisions of this article or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this article or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $1,000.00 or imprisoned for not more than 180 days, or both, and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the county from taking such other lawful actions as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces; 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters; 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
                  (b)  Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than two feet above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 30-124(a)(4), elevated buildings. 
                  (2)  Non-residential construction. New construction or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to two feet above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 30-123(c)(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available:

                  2.  In new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions; 
                  3.  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or 
                  4.  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; 
                  Where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than two feet above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than two feet above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement (refer to section 30-124(a)(6) above). 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  2.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of section 30-124(b)(3), above. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 30-122(b), are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if section 30-124(b)(4)a. above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of section 30-124. 
                  (c)  Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 30-122(b), where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 30-122(b), then the county building inspector shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of section 30-124. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2) and (3) shall apply: 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 25 feet, or stream buffer, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest immediate adjacent grade at the building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 30-124(a)(4), elevated buildings. 
                  The county building inspector shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (d)  Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). Areas of special flood hazard established in section 30-122(b), may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and non-residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest immediate adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 30-124(a)(4), elevated buildings. 
                  The county building inspector shall require a certification from a registered surveyor or registered professional engineer identifying the lowest floor elevation level and the record thereof shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a non-residential structure may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in Section 30-123(b)(1)c. and (b)(2). 
                  (3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure. 
                  (e)  Standards for subdivisions. 
                  (1)  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
                  (2)  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
                  (3)  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and 
                  (4)  Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and all other proposed development, including, but not limited to, manufactured home parks, commercial and residential subdivisions, and recreational vehicle parks, greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less.

                  (2)  In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. 
                  This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article.

                  Aquifer. Any stratum (rock layer) or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well. 
                  Drastic. The standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency document EPA-600/287-035. This methodology is the most widely used technique for evaluating pollution susceptibility. 
                  Groundwater recharge area. Synonymous with "aquifer recharge area." An area of the earth's surface where water infiltrates the ground, thereby replenishing the groundwater supplies within an aquifer. 
                  Pollution susceptibility. The relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections, and other human activities in the recharge area. 
                  Pollution susceptibility map(s). Maps prepared by the state department of natural resources (DNR) that show the relative susceptibility of groundwater to pollution. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas of high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential. 
                  Significant groundwater recharge areas. Areas mapped by DNR in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology (chemical nature and form of the rock), soil type an thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts, geologic structure, presence of "karst" topography (sinkholes, caves and fissures associated with limestone and other carbonate rocks), and potentiometric surfaces. Significant recharge areas in the county are those areas with thicker soils, as determined in the Piedmont and in the Blue Ridge of Georgia, where groundwater is stored in the overlying soils. Field mapping indicates that thick soils found in this area are characterized by a density of two or more geologic contacts per four square miles, (Source: 1976 1:5000,000 Geologic Map of Georgia), and slopes lower than 8%.

                  ARTICLE VII. - WETLANDS PROTECTION 

                  Sec. 30-181. - Title. 
                  This article shall be known as the "Wetlands Protection Resolution of White County." 
                  (Res. No. 2004-27, § I, 7-6-04) 
                  Sec. 30-182. - Wetland protection district. 
                  (a)  Wetland protection district. This article shall apply to all wetlands within the wetland protection district as defined herein and located within the jurisdiction of the county. The generalized wetland map, adopted as part of this article, shows the general location of wetlands and of the wetland protection district and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands before engaging in a regulated activity. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the county planning commission. 
                  (b)  Wetland protection district boundaries. The generalized wetland map is a general reference document and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a section 404 permit, as hereby described, will be required prior to any activity. No local permits or permission will be granted for a proposed development project that appears to contain wetlands or be located near wetlands so as to potentially alter them until the Corps of Engineers has determined whether jurisdictional wetlands exist on the site. The generalized wetland map does not necessarily represent the exact boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the county and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.

                  Sec. 30-183. - Permitting. 
                  (a)  Local development permit requirements. No regulated activity will be allowed within the wetland protection district without written permission or permit from the county. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetland protection district boundary, as determined by the county planning director or their designee, using the generalized wetland map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' determination shall be required. If the Corps determines wetland are present, on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a section 404 permit or a letter of permission is issued 
                  (b)  Permissible uses (use as a right). The following uses shall be allowed as a right within the wetland protection district to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other resolution or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein. 
                  (1)  Operations conducted during normal forestry activities, including minor dredge and fill associated with road construction, harvesting, and reforestation practices provided they meet the performance standards and road construction best management practices required under section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
                  (2)  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, and other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit. 
                  (3)  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing. 
                  (4)  Forestry practicing applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission and as specified in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
                  (5)  The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practice approved by the state department of agriculture. 
                  (6)  The pasturing of livestock provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and that approved best management practices are followed. 
                  (7)  Education, scientific research, and nature trails. 
                  (8)  Temporary Emergency Permit. A temporary emergency permit can be issued by White County or its designee for the following reasons:

                  Sec. 30-252. - Average slope calculation. 
                  Slope is the amount of vertical change in elevation per unit of horizontal distance. For the purposes of determining whether the natural slope is 25 percent or more, the natural slope of a given property shall be calculated perpendicular to topographic contours from property line to property line. Slope calculations methods that are permitted include measuring the proximity of contour lines on a quadrangle map; using appropriate computer algorithms working on USGS Digital Elevation Models and GIS or other software; or by a licensed professional experienced in measuring or calculating slope. For the construction of single family residences, property owners may submit an alternative method of slope calculation for consideration. These methods may include, but are not limited to, weighted average, slope mapping, or other field-based techniques. In such cases, a certified determination by a licensed professional will be accepted as final determination. 
                  A contour map is the essential tool in determining the average slope of a parcel, and shall be required with each application for preliminary plat approval. Contour information shall be included in the preliminary site plan or plat. When used, a contour map can supply all the necessary information to calculate slope using the following formula for average slope provided below. 
                  S = 0.0023 × I × L      A 
                  .0023 = Conversion faction (converts from square feet to acres) 
                  I = Contour intervals (distance between adjacent contour lines) 
                  L = Contour length (total length of contour lines within parcel) 
                  A = Acres in parcel

                  Where there is a drastic variation in the landform character within one site, the site may be divided into several distinct areas for the purposes of slope determination. This division must be approved by the community development director or designee. Generally, this provision shall only be used in cases where large tracts of property encompass flat land as well as significant mountain and hillside terrain. Details for each division calculation must be provided.

                  Sec. 30-254. - Land disturbance areas and impervious surface limits. 
                  Except for lots of record existing as of November 29, 2005 as provided in section 30-225 of this article, land-disturbing activity is limited to specific areas within a parcel not to exceed amounts as shown in Table 1. This area does not include setbacks, buffers, easements, etc. There must be an adequate amount of buildable land for proposed structure(s) and all land disturbing activities (i.e., roadways, driveways, septic/sewage areas, public structures, etc.). Once the buildable area is determined, the location of the development is left to the landowner, subject to compliance with all other adopted regulations. 
                  Except for lots of record existing on November 29, 2005 as provided in Section 30-225 of this Article, the total impervious surface resulting from development on any individual lot shall not exceed the amounts shown in Table 1. Alternatives to paving on individual residential lots are encouraged.

                  Sec. 30-255. - Limited disturbance areas. 
                  No development or land disturbance activity may occur in the following areas of a parcel. These areas may be included in the area used to calculate compliance with the minimum standards shown in table 1: 
                  (1)  Rock outcroppings; 
                  (2)  Wetlands or buffer areas along streams; 
                  (3)  Natural drainage ways; 
                  (4)  All sensitive natural areas; 
                  (5)  Significant historical and archeological resource areas as defined by the National Register of Historic Places or other federal and state agencies. 
                  The provisions of this section shall not apply to the crossing of streams and creeks for utility corridors and roadways if construction does not exceed 1,000 square feet, does not reduce drainage, and meets all other criteria for land disturbance activities as set forth in the county soil and erosion resolution, as amended.

                  Sec. 30-256. - Water system requirements. 
                  Where one or more wells are to be used for individual water supply, the proposed land disturbing activity and connection of building or structure to the water system shall meet all applicable requirements of the Georgia Water Well Standards Act of 1985, as amended; the requirements of the rules and regulations of the department of human resources regarding individual or nonpublic wells, and any more stringent requirements that may be imposed by regulation of the board of commissioners. 
                  If a public system is to be provided, the water supply system must meet all applicable requirements of the "Georgia Safe Drinking Water Act of 1977," as amended, and any other regulations that may be imposed by the state or the county board of commissioners.

                  Sec. 30-258. - Minimum lot size and lot width. 
                  This section shall apply only to lots created after November 29, 2005, the effective date of the original resolution adopting mountain and hillside protection. Slope-density regulations correlate intensity of development to the steepness of terrain in order to minimize damage from grading and removal of vegetation and land instability. In order to assure that the natural function of the land, density on steeper slopes must be lower than on flatter terrain. The maximum number of lots that maybe permitted to be subdivided from any tract depends on the average slope and the minimum lot size and minimum lot width requirements as specified in this section. 
                  Except as provided in section 30-259 of this code, no lot that is subject to the requirements of this article shall be approved for subdivision unless it complies with the requirements of table 1.

                  Sec. 30-259. - Reduction of minimum lot sizes and lot widths. 
                  This section shall apply only to lots created after November 29, 2005, the effective date of the original resolution adopting mountain and hillside protection. Cluster development may ease the need for services and take advantage of the best orientation for dwellings and other buildings, thus the rural character can be maintained through preservation of woodland and greenways. Such development can reduce the need of infrastructure and associated development costs can be lowered. Lots created after November 29, 2005 shall meet the requirements of section 30-258 of this code, except as follows: 
                  (1)  At the time of preliminary plat approval, an applicant may request and the county may grant approval of a subdivision for residential development that clusters the lots and residential development in a specific area of the tract, with the balance of land in that tract being designated as permanent green space. Lots within that cluster area may have a reduced lot width provided that no lot shall have a width, at the building site, of less than 100 feet. 
                  (2)  Lots within the clustered area may be reduced to the lot size minimum allowed by other regulations the county health department based on the availability of public water or sewer or approved private sewer systems.

                  Sec. 30-260. - Permitted size of construction area. 
                  In order to protect the natural character of mountains and hillsides, the land, in amounts as shown in table 1, must be maintained in a natural state. The total impervious surface resulting from development must not exceed the amounts shown in table 1. Alternatives to paving on individual residential lots are encouraged. This does not include the necessity of cutting of diseased trees due to infestation or areas under forestry or agricultural use. These areas must be included on the site plan.

                  Sec. 30-261. - Storm drainage. 
                  The potential for rapid erosion is extremely high in mountainous and hillside areas. Steep slopes create perfect conditions for rapid movement of soils downhill during rainfall. Therefore it is essential to address storm water drainage and soil and erosion before land disturbing activities begin. Natural drainage flows should be maintained wherever possible and developers and landowners are encouraged to use the best technology available to reduce the effects of this increased flow. All applications that affect the natural flow of storm water must meet all local regulations. This will include, but may not be limited to, the erosion and sediment control resolution. Stormwater flow shall not be altered from its natural flow so as to impact or damage the property of others.

                  Sec. 30-262. - Clearing and grading. 
                  A great deal of environmental damage associated with new development can be avoided if construction and the position of the development site are well planned. As the most potentially destructive part of the construction process, grading must be carefully planned and executed to maintain the stability of protected mountain and hillside property. The choice of an appropriate building site is the key to minimizing potential erosion problems. Grading, if required on the site, shall not take place prior to site plan approval and issuance of any permit required by the county soil erosion and sedimentation control resolution. Only areas which have been approved for disturbance may be disturbed, and then only after all erosion measures and other regulations have been met. 
                  The applicant's plans for meeting the following standards will be reviewed during planning or before construction begins: 
                  (1)  Cut and fill activities may be minimized by carefully selecting the site for structures, drainfields, septic tanks, etc. 
                  (2)  Grading areas should be clearly marked before any grading begins. Highly visible fencing is recommended to prohibit earthmoving equipment from moving beyond designated grading boundaries. 
                  (3)  Cut slope and fill slopes of steeper than 2:1 slope ratio will only be considered if shown to provide for more effective environmental protection while still being permanently stabilized with rock or other approved stabilization method. Alternative measures such as retaining walls of limited height may be used. 
                  (4)  Grading should be phased so that prompt re-vegetation will provide optimal erosion controls. 
                  (5)  All top and bottom edges of slopes caused by either cut or fill should be a minimum of two feet away from property lines.

                  Sec. 30-263. - Public roads. 
                  All roads that are intended for public maintenance must comply with county subdivision regulations and any other applicable regulations including but not limited to those for soil erosion and sediment control. Design and construction of such roads must be approved by the public works director. Variances to road requirements must be separately approved by the board of commissioners but an approval may be given if the result would provide stronger environmental protection while still maintaining public safety concerns.

                  Sec. 30-264. - Private roads. 
                  All private roads must comply with the county subdivision regulations and any other applicable regulations including but not limited to those for soil erosion and sediment control. Roads not intended for public maintenance must be designed and constructed to the standards in table 2, and approved by the public works director. Where private roads are proposed as extensions of existing public roads, the developer must clearly justify why existing public roads should not be extended for public use. Where private road designs are used for approvable of a subdivision, the following special notation shall be placed on the final plat, in bold type: 
                  "Roads within this subdivision are designated private, and will not be accepted for maintenance by the county unless owner(s) of the right of way meets the standard for public roads at the time of application." 
                  For the purposes of this regulation, the following road classifications will apply to this section: 
                  (1)  Private residential collector is a road or section of a road which: 
                  a.  Provides direct or indirect access from the entrance of the subdivision inward to 20 or more proposed residential lots and is designed to be the main travel path for residential access; 
                  b.  Is designed to serve, or has the potential to serve in a future phase, property in the same ownership as the applicant, and, if developed will meet the 20 dwelling-unit standard; 
                  c.  Connects proposed development with existing developments when the aggregate sum of residential lots in both developments meets the 20 dwelling unit standard; 
                  d.  Serves a nonresidential facility located within a resident development, such as recreation areas, club house, golf course, public utility sites, etc. 
                  (2)  Private residential subdivision road is a road or group of roads which: 
                  a.  Abuts less than 20 residential lots; 
                  b.  Serves less than 20 existing lots or proposed residential dwelling units; 
                  c.  Does not connect thoroughfares. 
                  (3)  Private shared roadway is a road or group of roads which: 
                  a.  Abuts no more than five residential lots 
                  b.  Serves no more than five existing or proposed residential dwelling units 
                  c.  Does not connect thoroughfares.

                  1 Alternative cul-de-sacs may be approved to minimize clearing and grading in protected mountain areas. The alternative cul-de-sac can be T's or other designs as long as they meet accepted design standards and address public safety concerns. 
                  2 In cases where the existing cross slope is 20 percent or greater, 1.5 to 1 cut and fill slopes shall be permitted provided that the developer guarantees that the slope will be adequately stabilized. 
                  3 In cases where the existing cross slope is 25 percent or greater, 1 to 1 cut-and-fill slopes shall be permitted provided that the developer guarantees that the slope will be adequately stabilized. Other steep slope alternatives will be considered in protected mountain areas to minimize clearing and grading. Examples could be retaining walls, stabilization with rock or other engineered materials, etc., as long as they meet sound engineering design standards. 
                  4 Maximum cut and fill slopes may be required to be flatter if required by site specific conditions for stability. 
                  The minimum turning radius of a cul-de-sac on a private shared residential road shall be 35 feet. Alterative cul-de-sacs may be acceptable if designed within the requirements of the Georgia State Amendments to the International Fire Code, appendix D, fire apparatus access roads; figure D103.1, dead-end fire apparatus access road turnaround.

                  Sec. 30-265. - Retaining walls. 
                  Retaining walls, where required, are recommended not to exceed ten feet in height and should be built to follow the contours of the land. Where greater total height is needed, two retaining walls should be considered with vegetation between them. Vegetation should be planted to screen large retaining walls from view.

                  Setbacks will be used to protect natural features of the mountain and hillside terrain. The following minimum setbacks shall be maintained unless otherwise determined by site plan review: 
                  (1)  Placing structures away from the shoulder reduces the visual impact of development as well as erosion on steep slopes. All structures must be setback a minimum of 20 feet from the shoulder of a ridgeline. The shoulder is defined as the plane at which the slope of the land changes from greater than 25 percent to a ridge top of less than 25 percent. See Figure 1. Natural vegetation must be maintained undisturbed within the setback area except for access to a lot or limited cutting to provide a view. All other setbacks including, but not limited to, those from streams, creeks, springheads and property lines must be met as required by the County Code.

                  Editor's note— Res. No. 2006-49, adopted December 5, 2006, amended the Code by repealing former § 30-268 in its entirety. Former § 30-268 pertained to cluster development, and derived from Res. No. 2005-32, adopted November 29, 2005. 
                  Sec. 30-269. - Restrictions. 
                  The following applications are prohibited on lands subject to the requirements of this article: 
                  (1)  Handling areas for receiving and storage of hazardous waste and solid waste disposal facilities are prohibited. 
                  (2)  Mining activities are prohibited unless previously permitted by the department of natural resources. 
                  (3)  Cell towers are prohibited in the protected areas except where the design and structure thereof blend in with the surroundings and are camouflaged.

                  DIVISION 7. - DESIGN REQUIREMENTS 

                  Sec. 30-281. - Purpose. 
                  Design regulations are not designed to prevent creativity or mandate a particular style of dwelling. Rather, they are essential to the goal of reducing visual impacts of development while ensuring the stability of the protected mountain and hillside regions. 
                  (Res. No. 2005-32, 11-29-05) 
                  Sec. 30-282. - Building heights. 
                  No building is permitted to exceed 40 feet from the natural grade of the land, as measured perpendicular from the highest point on the structure to the point of natural grade on the ground. Chimneys and power poles are not included in the height calculations. At no time shall a building extend above the existing tree canopy. 
                  (Res. No. 2005-32, 11-29-05; Res. No. 2006-49, 12-5-06) 
                  Sec. 30-283. - Outdoor lighting. 
                  While lighting outside of homes is often necessary, it can be quite obtrusive in the night skyline. Mountainous and hillside areas are generally rural in character and should be maintained as such even in the presence of development. The following guidelines shall be adhered to when placing outside lights: 
                  (1)  All lights shall have shielded fixtures that direct the light downward. These shields shall eliminate scattered light and excessive glare. 
                  (2)  Light poles shall not exceed the height of surrounding buildings. 
                  (Res. No. 2005-32, 11-29-05) 
                  Sec. 30-284. - Landscaping. 
                  Because the mountainous and hillside areas of the county are largely valued for their natural beauty, it is the intention of these regulations to preserve this forested quality. Any new development will create areas that will temporarily be deforested and/or unsightly. 
                  (1)  No construction equipment or development is permitted in areas outside those designated and approved for land disturbance. Such areas outside those portions of the lot designated and approved for land disturbance shall be left in their natural state. A natural state is defined as the condition prior to development or other human activity. 
                  (2)  Re-vegetation is required on all disturbed areas that remain after construction, including areas around permanent structures, resurfaced areas such as driveways and areas of cuts and fills, pursuant to land disturbance regulations. Where trees have been removed due to insect damage or disease, and this tree removal increases the land disturbance percentage in amounts that exceed amounts specified in Table 1, replanting is required. 
                  (3)  All stream buffers are to be maintained in a natural state pursuant to county soil and erosion regulations and state water quality control rules. 
                  (4)  Color choices that are considered to blend in with the surroundings of the site shall be considered natural in color and will require minimum replanting of vegetation for screening purposes. Color choices that stand out against the natural colors of the surrounding area will be considered intrusive and will require screening with natural vegetation that will minimize the effect on the surrounding area. The amount of screening required will be reviewed and approved by the director of community development or designee but will in no way require screening of more than 50 percent of the structure as a whole. Planted vegetation must achieve the required screening percentage within two years of planting and must be done within six months of the main structure receiving a certificate of occupancy. 
                  (5)  Trees eight inches, or greater, in diameter that are cut for view will be done in a staggered fashion to eliminate the tunnel effect caused by clear cutting. Reducing clear cuttings reduce the potential for erosion, stormwater runoff and landscaping and grading costs. Keeping mature greenery is recommended wherever possible to provide immediate aesthetic, environmental, and potentially monetary value.

                  Sec. 30-343. - Variances. 
                  (a)  Administration by the community and economic development department. The community and economic development department has the responsibility for administration of this section. The request for variance is reviewable by the planning commission if the director of community and economic development determines that the request for variance meets the criteria. A variance cannot be considered if a violation of the county code has occurred. A variance shall be sought prior to the approval of plans or issuance of permits as required in the County Code. 
                  (b)  Purpose. The purpose of a variance is to provide relief when the strict application of the statutes, codes or policies imposes unusual practical difficulties or unnecessary physical hardships on the applicant. Practical difficulties and unnecessary hardships may result from the: 
                  (1)  Size, shape or dimensions of the site; or 
                  (2)  Locations of existing structures; or 
                  (3)  Geographic, topographic or other conditions on the site or in the immediate vicinity.

                  b.  The application of this chapter to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship; and 
                  c.  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the water quality of Turner Creek or the Chattahoochee River or impair the purposes and intent of this chapter; and 
                  d.  The special circumstances surrounding the request for a variance are not the result of acts by the applicant; and 
                  e.  The variance is not a request to permit a use of land, buildings or structures that are not permissible under other resolutions; and 
                  f.  The variance would not result in an increase of the impervious surface of the development beyond that prescribed in this chapter. 
                  (2)  Variances shall not be granted: 
                  a.  If the special circumstances on which the applicant relies are a result of the actions of the applicant, owner or previous owners; or 
                  b.  To allow the use of property in a manner or for a purpose not authorized by the statutes, codes or policies. 
                  (3)  If the county discovers a violation of this chapter constitutes a violation of provisions of the Clean Water Act as amended, the county shall issue written notification of the violation to the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, U. S. Army Corps of Engineers landowner. 
                  (4)  The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers shall administer and review all variance requests to Article VII, Wetlands Protection. 
                  (5)  Any variance to road and street requirements must follow the standards and procedures of the county land subdivision resolution. 
                  (d)  Application requirements. The owner or duly authorized agent shall file an application for variances with the community and economic development department on the prescribed form. A complete application shall consist of: 
                  (1)  Variance request form. 
                  (2)  Copy of code section from which the variance is being requested.

                  d.  A review fee of $100.00. 
                  (f)  Appeal to the board of commissioners. Decisions or actions of the planning commission are subject to an appeal to the board of commissioners. However, the planning commission's action or decision shall remain in full force and effect pending such appeal. 
                  (g)  If an applicant desires to appeal a decision or action of the planning commission, the applicant shall notify the board of commissioners in writing within ten days of the action or decision of the planning commission. Upon receipt of this notice, the board of commissioners shall establish a date and time to hear the appeal. The request shall include:

                  (2)  Guarantees and evidence shall be required that such conditions are and will continue to be in compliance. 
                  (i)  Compliance with conditions approval. Adherence to the approved plans and compliance with conditions imposed in the variance are required. Any departure from conditions of approval constitutes a violation of this chapter. 
                  (j)  Vested interest in approved variances. A valid variance supersedes conflicting provisions or amendments unless specifically provided by the provisions of this chapter or the conditions. 
                  (k)  Investigations and reports. The director of community and economic development shall make an investigation to provide necessary information to insure that the action on each application is consistent with the variance criteria. Any report of such investigation shall be included in the application file. 
                  (l)  Revocation. Variances shall become invalid if not exercised within one year of the date of approval or if there is a change in ownership not otherwise noted and approved at the time of the granting of the variance. 
                  (m)  Limitations on reapplication. The planning commission shall not hear denied applications for the same or substantially similar variance application until a period of six months has elapsed.

                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 38-1. - Funeral assistance for indigent residents. 
                  The White County Board of Commissioners wishes to establish policies and procedures for financial assistance for the decent interment or cremation of deceased indigent residents of White County. 
                  Now, therefore, the following policy and procedures are hereby adopted: 
                  (1)  Policy. When a resident of White County dies and the deceased, his family and immediate kindred are all indigent and unable to provide for the decent interment or cremation of the deceased, the board of commissioners shall make available from county funds a sum sufficient to provide a decent interment or cremation of the deceased indigent person or to reimburse such person (other than immediate family) as may have expended the cost thereof voluntarily, the exact amount thereof to be determined by the board of commissioners. 
                  In that this assistance is only provided to those who qualify as being indigent, meaning no other sources are available for a decent interment or cremation of the deceased and there may not be any contribution/additional funds to upgrade an indigent burial or cremation. 
                  The applicant for indigent burial or cremation is responsible for contacting the funeral home of choice, the funeral home will explain the burial or cremation available under indigent assistance. 
                  (2)  Application. An application for indigent burial or cremation at the county's expense must be made by a relative or representative of the deceased. The application must be complete with signatures of all next of kin attesting to their indigent status. 
                  In the event that next of kin cannot be located, a funeral home or convalescent home may make application for indigent burial or cremation to White County. 
                  Applications can be obtained from the county clerk. 
                  (3)  Determination of eligibility. The county clerk will review the application for completeness. Once the board of commissioners' office has a complete application on hand, the county clerk will evaluate the application in order to determine eligibility. 
                  The deceased person must have been a resident of White County at the time of death to be eligible for indigent burial at county expense under the provisions of this resolution. 
                  If the application is denied, the county clerk will send a letter stating this to the applicant and funeral home. 
                  (4)  Extent of assistance. If the deceased and immediate family is determined to be indigent, the county clerk will request an invoice from the funeral home and process the payment through the county finance department directly to the funeral home. The county will pay up to $800.00 for the decent interment or cremation of the deceased indigent person, but shall not exceed the lessor of the costs of interment or cremation in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 36-12-5 et seq. 
                  If the deceased person dies owning property and/or personal possessions, the property and/or personal possessions, including any life insurance, retirement income or annuities, shall first be applied to the cost of interment or cremation. Funds will be provided pursuant to this chapter in an amount such that, when the funds are added to the property and/or personal possessions owned by the deceased at the time of death, a total of $800.00 will be available for burial or cremation. 
                  (5)  Reimbursement to county. In the event a deceased person was determined to be eligible for indigent burial expenses at the time of death and it is later evident that the estate has funds that would categorize the deceased as ineligible for indigent burial funds, White County may file a claim against the estate and recoup the funds so expensed for indigent burial. 
                  The funeral director shall agree that he shall receive no funds whatsoever from any of the deceased's family, estate, friends, or other sources except those funds be applied to the cost of the interment or cremation and deducted from the amount provided by the county.

                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 46-1. - Authority. 
                  The county board of commissioners read and duly adopted "A Resolution to Establish a Personnel System." 
                  (Res. No. 2004-16, 5-4-04) 
                  Sec. 46-2. - Purpose. 
                  The rules and regulations are adopted to provide for the recruitment and development of the best available employee for each position in the service of the county. They provide for establishing orderly procedures for administering the personnel system in such a way as to be consistent with the following principles: 
                  (1)  Recruiting, selecting, and advancing employees based on their relative ability, knowledge and skills; 
                  (2)  Providing equitable and adequate compensation; 
                  (3)  Training employees to assure high quality performance; 
                  (4)  Retaining employees based on the adequacy of their performance, correcting inadequate performance, and separating employees whose inadequate performance cannot be corrected; 
                  (5)  Assuring fair treatment of applicants and employees in all aspects of personnel administration without regard to political affiliation, race, color, national origin, sex, religious creed, age, disability or other protected characteristic and with proper regard for their privacy and constitutional rights as citizens; and 
                  (6)  The state recognizes the doctrine of "employment at will" which means that in the absence of a written contract of employment for a defined duration, an employer may terminate an employee for good cause, bad cause or no cause at all, so long as it is not an illegal cause. 
                  The policies and procedures of the county are not intended to create a contract of employment. Nothing contained in any policy or work rule of the county shall constitute a contract of employment or a contract or agreement for a definite or specified term of employment. Nor does anything in any policy or work rule of the county alter the "at-will" employment relationship between the County and its employees. Nothing contained in any policy or work rule of the county shall limit or otherwise restrict the option of the county or its supervisory employees to terminate the employment relationship. Either party to the employment relationship may conclude such relationship at any time, with or without cause.

                  The responsibility and authority for the administration and enforcement of the rules and regulations are vested in the county manager and supervising elected officials.

                  The county is committed to providing a professional work environment that maintains employee equality, dignity and respect. In keeping with this commitment, the county strictly forbids discriminatory practices, including sexual harassment and other forms of harassment, as defined in this policy. Any harassment prohibited by this policy, whether verbal, physical or environmental, is unacceptable and will not be tolerated, whether it occurs in the workplace or at outside work sponsored activities. 
                  (1)  Harassment defined. 
                  a.  The county prohibits any verbal, physical or visual conduct which could offend, intimidate or create a hostile working environment for any individual on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, gender, age, disability or any other characteristics protected by federal, state or local law. The county also specifically prohibits sexual harassment, which is defined in this policy as sexual advances, requests for sexual favors or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. 
                  b.  The conduct prohibited by the preceding paragraph will not be tolerated under any circumstances, including cases where the conduct is unwelcome, and/or: 
                  1.  Submission to the conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment; 
                  2.  Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting the individual; 
                  3.  The conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with the individual's performance or of creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment. 
                  c.  Types of behaviors that may constitute prohibited harassment include, but are not limited to: 
                  1.  Derogatory, vulgar, or graphic written or oral statements or jokes regarding race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, gender, sexuality, sexual experience or any other characteristics protected by federal, state or local law; 
                  2.  Unnecessary touching or physical assault; 
                  3.  Sexual compliments, flirtations, advances, propositions, innuendoes, suggestions or jokes; or

                  (2)  Scope. This policy applies to all employees, managers, supervisors and other staff, whether related to conduct engaged in by fellow employees, supervisors, or to someone who is not directly employed by the county, such as a vendor, consultant, client, customer, or other contact. 
                  (3)  Responsibility. 
                  a.  It shall be the joint responsibility of supervisors, department managers and the director of human resources to ensure adherence to this policy. 
                  b.  All elected officials, supervisors, department managers and the director of human resources have the duty of ensuring that no individual or employee is subjected to sexual harassment or any other form of unlawful harassment, and of maintaining a workplace free of such harassment. Elected officials, supervisors and department managers shall discuss this policy with employees and assure them that they are not required to endure any form of unlawful harassment. 
                  (4)  Complaint procedure. The county encourages employees to report all perceived incidents of harassment regardless of the position of the alleged offender. Any employee who has a harassment complaint against a supervisor, coworker, visitor, customer or other person, shall bring the problem to the attention of their supervisor, supervising elected official, or department manager. If the situation is not corrected, or if the complaint is of a nature that the employee would be uncomfortable in bringing it before the supervisor, supervising elected official or department manager, the employee may bring the complaint to the director of human resources or county manager. 
                  a.  If you believe that you have been harassed, you should immediately report the incident as set out above. If you are uncomfortable with reporting the harassment to these individuals or if you believe that your complaint was not properly addressed, you should report the incident to the chairman of the board of commissioners. 
                  b.  The complaint will be thoroughly investigated in a professional manner. The employee shall be notified of a decision or the status of the investigation as soon as possible. Even if the investigation produces insufficient evidence to support the complaint, there shall be no discrimination or retaliation against any employee filing a good-faith harassment complaint. 
                  c.  There shall be no discrimination or retaliation against an employee, who participates in the investigation of a harassment complaint. If the investigation substantiates the complaint, appropriated corrective and/or disciplinary action up to and including discharge will be pursued. Disciplinary action will also be taken against individuals who make false or frivolous accusations, such as those made maliciously or recklessly. 
                  d.  Actions taken internally to investigate and resolve harassment complaints shall be conducted confidentially to the extent practicable, appropriate, and consistent with the Georgia Open Records Act in order to protect the privacy of persons involved. 
                  (4)  General provisions. 
                  a.  If a harassment complaint is directed against the director of human resources, county manager or elected official, the functions assigned to those people by these procedures will be transferred to the county board of commissioners. 
                  b.  Retaliatory action of any kind taken because of an employee seeking redress under these procedures is prohibited, and shall be regarded as a separate and distinct cause for complaint and discipline under these procedures.

                  Sec. 46-35. - Information technology acceptable use policy. 
                  This section constitutes the policy for all county employees regarding the access, use, security and monitoring of the county's computer systems, network, e-mail and internet access. 
                  The primary purpose for the county network and all county information technology resources is to support and facilitate the business of the county as defined by the county commissioners and the county manager. Use of these resources for other purposes must be approved by the county commissioners, county manager and I.T. department prior to that use. 
                  The information technology resources of the county shall not be used for any activity that violates federal, state or local laws or any other applicable policy or statute. Specifically, but not meant as a comprehensive list, the county network will not be used to transmit offensive materials, hate mail, discriminatory remarks, obtain or transmit pornographic materials, communicate racial or ethnic slurs or anything that may be construed as harassment of others based on their race, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, disability or religious or political beliefs. Further, the county network shall not be used for commercial or profit enterprises, lobbying, advertising, religious material, political causes, outside organizations, or other non-government related solicitations. 
                  All users will be given a user account for access to the county network. User accounts will be protected by passwords to prevent unauthorized use. User accounts are to be used only by the authorized owner of the account and only for authorized purposes. Users will not permit the use of their account by anyone else. Any attempt to gain another individual's password, use another person's account or to circumvent password or other security measures is a violation of this policy. 
                  No user shall perform any action that disrupts or denies another user's access to the county network or other information technology resources. Heavy usage or high-demand activities that disrupt or significantly reduce the overall performance of the network should be avoided and may be restricted or rescheduled in order to maintain acceptable internet/network response times throughout the system. 
                  All data, information and files accessible via the county network are considered to be the private property of the county and shall not be disclosed except for legitimate county purposes consistent with this and any other applicable policy. Except in the course of genuine county business, users shall not damage, destroy, modify or copy information, files, data or passwords available on or via the county network. 
                  Illegal use of copyrighted software is prohibited on any and all systems in the county network. 
                  Network services, internet access and email services may be provided to county employees. The primary purpose of these accounts and services is to support and facilitate the business of the county as defined by the county commissioners and the county manager. Incidental personal use of these systems may occur, but such usage must not interfere with efficient and timely completion of county business activities or negatively impact the performance of the network. No user should attempt to gain access to another user's personal files or emails without prior, expressed consent from that user. The county may terminate the availability of the internet or email services at any time in its sole discretion. 
                  In no event shall the county be liable to any user for any damages, whether direct, indirect, special or consequential arising out of the use of the internet, accuracy or correctness of data bases or information contained therein or related, directly or indirectly, to any failure or delay of the county in providing access to the internet or email. 
                  All computers, communication, activity and all information stored, received or transmitted using the county network shall be assumed to be the property of the county and are to be used primarily for job-related purposes. Any email messages sent or received using the county network are considered property of the county. 
                  To ensure proper use of the network and computer resources, the county may monitor the use of these systems, information and equipment at any time. All users understand that there is no right of privacy associated with the county's computer equipment. In this regard, the county has the right to monitor all activities and communications, retain records of all activities and communications and use this information in any manner permitted by law. 
                  Violators of this policy are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination from employment.

                  a.  Frequent travel required for county business.

                  (Res. No. 2009-34, §§ I—V, 11-2-09) 
                  Sec. 46-37. - Social media policy. 
                  (a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of this policy is to establish guidelines for employees and/or volunteers who engage in social media activity as defined herein. This policy is not intended to prohibit any employee's and/or volunteer's personal expression in general or through social media activity in particular; however, because such activity can adversely affect the efficiency and effectiveness of county operations, as well as undermine public trust and confidence, a certain amount of regulation is necessary and appropriate. This policy therefore attempts to strike a reasonable balance between the employees' and/or volunteers' interest in engaging in social media activity and the county's interest in preventing unnecessary disruption to or interference with its operations and relationship to the public it serves. 
                  (b)  Definitions. 
                  (1)  For purposes of this policy, the term "social media" is defined as the online technologies through which employees and/or volunteers and other individuals engage in "social media activity" as defined below. In most cases, the term refers to internet-based websites such as MySpaceandreg;, Facebookandreg;, Twitterandreg;, Linkedinandreg;, Google+andreg;, YouTubeandreg;, Tumblrandreg;, and Bloggerandreg;. Online social media technologies covered by this policy also include, but are not limited to, such applications as web logs/blogs, video logs/vlogs, message boards, podcasts, and wikis. 
                  (2)  For purposes of this policy, the term, "social media activity" is defined as the act of sharing information or otherwise communicating through social media, including, but not limited to, the posting, uploading, reviewing, downloading, and/or forwarding of text, audio recordings, video recordings, photographs/images, symbols, or hyperlinks. 
                  (c)  Scope of policy. 
                  (1)  This policy applies to all employees and/or volunteers of the county without regard to whether their social media activity is conducted in or outside the workplace, while on or off-duty, or anonymously or through the use of pseudonyms. 
                  (2)  This policy applies to all employees and/or volunteers of the county without regard to job title, position or rank; however, with the approval of the sheriff's office, and any other department or affiliated agency of the county having special or unique concerns pertaining to its employees and/or volunteers' social media activity may adopt and implement more restrictive SOP's or other internal rules narrowly designed to address such concerns. 
                  (d)  Prohibitions on social media activity. 
                  (1)  All employees and/or volunteers of the county should remain mindful that, as public servants, they are generally held to higher standards than the general public with regard to their on-duty and off-duty conduct, professionalism, and ethics. As a result, certain social media activity that may be tolerated or even acceptable in the private sector may nevertheless constitute a violation of this policy. 
                  (2)  Each employee and/or volunteer of the county who engages in social media activity must take personal responsibility for ensuring that such activity is consistent with all policies of the county, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to making false or misleading statements, promoting or endorsing violence or illegal activity, promoting or endorsing the abuse of alcohol or drugs, disparaging individuals or groups based on race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or other characteristics protected by law, or otherwise engaging in conduct unbecoming an employee and/or volunteer of the county, bringing discredit to the county, or interfering with or detrimental to the mission or function of the county. 
                  (3)  Employees and/or volunteers must refrain from engaging in any social media activity which disqualifies them from performing, or in any way reasonably calls into question their ability to objectively perform, any essential function of their jobs. Examples of such functions include, but are not limited to, testifying, making hiring or promotion decisions or recommendations, conducting performance evaluations, and determining eligibility for county programs. 
                  (4)  While any employee, at his/her discretion, may engage in social media activity with any other employee(s) consistent with the prohibitions, limitations and restrictions, and guidelines of this policy, no employee may be required or otherwise compelled to engage in such activity with another employee. 
                  (5)  No employee, whether for purposes of engaging in social media activity or otherwise, may disclose or otherwise reveal any privileged or confidential information of the county, any other current or former employee of the county, or any applicant for employment with the county. 
                  (e)  Limitations and restrictions on social media activity. 
                  (1)  Employees and/or volunteers are strongly discouraged from disclosing or otherwise revealing their status as employees and/or volunteers of the county through social media and, except as otherwise authorized in advance by the county manager or the supervising elected official, are strictly prohibited from directly or indirectly representing themselves to be speaking on behalf of the county. Similarly, in the absence of prior approval, employee's and/or volunteer's social media activity should not reveal or depict the county's adopted logos, seals, symbols, uniforms, patches, badges, or similar items identified with the county. 
                  (2)  Except as otherwise authorized in advance by the county manager or the supervising elected official, if an employee's and/or volunteer's status as an employee of the county is disclosed, revealed, or otherwise made apparent in connection with his/her social media activity, his/her social media activity must include a prominently displayed disclaimer to the effect that the activity reflects only the employee's and/or volunteer's personal views or opinions and not those of the county; provided, however, that no disclaimer will shield an employee from the imposition of appropriate corrective and/or disciplinary action for social media activity which otherwise violates this policy. Employees and/or volunteers should recognize that social media activity is generally more likely to violate this policy and other policies of the county if their status as county employees and/or volunteers is disclosed or revealed in connection therewith. 
                  (3)  Except as otherwise authorized in advance by the county manager or the supervising elected official, no employee may utilize county computers or equipment for purposes of engaging in social media activity. 
                  (4)  Except as otherwise authorized in advance by the county manager or the supervising elected official, no employee, whether for purposes of engaging in social media activity or otherwise, may post or upload any information, audio recordings, video recordings, photographs/images, etc. from county computers or equipment. 
                  (5)  To preserve the continuity of the county's message, ensure accuracy, and avoid unnecessary confusion in the community, except as otherwise authorized in advance by the county manager and/or the supervising elected official, employees and/or volunteers should refrain from engaging in any social media activity that purports or serves to announce or explain the details of county programs, projects, activities, initiatives, or events. 
                  (6)  Exceptions to the above-stated limitations and restrictions may be authorized by the county manager or the supervising elected official; provided, however, that any request for such an exception represents a promise by the employee and or volunteer that, if approved, the disclosure of information, photographs, audio, video, etc. via social media activity will be fully consistent with the letter and spirit of this and all other policies of the county, any internal SOP's or rules adopted by his/her department director, as well as any laws pertaining to copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, and privacy and reputational rights. 
                  (7)  The county reserves the right to require any employee and/or volunteer to remove immediately any posted or uploaded text, audio recordings, video recordings, photographs/images, etc. (even if previously approved) if such posted material constitutes a violation of this policy or other county policies. 
                  (f)  Application to other policies. All personnel policies of the county relating to employee and/or volunteer conduct apply equally to conduct that occurs through social media. This includes, but is not limited to, policies relating to discrimination, harassment, retaliation, workplace violence, conflicts of interest, and political activity. Any conflicts or inconsistencies between this policy and any one or more other policies shall be resolved by the county manager or the supervising elected official. 
                  (g)  No expectation of privacy in social media activity. 
                  (1)  County employees and/or volunteers should be aware that social media activity is not secure or private, even if active steps are taken to restrict access. Once information has been posted or exchanged via social media, it is generally trackable, traceable, and accessible indefinitely. For this reason, and consistent with the county's current Information Technology Use Policy, employees and/or volunteers should have no expectation of privacy in any social media activity conducted in the workplace and/or on-duty or in any social media activity which otherwise directly or indirectly relates to or affects the county, any of its departments, or its employees and/or volunteers. 
                  (2)  The county reserves the right to inspect or monitor any social media activity engaged in by its employees and/or volunteers using county owned computers or other electronic equipment or devices. In addition, employees and/or volunteers may be required to provide access to any social media websites or other applications in which they participate upon a determination by the county that there is reasonable suspicion to believe that such access will reveal evidence of a violation of this policy or any other county policy. 
                  (h)  Workplace and/or on-duty usage. Because it recognizes that social media is an emerging form of communication, the county permits employees and/or volunteers to engage in limited social media activity in the workplace and/or while on duty, similar to receiving a personal text message or a telephone call of limited duration. Employees and/or volunteers choosing to do so, however, are expected and required to use proper judgment and discretion, recognizing that even very brief periods of social media activity can collectively amount to significant periods of time. Supervisors are authorized to restrict or prohibit workplace/on-duty social media activity, as appropriate. 
                  (i)  Corrective and/or disciplinary action; other potential consequences. 
                  (1)  Employees and/or volunteers engaging in social media activity in violation of this policy will be held accountable, and corrective and/or disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, may be taken in accordance with the county's disciplinary policies procedures.

                  Sec. 46-151. - Philosophy. 
                  (a)  The supervising elected official or a department manager is responsible for the proper and efficient operation of his/her department and for enforcing all policies and regulations. It is the responsibility of all employees to observe the policies and regulations. 
                  (b)  Disciplinary action may be imposed upon an employee for conduct or actions, which interfere with or prevent the effective and efficient performance of a department's responsibilities. The purpose of such disciplinary action shall be to effect a correction of an employee's conduct rather than to be punitive. 
                  (c)  The type and severity of disciplinary action shall be related to the gravity of the offense, the employee's record of disciplinary action, length of service, and actions taken in similar cases both within the department and in other departments. Adverse action taken must be based on cause supported by sufficient evidence, be consistent with other such actions taken and be fair and equitable.

                  Sec. 46-152. - Authority for disciplinary action. 
                  The county manager, department manager or supervising elected official is authorized to apply such disciplinary measures as may be appropriate and necessary. In cases of reduction in pay, suspension, demotion and dismissal, the department manager or elected official shall consult the director of human resources or county manager. This requirement for consultation is not intended to relieve the department manager or elected official of responsibility or to preclude the immediate suspension of an employee when emergency or other circumstances make it impractical to obtain prior consultation. 
                  (Res. No. 2004-16, 5-4-04) 
                  Sec. 46-153. - Reasons for disciplinary action. 
                  Any of the following violations are sufficient grounds for disciplinary action ranging from oral reprimand to dismissal, depending on the seriousness of the offense and other circumstances related to the situation. These offenses are illustrative and are not all-inclusive.

                  Sec. 46-154. - Types of disciplinary action. 
                  Disciplinary action should only be taken to the extent necessary to correct a problem. Types of disciplinary action from the least severe to the most severe are: 
                  (1)  Oral reprimand; 
                  (2)  Written reprimand; 
                  (3)  Probation; 
                  (4)  Suspension; 
                  (5)  Reduction in pay; 
                  (6)  Demotion; and 
                  (7)  Dismissal. 
                  (Res. No. 2004-16, 5-4-04) 
                  Sec. 46-155. - Procedures for disciplinary action. 
                  (a)  Oral reprimand. 
                  (1)  Whenever grounds for disciplinary action exist and the supervisor determines that the incident, action or behavior of the employee is such that more severe disciplinary action is not immediately necessary, the supervisor should orally communicate to the employee the supervisor's observation of the problem and offer assistance in correcting the situation. 
                  (2)  When an oral reprimand is given, the supervisor should ensure that the employee's personnel file is documented to show date and nature of the reprimand. The employee should be advised that the reprimand will be documented in the personnel file and that he/she may submit comments for the file. 
                  (3)  Depending on the circumstances or seriousness of the offense, normally no more than two oral reprimands should be given to an employee for the same type of offense, after which a more severe type of disciplinary action should be taken. Whenever possible, however, sufficient time for improvement should be allowed before further and/or more severe action is taken. 
                  (b)  Written reprimand. 
                  (1)  When a supervisor determines that a written reprimand is appropriate and necessary, the reprimand shall be addressed to the employee and shall include: 
                  a.  The charge; 
                  b.  The specific behavior; 
                  c.  The dates of the behavior that support the charge; 
                  d.  The warning that continuance of this behavior will result in more severe disciplinary action; 
                  e.  An offer of assistance in correcting the behavior; and 
                  f.  Circumstances affecting the severity of the discipline. 
                  (2)  A signed copy of the reprimand shall be included in the employee's personnel file in the human resources office. The employee shall have the opportunity to submit written comments to be included in the file and request review by next level supervisor if any. 
                  (c)  Probation. The supervising elected official or the county manager has the authority to place an employee on probation for a period up to one hundred eighty (180) days. Such action shall be considered the equivalent of a final written warning. 
                  (d)  Suspensions. Personnel, who are suspended, with or without pay, will continue to be entitled to the health insurance coverage they were authorized under the county's group policy prior to the suspension, until such time as the suspension is resolved. 
                  (1)  Misdemeanor or felony. When an employee has been charged with a crime classified as a misdemeanor or felony, the supervising elected official or department manager shall: 
                  a.  Review the nature of the employee's offense; 
                  b.  Assess the impact of the crime on the ability of the employee to perform the duties of his/her position in a satisfactory manner; 
                  c.  Determine whether continued service would put the public in jeopardy; 
                  d.  Assess the impact upon the reputation and good name of the county; 
                  e.  Consult with the director of human resources regarding actions to be taken; and 
                  f.  If appropriate, suspend the employee until disposition of the charge or charges. If a suspension is granted under this section, the employee may be required to pay health and insurance payments. 
                  (2)  Disciplinary action. When a supervising elected official or department manager determines that suspension is an appropriate corrective action, an employee may be suspended for up to 30 workdays. Ordinarily, an initial suspension for a particular offense will not exceed three to five work days depending on the seriousness of the offense. A 30-day suspension would normally be imposed only for the most serious and flagrant of offenses or as the last in a series of progressively more severe suspensions. 
                  (3)  Written notice. 
                  a.  On or before the effective date of the suspension, the supervising elected official or department manager will provide the employee with a written statement setting forth: 
                  1.  The reasons for the suspension; 
                  2.  The effective date of the suspension; 
                  3.  The date the employee should return to work; 
                  4.  The warning that continuance of this behavior will result in more severe disciplinary action; 
                  5.  An offer of assistance in correcting the behavior; 
                  6.  Circumstances affecting the severity of the discipline; and 
                  7.  Advice on the right of appeal. 
                  b.  Except in the case of suspension with pay and emergency suspensions, the employee shall have an opportunity to present at least oral reasons why he/she should not be suspended, which shall be considered before determining whether a suspension shall be imposed. 
                  (4)  Types of suspension. 
                  a.  Suspension with pay. 
                  1.  Whenever there is reason to believe that an employee may have committed a serious violation or offense, but sufficient evidence is not yet available to make a proper evaluation and determination of the appropriate final action, the supervising elected official or department manager may suspend an employee for up to ten workdays pending investigation with pay. 
                  2.  In certain circumstances, the supervising elected official or department manager may determine that even though a suspension without pay may not be appropriate, it is nonetheless necessary to relieve the employee of duties and remove him/her from the work site. In such a case, a suspension with pay may be given the employee for up to five workdays. 
                  3.  The county manager or supervising elected official may authorize a suspension with pay for any period that may be deemed necessary. 
                  b.  Suspension without pay. The supervising elected official or department manager shall give their employee the opportunity to present at least oral reasons why he/she should not be suspended without pay before determining whether a suspension shall be imposed. A supervising elected official or county manager may suspend an employee without pay. 
                  c.  Emergency suspension. If an emergency exists which makes immediate suspension of an employee necessary before concurrence can be obtained; to preserve the health and safety of the employee or others; or to continue vital services to the public; or to continue a county function without serious disruption, a supervising elected official or a department manager may make such an immediate suspension. 
                  (5)  Restoration to active duty. At the end of the period of suspension, the employee shall be returned to active duty at his/her previous salary rate unless other disciplinary action affecting the position and/or salary has been taken. 
                  (e)  Reduction in pay. In the event that a reduction in pay is warranted, the employee will be given advanced notification of this pending action and given the opportunity to respond. When a supervising elected official or department manager has obtained the required concurrences and determines that an employee's performance or conduct is of such nature that it can best be corrected through a reduction of pay within grade, the employee shall be advised in writing of such action as follows: 
                  (1)  The reasons for such action; 
                  (2)  The extent of the reduction; 
                  (3)  The effective date; 
                  (4)  Previous warnings, counseling and attempts to correct the situation; and 
                  (5)  Advice on the right of appeal. 
                  (f)  Demotion. In the event that a demotion is warranted, the employee will be given advanced notification of the pending action and given the opportunity to respond. A supervising elected official or department manager may determine that demotion of an employee to a position in a lower pay grade is a proper action to correct a situation. In such a case, supervising elected official or the department manager shall furnish the employee with a statement of the reasons for such action and the effective date at least three (3) days before the proposed date of the action. The statement shall fully set forth: 
                  (1)  The reasons for the demotion; 
                  (2)  Previous warnings, counseling and attempts to correct the problem; 
                  (3)  Notification of the employee's right of appeal. 
                  (g)  Dismissal. 
                  (1)  When dismissal is warranted, the employee will be given advanced notification of this pending action and given the opportunity to respond. 
                  (2)  An employee may be dismissed when: 
                  a.  All reasonable attempts at corrective action have been ineffectual; 
                  b.  The seriousness of and the circumstances surrounding the offense leave dismissal as the only feasible alternative; 
                  c.  The employee is no longer able to perform one or more duties required by his/her position due to loss of required license, permit or certification. 
                  (3)  A dismissal shall be effective only after the supervising elected Official or department manager has consulted with the director of human resources and has presented the employee with the reasons for dismissal in writing specifically and fully stated. 
                  (4)  The supervising elected official or department manager shall notify the employee of the right to appeal.

                  Sec. 46-156. - Department manager disciplinary action. 
                  The county manager has the authority to reprimand dismiss, suspend, or demote a department manager, for cause, in accordance with the guidelines outlined in this section.

                  Sec. 46-171. - Philosophy. 
                  (a)  It is the responsibility of employees of the county to provide efficient and continuous service to the citizens of the county. The county recognizes that employee morale is an important factor in maintaining a high level of public service; and that the efficient and productive organization is measured in part by the employee's willingness to work cooperatively with other employees and with his/her supervisor. 
                  (b)  The primary purpose of these rules shall be to determine what is right rather than who is right. Free discussion between an employee and supervisor will lead to a better understanding by both parties as to policies, practices, and procedures, which affect all employees. This will tend to identify and reduce conditions, which may cause misunderstanding and grievances.

                  Sec. 46-172. - Complaint. 
                  (a)  A complaint is a statement of employee dissatisfaction about some action, exclusive of adverse actions, event or condition in the work environment, which is meaningful to the extent that the employee feels it is necessary to make it known to others. 
                  (b)  Any complaint should be made verbally to the immediate supervisor. The complaint shall be dealt with informally. The reply will normally be verbal. 
                  (Res. No. 2004-16, 5-4-04) 
                  Sec. 46-173. - Grievance. 
                  A grievance is a complaint that has not been resolved. A grievance is caused in most cases by the inability or unwillingness of individuals to adapt to one or more aspects of the work environment. The failure to adapt can be the fault of the employee or the supervisor or perhaps both. An awareness of the underlying cause of grievances and prompt resolution of these causes is mandatory for effective employee relations and efficient performance of an organization. A grievance procedure has been established to affect this purpose. 
                  (1)  General provisions. 
                  a.  All county employees have the right to use the grievance procedure without fear of reprisal, restraint, coercion or discrimination. Grievances shall be settled equitably, fairly and promptly. 
                  b.  If the grievant fails to submit his/her grievance to the next higher step within the prescribed time limits, it shall be assumed that the grievance has been satisfied. 
                  c.  Should a decision not be rendered within the prescribed time limits, the grievant may immediately appeal to the next step. 
                  d.  Nothing in the grievance procedure shall be construed to prevent discussions or meetings to clarify facts in the case or resolve the grievance. 
                  (2)  Non-grievable areas. 
                  a.  Issues, which are pending or have been concluded by other administrative or judicial procedures.

                  Sec. 46-194. - Compensatory time. 
                  Compensatory time off is limited to employees entitled to receive overtime compensation under section 7 of the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act (non-salaried). As a rule, compensation should be paid for all overtime worked at the rate of one and one-half times the regular pay rate. However, at the discretion of the supervising elected official or department manager, compensatory time may be granted for use later if the use of compensatory time does not disrupt workload or services. Notice shall be provided before working overtime if an employee will receive compensatory time in lieu of overtime. 
                  (1)  Compensatory time off shall be used before using vacation leave. Compensatory time is accrued on a one and one-half basis; i.e. for every overtime hour worked, one and one-half hours of compensatory time shall be earned. 
                  (2)  Employees shall not accumulate more than 40 hours of compensatory time. However, Appalachian Drug Task Force agents who are employees of the county shall not accumulate more than 100 hours of compensatory time. Any overtime worked in excess of these hours must be paid at the rate of one and one-half times the regular rate. 
                  (3)  Supervising elected officials or department managers will maintain complete records that will include the date compensatory time was earned, the reason for compensatory time and the date that compensatory time was used. Compensatory time earned and used by each employee is a responsibility of each supervising elected official or department manager. 
                  (4)  The board of commissioners realize that exempt employees must devote a great deal of time outside of the normal business hours in order to accomplish the business of the county, and to that end exempt employees will be allowed to take reasonable time off as he/she shall deem appropriate during said business hours. Abuse of this benefit will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.

                  (Res. No. 2004-16, 5-4-04; Res. No. 2014-09, 10-6-14; Res. No. 2015-05, 5-4-15) 
                  Sec. 46-199. - Paid time off policy. 
                  (a)  Policy. The county will provide for employees, paid time off (PTO) for rest and recreation, family and life needs, disability, illness and medical treatment. Paid time off may be used for vacation, personal illness, illness of an immediate family member, or other personal business. This is intended to help employees maintain the physical health and mental outlook on life and work that will benefit them in their work and relationships with the county. The amount of paid time off provided for this purpose will be based on employees' length of service with the county and will be considered an earned benefit. 
                  For all regular full-time employees, a "paid time off day" is defined by this policy as the number of hours in length of one work day in an employee's assigned shift (i.e., eight hours, 8.5 hours, ten hours, 12 hours or 24 hours). An employee on paid time off will be compensated at their regular hourly rate times the number of "paid time off hours" actually taken. 
                  (b)  Application. The policy applies to all regular full-time county employees. 
                  (c)  Provisions: 
                  (1)  Eligibility. All regular full-time employees shall accrue paid time off at the applicable rate for their length of service and normal work schedule. Employees are eligible for paid time off as accrued after successful completion of their six-month probation period. 
                  (2)  Paid time off accumulations: 
                  a.  Paid time off is accumulated for employees as follows: 

                   
                  * Fire protection personnel will accrue at proportional equivalents as listed in subsection (5) of this policy. 
                  b.  Unused paid time off may be carried over from one calendar year to the next with a maximum carryover of 240 hours. 
                  c.  At the end of each calendar year, any accrued/unused paid time off in excess [of] 240 hours will be rolled into a personal catastrophic leave bank account. 
                  d.  Part-time/temporary employees are not eligible to accrue paid time off unless accrued paid time off was a condition of employment prior to the adoption of this Code. Part-time/temporary employees are allowed to take time off, with approval of the supervising elected official/department head. This time off is without pay and requests for such leave should be made as soon as practicable. 
                  e.  Paid time off accrual for eligible employees begins upon employment. 
                  f.  Employees shall accrue paid time off while in pay status, including vacation, sick, jury duty, military leave, authorized holidays, and hazardous weather conditions. 
                  g.  Paid time off will be taken in units of whole hours with a one-hour minimum; however the supervising elected official/department head may set a higher minimum. 
                  h.  During the initial year of employment, following the completion of the six-month probationary period, employees may use accrued paid time off subject to this policy and departmental approval. 
                  i.  Following the initial year of employment, all employees are required to use a minimum of 40 hours of paid time off each calendar year. 
                  j.  Upon separation from employment for nondisciplinary reasons or retirement, all employees will be paid up to 240 hours of accrued/unused paid time off, provided they have completed one year of service and meet the requirement of subsection (3)f. below. 
                  k.  Employees may not work in any county department when on paid time off. 
                  l.  Employees are subject to recall from paid time off due to emergency situations. 
                  (3)  Use of paid time off. 
                  a.  To request and schedule paid time off, all employees shall complete a paid time off request form and submit it to their supervisor at least three days in advance of the date of the paid time off. Paid time off requests may be denied due to work demands. When it is not possible to notify the supervisor in advance (i.e., if the employee has to call in due to illness) the paid time off request form should be completed and approved as soon as the employee returns to work. Unless physically unable to do so, employees must personally contact their supervisor to report their injury, illness, or other reason for unplanned absence within one hour of the report time of their scheduled work shift. Failure to comply with the call-in policy will result in denial of the paid time off request. 
                  b.  Employees must keep their supervisor informed of their condition and anticipated date of return. A medical certification may be required for any period of absence consisting of: 
                  • Two or more consecutive days of unscheduled absence; 
                  • If absence for illness-related purposes occurs frequently or habitually; 
                  • If the supervisor has reason to believe the employee may be fraudulently using paid time off benefits; 
                  • In order to establish an employee's fitness to return to duty; or 
                  • When the supervisor has reasons to question the employee's physical ability to return to work and perform all duties without restriction or without risk of injury to his/herself or others. 
                  c.  If a holiday occurs during the period an employee is on approved paid time off and the employee receives holiday pay, the day shall not be charged as paid time off. 
                  d.  Following the first seven consecutive days out of work (which the county pays) due to a work related injury, employees may use their accrued/unused paid time off to supplement their worker's compensation benefits received due to a work-related injury. 
                  e.  Employees must use their accrued/unused paid time off prior to taking any unpaid leave - paid time off will run concurrently with leave under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). 
                  f.  Upon separation from employment for nondisciplinary reasons or retirement, all employees will be paid for accrued/unused paid time off up to a maximum of 240 hours. 
                  To receive accrued/unused paid time off, employees are required to submit a minimum of two weeks' notice and department heads are required to provide a minimum of four weeks' notice. 
                  (4)  Responsibility. 
                  a.  Supervisors shall respond to employee requests for paid time off in a timely manner and shall be as responsive as possible in approving requests taking into account the county's best interest and fairness to other employees. 
                  b.  The county manager shall approve paid time off requests for department heads. 
                  c.  Supervising elected officials/department heads may have internal policies supplemental to this policy in order to meet the operational needs of their respective departments. County department heads must submit copies of their departmental policies to the county manager for approval and to human resources for reference. 
                  (5)  Fire protection employees paid time off accumulations. Paid time off is accumulated for ten-hour shift/50-hour per week fire protection employees as follows: 

                   
                  a.  Unused paid time off may be carried over from one calendar year to the next with a maximum carryover of 260 hours. 
                  b.  At the end of each calendar year, any accrued/unused paid time off in excess [of] 260 hours will be rolled into a personal catastrophic leave bank account.

                  (a)  Purpose. To establish a catastrophic leave policy, the terms of the accrual and use thereof for regular full-time employees who have exhausted all paid time off and have a qualifying absence. 
                  (b)  Policy. It is the policy to grant catastrophic leave with pay to eligible regular full-time employees in accordance with the policy guidelines, with catastrophic leave being available to regular full-time employees who have a qualifying absence, who have exhausted all paid time off and who have accrued catastrophic leave. This policy also sets forth a provision for the donation of a limited amount of catastrophic leave to employees who have an absence, who have exhausted all paid time off and who have no accrued catastrophic leave. Probationary, part-time, temporary and seasonal workers are not eligible for catastrophic leave. 
                  (c)  Guidelines. 
                  (1)  Accrual of catastrophic leave. Employees who have paid time off balances in excess of 240 hours at the end of each calendar year will have the excess paid time off placed in his or her personal catastrophic leave account at the beginning of each new calendar year, in accordance with the paid time off policy, section 46-199.

                  (3)  Intermittent usage. Intermittent usage of catastrophic leave may be approved to allow employees to obtain treatments that can only be given during working hours, i.e., chemotherapy, dialysis, radiation, etc. The employee must be able to perform the essential functions of his or her position, must apply for and be approved for family medical leave or worker's compensation, before he or she will be allowed to use catastrophic leave on an intermittent basis. Requests for intermittent usage and documentation supporting the request must be submitted to the employee's immediate supervisor, supervising elected official/department head and human resources for review and approval. The information will be maintained in the employee confidential medical or worker's compensation file.

                  b.  The employee must provide a return to work statement from the attending physician indicating he/she is able to perform the essential functions of his or her position without restrictions or limitations. The statement must be presented to the immediate supervisor, supervising elected official/department head, and the human resources department prior to his or her return to work after a personal illness or injury. 
                  c.  No catastrophic leave will be granted to an eligible employee in excess of the amount accrued and available to such employee.

                  (e)  Department responsibility. It is the responsibility of each supervising elected official/department head or designated supervisor to ensure the provisions of this policy are observed. Corrective action should be taken in instances of suspected abuses or misinterpretation of the utilization of catastrophic leave. The supervising elected official/department manager will ensure that use of catastrophic leave is recorded on the employee time sheet. 
                  (f)  Leave forfeiture. Unused accrued catastrophic leave shall be forfeited upon termination of employment. 
                  (g)  Donation of catastrophic leave.

                  a.  Employees with a catastrophic leave balance in excess of 40 hours may donate up to one-half of their leave balance to another full-time, non-probationary employee in strict accordance with all conditions of this policy applying to the leave recipient. 
                  b.  The maximum number of hours which can be donated to one leave recipient in a 12-month period is 40 hours per employee and 480 hours cumulative. 
                  c.  All catastrophic leave donations must be coordinated through human resources and approved by the department head/county manager, or supervising elected official.

                  a.  Any donated catastrophic leave remaining to the credit of a leave recipient when the medical emergency terminates shall be restored as provided below, and to the extent administratively feasible, by transfer to the catastrophic leave accounts of leave donors who, on the date leave restoration is made, are employed by White County. 
                  b.  The amount of unused donated catastrophic leave will be restored to each donor at an amount proportionate to the number of hours donated, using the following formula: 
                  • Divide the number of hours of unused donated catastrophic leave by the total number of hours of catastrophic leave transferred to the leave recipient. 
                  • Multiply the ratio obtained by the number of hours of catastrophic leave transferred by each leave donor eligible for restoration. 
                  • Round the result obtained above to the nearest hour. (.5 will be rounded up.) 
                  • If the total number of eligible leave donors exceeds the total number of hours of leave to be restored; no unused transferred leave shall be restored. In no case shall the amount of leave restored to a leave donor exceed the amount transferred to the leave recipient by the leave donor. 
                  • If the leave donor retires, dies, or is otherwise separated from employment with White County before the date unused transferred leave can be restored, the county shall not restore the unused transferred leave to that donor. 
                  (3)  Prohibition of coercion. 
                  a.  An employee may not directly or indirectly intimidate, threaten, or coerce, or attempt to intimidate, interfering with any right such employee may have with respect to donating, receiving, or using catastrophic leave.

                  a.  Birth and/or care of a child of the employee;

                  d.  A serious health condition, which renders the employee unable to perform the functions of the employee's position. 
                  (2)  The 12-month period shall be a "rolling" 12-month period measured backward from the date an employee uses any FMLA leave will be used to determine the 12 weeks of eligibility. 
                  (b)  In the case of unpaid leave for the birth or placement of a child, intermittent leave or working a reduced number of hours is not permitted unless both the employee and employer agree. Likewise, in such event, if the county employs both spouses, the combined leave shall not exceed 12 weeks. Leave for birth or placement of a child must conclude within 12 months of the birth or placement. 
                  (c)  In the case of unpaid leave for serious health conditions, the leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced-hours basis only if such leave is medically necessary. If intermittent or reduced hours leave is required, the county may in its sole discretion temporarily transfer the employee to another job with equivalent pay and benefits. 
                  (d)  During family leaves of absence, the county will continue to pay the health insurance premiums of the employee on the same bases of current county pay.

                  (1)  The employee does not return because of the presence of a serious health condition which prevents the employee from performing his/her job; 
                  (2)  Circumstances beyond the control of the employee; or 
                  (3)  The employee is a "key" employee hereinafter defined and the county denied job restoration to the employee. 
                  (e)  To the extent allowed by law, employees are required to use their available vacation time and sick leave, if such leave is otherwise available to the employee in accordance with the sick leave policy, during the 12-week family leave. 
                  (f)  During unpaid leave, the employee shall not accrue employment benefits, such as vacation pay, sick pay, leave accrual, pension, etc. Employment benefits accrued by the employee up to the day on which the family leave of absence begins will not be lost. 
                  (g)  Employees who return to work from family leave of absence within or on the business day following the expiration of the 12 weeks are entitled to return to their job or an equivalent position without loss of benefits or pay. 
                  (h)  The county may, under specified and limited circumstances, refuse to reinstate certain, high-paid "key" employees after using family leave. In order to do so, the county will: 
                  (1)  Notify the employee of his/her status as "key" employee in response to the employee's notice of intent to take family leave. 
                  (2)  Notify the employee as soon as the county decides to deny job restoration and explain the reasons for this decision.

                  (i)  A "key" employee is a salaried "eligible" employee who has been designated by the county as "key." Normally, a "key" employee is among the highest paid ten percent of employees within 75 miles of the work site. 
                  (j)  Applications for family leaves of absence must be submitted at least 30 days before the leave is to commence, or as soon as possible if 30 days notice is not possible. Appropriate forms should be submitted through the department manager to the county manager to initiate family leave and to return the employee to active status. Employees requesting family leave shall provide the county with appropriate medical certification. 
                  (k)  Prior to return to active duty, a medical certificate of fitness for duty is required before being restored to employment. 
                  (l)  The provisions of this family leave policy shall supersede any conflicting personnel policies when the requested leave qualifies as leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act. 
                  (m)  Military family leave entitlements. 
                  (1)  Eligible employees with a spouse, son, daughter, or parent on active duty or call to active duty status in the National Guard or Reserves in support of a contingency operation may use their 12-week leave entitlement to address certain qualifying exigencies. Qualifying exigencies may include attending certain military events, arranging for alternative childcare, addressing certain financial and legal arrangements, attending certain counseling sessions, and attending post- deployment reintegration briefings. 
                  (2)  FMLA also includes a special leave entitlement that permits eligible employees to take up to 26 weeks of leave to care for a covered service member during a single 12-month period. A covered service member is a current member of the Armed Forces, including a member of the National Guard or Reserves, who has a serious injury or illness incurred in the line of duty on active duty that may render the service member medically unfit to perform his or her duties for which the service member is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy; or is in outpatient status; or is on the temporary disability retired list.

                  (b)  The leave will not be more than eight hours in each calendar year. This absence shall be computed at two hours per donation, up to four times per year.

                  In those instances where the nature or length of a leave, with the exception of military service and leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act, dictates that the county fills the employee's position on a permanent basis, the county reserves the right to refuse reemployment to the displaced employee to the extent allowed by law.

                  Sec. 46-211. - Bridging years of service. 
                  Any full-time employee, who terminates employment with the county and subsequently returns in a full-time capacity, may be allowed to "bridge" back to the original employment period. 
                  (1)  For retirement purposes: The following is descriptive only as an employee's right to retirement benefits, including the amount thereof, shall be governed by the applicable plan documents and shall not be in any way modified, supplemented, or enhanced by the following: 
                  a.  When an employee has been covered by the county's retirement plan during a period of employment, which measures five years, or longer, he/she shall retain a non-forfeitable right to his/her monthly accrued benefit (retirement pay) determined as of his date of termination of employment. However, should the employee elect, the employee may receive all participant contributions (plus interest) at the time of employment termination. When this occurs, and the employee subsequently returns to full-time employment, "bridging" back to the original employment period is not allowed. Conversely, if the employee elects to leave his/her contributions in the retirement plan at the time of termination of service, but subsequently returns to full-time employment, full credit will be given for the prior period in which participant contributions were made. 
                  (2)  For leave purposes: Bridging is not allowed back to the original employment date, but the anniversary date will be adjusted to give credit for prior service.

                  Sec. 46-214. - Employee assistance program policy. 
                  (a)  Purpose. To assist all county employees at a time when issues of a personal nature may interfere with their effective functioning as members of a competent staff, with a goal of improving or maintaining their job performance and retaining them as valued members of the county staff. 
                  (b)  Policy. 
                  (1)  It is the policy of the county to offer all employees the use of an employee assistance program to provide confidential assessment and referral service for serious personal problems. An independent organization will be selected to provide these services. 
                  (2)  The county recognizes that a number of personal/medical problems including, but not limited to: stress, legal, financial, alcoholism, marital and family concerns, drug dependence, emotional problems, etc., are treatable disorders and can improve with proper professional assistance. 
                  (3)  The benefits of the employee assistance program shall be available to all employees of the county and their dependents who seek assessment and referral for personal or medical problems. 
                  (4)  The services of the employee assistance program will be provided to employees at no cost. However, when referrals are made to resources outside of the employee assistance program, the employee will be responsible for the costs. 
                  (5)  All records of the employee assistance program shall be strictly confidential unless the employee chooses to sign a release. The purpose of this aspect of the policy is to encourage employees and their families to seek referral to treatment without embarrassment. 
                  (c)  Supervisory referrals. 
                  (1)  The county recognizes that supervisory personnel are not trained to be diagnosticians of personal or medical problems, yet they may be the first to notice a deterioration of job performance, which may indicate such problems. Therefore, supervisory referrals to the employee assistance program must be based strictly on documented deteriorating job performance. 
                  (2)  Such referrals for assessment for failure in performance of duties will be considered mandatory. Failure to comply with a mandatory referral will be addressed under the guidelines of the county's disciplinary policy. 
                  (3)  No employee shall have his or her job placed in jeopardy because of a request for assistance for a personal/medical problem. However, employees referred to the employee assistance program will be fully responsible for cooperating and participating in the program. 
                  (4)  Although the employee is expected to follow through on the recommendations of the employee assistance counselor, job performance remains the ultimate criteria for assessment. Continuing job performance decline will be handled according to normal disciplinary procedures. 
                  (5)  To ensure the successful implementation of this program, employee feedback is encouraged in order to adapt the program, if necessary, to better meet the needs of all county employees. 
                  (6)  This policy does not alter or replace existing administrative policy, but serves to assist in its utilization. 
                  (d)  Time off. If an employee requests time off from work to seek assistance, the employee will be granted time off in the following order: 
                  (1)  Compensatory time; 
                  (2)  Paid time off (PTO); 
                  (3)  Time off without pay. 
                  (e)  Voluntary disclosure of drug and/or alcohol abuse. Employees of the county shall be entitled to up to 30 consecutive calendar days for initial substance abuse treatment as follows: 
                  (1)  The employee shall be required to use all paid time off (PTO) and compensatory time available; 
                  (2)  In the event accumulated paid time off (PTO) and compensatory time is insufficient to provide the medically prescribed and needed treatment, up to a maximum of 30 consecutive calendar days, the employee will be provided paid leave for the difference up to the maximum 30-day treatment period.

                  APPENDIX A. - SUBSTANCE ABUSE/DRUG TESTING POLICY 
                  White County promotes a drug-free workplace in accordance with the requirements of the: 
                  •  Drug Free Workplace Act of 1988 - published by the Federal government, as amended, 49 CFR Part 29 - which requires the establishment of a drug free workplace policy and the reporting of certain drug related offenses to the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and 
                  •  The Federal Transit Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) as published in 49 CFR Part 653 and Part 654, as amended that mandates urine drug testing and breathe alcohol testing for safety sensitive positions and prohibits performance of safety sensitive functions when there is a positive test result. The DOT has published 49 CFR Part 40, as amended, which sets standards for the collection and testing of urine specimens. 
                  White County has adopted these requirements for the safety, health, and well being of all employees and those they come in contact with in their public service as employees of White County. Employees must report to work drug and alcohol free. 
                  Standard 
                  Drug and alcohol use by all county employees during assigned working hours, in government buildings, on government grounds, or otherwise while on government business is prohibited. This shall include the use of illegal substances, the abuse of prescription and over the counter medications, and the use of alcohol. The interpretation and administration of this policy shall be the responsibility of the county manager and human resources director. 
                  Scope 
                  This policy applies to all county employees; paid full or part time employees, contract employees, and contractors when they are on county property or when performing transit related safety sensitive business. This policy applies to off-site lunch periods or breaks when an employee is scheduled to return to work. Visitors, vendors and contractor employees are governed by this policy while on county premises and will not be permitted to conduct business if found in violation of this policy. 
                  In addition to employees, for the purposes of this policy, volunteers whose duties for the county involve safety sensitive functions shall be subject to testing as set forth within the policy statement. 
                  Definitions 
                  I.  Covered Substances - The following substances are covered by this policy:

This includes being impaired by lawfully prescribed drugs that have been abused; and, 
                  D.  Performing duties while under the influence of alcohol or controlled and/or illegal substances or drugs regardless of whether the employee is on or off county premises; 
                  1.  Off premises use of alcohol, controlled and/or illegal drugs, or substances is prohibited, to the extent that it involved, or results in: 
                  a.  Any actions involving alcohol, controlled and/or illegal drugs or lawfully prescribed drugs or substances that, in the opinion of management endanger the county's reputation of honesty, integrity, and safety. 
                  b.  Any employees who are on an "on call" work status must be able to respond to calls without being under the influence of drugs or alcohol. For the purpose of this policy, on call is a pre-defined specific period of time designated by an employee's supervisor whereby there is a high probability the employee may be called upon to report to active service. 
                  c.  Indictment or conviction for criminal; offenses related to the manufacture, possession, use, sale, distribution, dispensation, receipt, or transportation of any controlled substances or illegal drugs. 
                  d.  Employees who are indicted for, or convicted of, controlled substance related violations under state or federal law, or who plead guilty or nolo contendere (no contest) to such charges must inform their supervisor of human resources in writing within five (5) days of such conviction or plea. Failure to do so will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination from employment for a first offense. The supervisor shall then investigate and make an appropriate recommendation to the county manager. 
                  III.  Safety sensitive positions - Those positions or groups of positions in which employees regularly perform "high risk" or "safety sensitive" work where inattention to duty or errors in judgment while on duty have the potential for significant risk or harm to employee, other employees, vulnerable populations, or the general public. 
                  Procedure 
                  All county employees are subject to the provisions of this policy. 
                  I.  Current employees - Each current employee will be provided with a copy of this policy and the substance abuse acknowledgement form two weeks prior to the implementation of the policy. By signing this form, each employee acknowledges that he/she has received the policy, understands, and agrees to the provisions of this policy. If a current employee refuses to comply with the provisions of this policy, that employee will be terminated. All completed forms will be forwarded to human resources. 
                  II.  New employees - Each new employee shall, at the time of hire, be provided with a copy of the policy and the acknowledgement form. The new employee must read the policy and sign the form before being permitted to work. 
                  Compliance with testing requirements 
                  I.  Pre-employment drug and alcohol testing - All job applicants identified as final candidates for employment with the county shall sign a statement of understanding and consent for a pre-employment drug testing and shall submit to required drug testing procedures. 
                  A.  Failure to sign the consent release form or to submit to a drug screening will result in rejection of the applicant. 
                  B.  If the measurement of the presence of prohibited substances is less than the sensitivity levels established by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the candidate will have passed the screening procedures. 
                  1.  A Panel 10 drug screen is utilized, which detects controlled medications, as well as illegal substances. The presence of the following substances is tested: amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine metabolites, marijuana metabolites, methadone, methaqualone, opiates, phencyclidine, and propoxyphene. 
                  C.  If one or more of the measures equals or exceeds the sensitivity levels, then the candidate will not have passed the screening and will not be offered employment. 
                  D.  Job candidates rejected for consideration of employment due to the presence of controlled substances may reapply for employment following a 12-month waiting period. 
                  Random testing 
                  All employees of the county performing a safety sensitive duty, as outlined in exhibit A, will be subject to random, unannounced testing. The selection of employees of the random testing will be made using a scientifically valid method, which ensures that each employee will have an equal chance of being selected each time a selection is made. The random test will be unannounced and spread throughout the year. 
                  Employee assistance program 
                  If an employee notifies the county administrator of a drug dependency problem and agrees to attend an approved treatment program, that employee will not be terminated solely for the drug dependence or use for one year if the employee adheres to the treatment program. This option is available only one time during any five-year period. This policy does not prevent the restructuring of an employee's duties to take the drug dependence into account. 
                  Post accident testing 
                  Whenever an employee of the county has been involved in an accident or is injured - alcohol and drug testing shall be conducted. Drug testing within 32 hours and alcohol testing within eight hours of the accident when any of the following incidents occur: 
                  •  Vehicle/equipment damage or bodily injury occurs on public property, or 
                  •  There is a fatality, or 
                  •  Driver is cited with a traffic violation, or 
                  •  There is a reasonable suspicion to believe that an employee's behavior or appearance may indicate alcohol or drug use; or 
                  •  When an employee sustains a work related injury requiring medical treatment. 
                  Reasonable suspicion testing 
                  All employees may be subject to urine and/or alcohol testing when there are reasons to believe that drug or alcohol use is adversely affecting job performance. 
                  I.  A reasonable suspicion referral for testing will be made on the basis of the documented objective facts and circumstances that are consistent with the short term effects of substance abuse or alcohol misuse. Situations that may give rise to a conclusion that an employee is under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol include, but are not limited to the following: 
                  A.  An employee is involved in a physical or verbal altercation on the job. 
                  B.  An employee has an excessive number of incidents / accidents on the job. 
                  C.  An employee has a excessive number of absences. 
                  D.  An employee exhibits unusual behavior such as slurred speech or unsteady walking or movement, and / or change in behavior. 
                  E.  An employee has an odor of drugs or alcohol on their person while on the job. 
                  F.  An employee is in the possession of alcohol or drugs on the job. 
                  II.  Supervisors suspecting that an employee is under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol shall immediately report the incident to the human resources department. 
                  III.  The determination of whether reasonable suspicion exists shall be made by the supervisor or by the highest ranking supervisory staff on duty at the time. The facts underlying the determination of reasonable suspicion shall be disclosed to the employee at the time the submittal to a drug/alcohol test is required. 
                  IV.  Following the determination that reasonable suspicion exists, the employee's supervisor or designee shall transport the employee to and from the testing site. If an employee is found to be in violation of these regulations, following the testing procedure or if test results are not immediately available, the person transporting the employee shall make arrangements to transport the employee home. Employees who have been tested due to reasonable suspicion may not return to work until the test results are conclusively negative. Employees will be paid for this time, only if test results are concluded to be negative. 
                  V.  Supervisors shall be required to document in writing, within the next working day, the specific facts, symptoms or observations that formed the basis for his/her determination that reasonable suspicion existed to warrant the testing of an employee. All documents created in connection with the determination of reasonable suspicion shall be forwarded to the human resources department. 
                  Prescription drug use or over the counter medications 
                  An employee using prescription medication while on the job shall do so in strict accordance with medical directions. It is the employee's responsibility to notify the prescribing physician of the duties required by the employee's position and to ensure that the physician approves the use of the prescription medication while the employee is performing his/her duties. The employee shall be responsible for notifying his or her supervisor of any restrictions that may affect/prevent the safe performance of the required duties, including driving county vehicles. 
                  An employee or job applicant shall, at the time of testing, provide a list of those prescriptions and over-the counter medication that he/she has recently used. The list of medications shall be kept confidential until there has been a test result. The list of medications shall be disclosed only to the medical review officials who will determine whether the positive result was due to the lawful use of any of the medications disclosed by the employee. 
                  Testing procedures 
                  All testing procedures shall be administered and accounted for by an approved laboratory and/or medical facility that are operated in compliance with the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) Guidelines. 
                  I.  All NIDA urine drug testing specimens must be collected as "split" specimens, which means that one urine specimen will be divided into two separately sealed specimen bottles for submission to the laboratory. 
                  II.  Whenever an initial test is found to be positive, an automatic confirmation test will be preformed. If the result is positive, then that employee has 72 hours to request from the medical review officer that the split sample be sent to a second lab for testing. 
                  III.  If the second portion of the sample also tests positive, then the employee shall be terminated/denied employment. Notification of termination shall be by certified letter from the human resources department within two working days of the test result. If the second portion produces a negative result, or for any reason the second portion is not available, the test is considered negative and no sanctions shall be imposed. 
                  IV.  If the result of the evidential breath test (EBT) is 0.02 or greater, a confirmation test must be conducted within at least 15 minutes, but not more than 20 minutes, after the completion of the initial test. 
                  Confidentiality of Test Results 
                  All information from an employee's job applicants' drug and alcohol test shall be kept confidential and only available to management and the human resources department. Disclosures of test results to any other person, agency, or organization shall be prohibited unless written authorization is obtained from the employee, job applicant, or by a court ordered subpoena. The results of a positive drug screen or alcohol test shall not be released until the results are confirmed. 
                  Disciplinary and termination policy 
                  An employee found to be in violation of the substance abuse policy is engaged in misconduct. The employee will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate dismissal. 
                  I.  Immediate termination - The following reasons shall be grounds for immediate termination of an employee: 
                  A.  Distributing controlled substances while on the job. 
                  B.  Operating a county vehicle while under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol. 
                  C.  Felony conviction for violation of drug laws. 
                  D.  Testing positive for drugs or alcohol. 
                  E.  Refusal to submit to a drug test required by the provisions of this policy. 
                  F.  Failure to disclose a drug / alcohol problem. 
                  G.  Failure to participate in a random drug monitoring program.

                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 2009-12, adopted May 28, 2009, added new provisions which were designated as art. II; therefore the designation of sections 50-1—50-3 as art. I was added at the discretion of the editor. 

                  Sec. 50-1. - Miscellaneous provisions not affected by Code. 
                  Nothing in this Code or in the resolution adopting this Code shall affect: 
                  (1)  Resolution Number 92-6, adopted April 14, 1992, which adopted by reference the White County Comprehensive Plan 2010, or any amendment thereto. 
                  (2)  Resolution Number 94-6, adopted January 27, 1994, which adopted by reference the Mountain and River Corridor Protection Plans as an amendment to the White County Comprehensive Plan, or any amendment thereto. 
                  All such resolutions are hereby recognized as continuing in full force and effect to the same extent as if set out in this Code. 
                  Sec. 50-2. - Development agreement. 
                  (a)  Definition. A development agreement is a negotiated agreement between the county and a developer. It shall include large-scale development that will be phased and constructed over an extended period of time. The development agreement shall be in demand by developers to bring certainty to this Code that will govern the development over the established time. In reciprocating to "lock in" the current development regulations for the development over the established time period, the county shall receive agreement from the developer to install infrastructure or take other agreed upon actions that further the public interest. 
                  (b)  Title. This section shall be the "Development Agreement Resolution of White County, Georgia". 
                  (c)  Findings. 
                  (1)  The development agreement shall be employed at the discretion of the county where a developer proposes a guarantee that the county's current land use and development regulations shall remain fixed during the established time period of the prospective land development. 
                  (2)  The county, conversely, shall seek concessions and land development conditions beyond what it could reasonably require through current regulations under the normal exercise of its authority or police power. 
                  (3)  Developers shall voluntarily enter into a development agreement with the county that will limit the property use(s), and may specify other limitations, even though the county does not have regulations governing land use as of June 6, 2006. In return the development agreement shall benefit the developer by "locking in" the development regulations that apply to a particular development even in the event that the county subsequently adopts land use regulations. 
                  (4)  Developers shall also enter voluntarily into a development agreement with the county for two other important reasons even if no land use regulations currently apply to a proposed development. 
                  a.  The developer may need the cooperation of the county in extending infrastructure, and such cooperation may not be forthcoming in the absence of concessions voluntarily submitted to by the developer in the form of a development agreement. 
                  b.  Knowledge of a pending development may stir public interest and even if the county has no land use regulations, the development agreement becomes a flexible negotiating instrument whereby the developer can submit to certain concessions, i.e. limits on land uses that will satisfy neighborhood concerns. 
                  (5)  The county similarly shall voluntarily enter into a development agreement in certain instances. The county may have an interest in limiting land uses in order to protect the health safety and welfare of county citizens. Without the mechanism of a development agreement and in the absence of land use regulations, the county has no control over the quality, extent and location of a proposed development. The county shall also support entering into development agreements in cases where infrastructure to serve the development may be necessary, but no existing regulation exists to require such improvements. 
                  (6)  The county board of commissioners therefore finds that a negotiated development agreement, voluntarily submitted by a development applicant and involving infrastructure improvements and limits on land use and development regulations, shall be in the best interests of the county and the development community and within the proper scope of the county's police powers. 
                  (d)  Purpose. 
                  (1)  The purpose of a development agreement is to: 
                  a.  Vest certain development rights in the landowner/developer in exchange for construction and dedication of public improvements, certain restrictions on land uses and other concessions on the part of developer. 
                  b.  Allow the developer who needs additional discretionary approval now or in the future to acquire long-term project approval, regardless of any local regulations subsequently adopted. 
                  c.  Provide assurances that the applicant may proceed with the project in accordance with all applicable local statues, resolutions, rules and policies in existence at the time the development agreement is executed and that the project will not be restricted or prohibited by the county's subsequent enactment or adoption of laws, resolutions, rules or policies. 
                  d.  Derive public benefits that may include, but are not limited to, restrictions on land uses, limits on development intensity and location, design standards and on and off site infrastructure and other improvements. 
                  (2)  The county is ensured a mechanism for negotiating such benefits in return for the vesting of development rights for a specific period. 
                  (3)  It is therefore the specific purpose of this section to authorize the county board of commissioners to exercise its police powers to enter into individual development agreements and to specify the content and procedures for such development agreements. 
                  (e)  Authority to enter into development agreements. The county board of commissioners hereby exercises its police powers to negotiate and enter into a voluntary development agreement upon application of a developer. The procedure for entering into a development agreement and the contents of any development agreement shall be consistent with the requirements of this resolution. 
                  (f)  Application. Any person having a legal or equitable interest in real property which meet or exceed the development of regional impact (DRI) threshold, as administered by the state department of community affairs, may make application to enter into a development agreement with the county. The county shall establish an application fee to recover the direct costs associated with holding a public hearing and providing notice thereof. 
                  (g)  Required contents of a development agreement. Any application for a development agreement, and any development agreement itself, shall contain at minimum the following provisions: 
                  (1)  Definitions. The agreement shall contain a definition of all technical terms and define terms found in applicable statutes or resolutions the same way. 
                  (2)  Parties. All parties to the agreement shall state their capacities to enter into the agreement stated and their equitable or legal interests in the property. 
                  (3)  Relationship of the parties. The relationship between the parties to the agreement shall be clearly stated. Typically, the statement will specify that the relationship is contractual and that the owner/developer is an independent contractor and not an agent of the county. 
                  (4)  Property. The agreement shall include a thorough identification of the property subject to the agreement and a map and legal description incorporated into the agreement by reference. 
                  (5)  Intent of the parties. The agreement shall specifically include: 
                  a.  Statements of intent by all the parties bound by the agreement; 
                  b.  Representation that the developers have an equitable or legal interest in the real property and that all other persons holding legal or equitable interests in the real property are bound by the agreement; 
                  c.  Provisions stating the rights and obligations of the property owner in the event of the property's transfer or assignment. The agreement shall be a covenant running with the land, recorded upon the title records that the agreement and all covenants apply to the property. The county shall be notified 90 days prior to any transfer or reassignment of any or all portions of the real property affected by a development agreement; 
                  d.  Time deadlines for action by the developer or property owner; and 
                  e.  A statement that failure to meet the time deadlines may cause the agreement to terminate. 
                  (6)  Recitation of benefits and burdens. 
                  a.  The agreement shall recite the benefits each party expects to gain from entering into the agreement as well as the burdens each party agrees to bear. 
                  b.  Because the agreement is a contract, the consideration each party is to receive from the other shall be stated clearly in order to ensure enforceability. 
                  c.  The benefits to the county and the community expressed in terms that exhibit the agreement is consistent with or as an exercise of the police power. 
                  (7)  Notice and hearings. 
                  a.  The county shall provide for a hearing on the proposed agreement. The agreement shall contain the date of the public hearing, relevant findings resulting from such hearing and all other pertinent notice and hearing requirements. 
                  b.  At least 15, but not more than 45, days prior to the date of the hearing, the county shall cause to be published within a newspaper of general publication (the legal organ) within its territorial boundaries a public notice of the hearing. The notice shall state the time, place and purpose of the hearing. 
                  c.  A sign, measuring at least 24″×24″, containing information required by this resolution shall be placed in a conspicuous location on the property and visible from the adjoining property and/or street or road not less than 15 days prior to the date of the hearing. The sign shall state the time, place and purpose of the hearing. 
                  (8)  Applicable land use regulations. 
                  a.  The agreement shall contain a precise statement of all land use and development regulations to which the development project will be subject. The agreement shall specify precisely which regulations will apply to the project regardless of future changes or otherwise affected by the agreement. The statement shall clearly state that regulations not specifically so identified that will not be affected by the terms of the agreement, and will be subject to enforcement and change under the same criteria that would apply if no agreement were in effect. The development agreement shall specify that, unless otherwise provided, the rules, regulations, official policies governing permitted uses of the land governing density, design, improvement and construction standards and specifications applicable to the development of the property subject to a development agreement, shall be those rules, regulations and official policies in force at the time of execution of the agreement. 
                  b.  The agreement shall also specify that the county agrees to accept from the property owner for processing and review all development applications for development permits or other entitlements for the use of the real property in accordance with this agreement submitted in accordance with county rules and regulations and the fees paid. 
                  (9)  Approval and permit requirements. The agreement shall specify all: 
                  a.  Discretionary approvals and permits necessary before the development can proceed beyond its various stages; and 
                  b.  All conditions precedent to the obtaining of the permits and approvals. 
                  (10)  Uses permitted under the agreement. The agreement must specify:

                  (12)  Dedications and reservations. The agreement shall provide, where appropriate, a statement of any land or improvements dedicated to the county or land reservations made by the developer for public purposes, and the specific time for such dedications and reservations as they relate to the date of entering into the agreement. 
                  (13)  Utility connections. The agreement shall describe all water and sewer service in detail, together with schedules of construction completion, cost allocation between or among developers and government and later developers, hookup or connection schedules, and parameters for permitting, including fees for utility provision and service. 
                  (14)  Duration of the agreement. The agreement shall state a termination date, project commencement and completion dates, for the project either overall, or for its various phases.

                  (1)  Facilities engaging in the land application of human waste and septage or commercial waste, or both, shall be located on tracts of at least 100 acres. The acreage requirement is necessary to minimize any adverse impact arising from the operations of such facilities by having sufficient areas to provide for active waste treatment areas that meet the setback and buffer requirements of this article. Due to the inherent nature of human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both, such facilities need sufficient area to minimize the impact of offensive odors and provide sufficient area to serve as a setback to and buffer of adjoining property and the creeks, streams, and rivers of the county. 
                  (2)  a.  Facilities engaging in the land application of human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both, shall not be located within any district designated by White County as a mountain protection district, a river corridor protection district, a water supply watershed protection district, a groundwater recharge protection district, a wetlands protection district, a protection district containing habitats of endangered or threatened species or districts containing historic or archeological areas and structures including, but not limited to, family cemeteries. The protection districts shall have those uses allowed by the White County Code, and federal and state law (except not allowing land application systems as provided herein), and with the applicable provisions of the White County Code concerning said protection districts attached hereto as "Appendix 3" and incorporated into this article by reference thereto. (Note that certain historical or archeological areas have been designated and recorded as such by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, but have not been generally disclosed to the public in order to prevent looting and degradation of said sites). 
                  b.  Applicant must verify with the county planning department that the proposed site does not contain historic or archeological areas or historic family cemeteries which do not appear upon the hereinafter-referenced map and that the active waste treatment areas are set back 1,000 feet away from said sites and have a 300-foot natural buffer to said sites. The board of commissioners, simultaneously with the passage of this article, hereby adopts a land use and zoning map for the unincorporated areas of the county, which designates the: 
                  1.  Mountain protection districts; and 
                  2.  River corridor protection districts; and 
                  3.  Water supply watershed protection districts; and 
                  4.  Ground water recharge protection districts; and 
                  5.  Wetlands protection districts; and 
                  6.  Protected habitat of endangered or threatened species districts; and 
                  7.  The historic and/or archeological area; and 
                  8.  Structures protection districts (as well as designating the general use districts). 
                  c.  The area within the public lands being national forest and state parks within the unincorporated area of the county is not subject to this article due to the jurisdiction of federal or state law. The remaining unincorporated area, not contained within the above-referenced protection districts and public lands being national forest and state park area, shall be general use districts (said districts allowing any general use of property so long as said use does not violate the terms of this article or any other provision of the White County Code, or general law, or any combination thereof) and available for facilities engaging in the land application of human waste and septage or commercial waste, or both, so long as an applicant first receives a special use permit and land compliance letter from White County, Georgia, and the application of said applicant meets the requirements, rules and regulations of this article. The attached land use and zoning map is incorporated into this article by reference as "Appendix 1" 
                  d.  The map adopted simultaneously with this article and labeled "Appendix 1", shall be signed by the chairman of the board of commissioners and the county clerk, dated as of the date of adoption and the county seal shall be affixed thereto. In the discretion of the board of commissioners, the board may create duplicate originals of the map, identified in the same way and maintained by the county clerk. The county clerk shall maintain the map and amendments thereto in the county clerk's office as a public record, accessible and available to the public. The county clerk shall be responsible for maintaining the map and any amendments to the map. The board of commissioners, in their discretion, from time to time, may adopt a new map, to correctly display revisions to the map and which also shall be a public record maintained by the county clerk. The county clerk shall provide copies of the map to the public in accordance with the Open Records Act policies of the county. 
                  e.  The protection district regulations adopted simultaneously with this article and labeled "Appendix 3" shall be signed by the board of commissioners chair and the county clerk, dated as of the date of adoption and the county seal shall be affixed thereto.

                  (3)  a.  Facilities engaging in the land application of human waste and septage or commercial waste, or both, shall have a minimum of 200 feet of frontage upon a state highway or road classified as a minor arterial roadway according to the comprehensive plan of the county (and have sufficient frontage to accommodate the deceleration lane required herein). As a condition of receipt of a special use permit and land compliance letter from White County regarding a facility engaged in the land application of human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both, said site shall have a commercial driveway that meets the standards for commercial driveways promulgated by the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) at the time of the application for the special use permit and land compliance letter, or shall post a performance bond and payment bond payable to White County in an amount sufficient to construct said commercial driveway, and which commercial driveway shall be from the access point of the state highway or county road classified as a minor arterial roadway and which shall proceed to any active waste treatment area upon the property in order to allow emergency vehicles of White County access to the active waste treatment areas. The current GDOT regulations for "driveway and encroachment control" are attached hereto as "Appendix 2" and incorporated into this article by reference hereof, as the minimum standards that must be met regarding the commercial driveway. 
                  b.  The GDOT regulations adopted simultaneously with the article labeled as "Appendix 2" shall be signed by the board of commissioners chair, the county clerk, dated as of the date of adoption and the county seal affixed thereto. The county clerk shall maintain the GDOT regulations and revisions in the county clerk's office and shall be a public record, accessible and available to the public. The board of commissioners, in their discretion, from time to time, may adopt new GDOT regulations, and which also shall be a public record maintained by the county clerk.

                  (4)  Facilities engaged in the land application of human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both, have significant truck traffic to transport the human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both to the active waste treatment area(s) of the facility. In order to prevent the volume of truck traffic from creating a traffic safety hazard as a part of any application for a special use permit and land compliance letter from the county, the applicant shall submit and provide a traffic impact study by a professional engineer to the county and which designates the estimated amount of truck traffic, a determination of ingress and egress routes for the trucks, and any necessary road improvements that will be needed due to the increased truck volume caused by the operations of the facility. The director of planning shall have the right to have the traffic impact study independently evaluated by a qualified expert, and require any road improvements recommended by the independent expert. 
                  The applicant shall be responsible for constructing any road improvements determined to be needed by the traffic impact study at no cost to the county or post a performance bond and payment bond as provided hereinafter, prior to the issuance of a special use permit and land compliance letter by the county. The owners of the land, the operator of the facility or both shall fund and construct a left turn lane and a deceleration lane at the facility's entrance, which meets the standards imposed by the state department of transportation (GDOT) for commercial driveways. The current GDOT regulations for "Driveway and Encroachment Control" are attached hereto as "Appendix 2" and incorporated into this article by reference hereof, as the minimum standards that must be met regarding the deceleration lane (and also includes the minimum standards for the commercial driveway). Said improvements shall be constructed prior to the issuance of a special use permit and land compliance letter by the county or upon application for a special use permit and land compliance letter, applicant shall submit a payment bond and a performance bond payable to the county in a sufficient amount to allow construction of said improvements. 
                  (5)  Facilities engaged in the land application of human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both, shall meet the setback restrictions required by this article. Any active waste treatment area of a facility engaged in the land application of human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both, shall be 1,000 feet from any exterior property line of the parcel upon which the facility is located, and 1,000 feet from any stream, creek, or river lying upon the parcel upon which the facility is located or which adjoins the exterior property lines of the parcel upon which the facility is located, and shall be one thousand 1,000 feet from the geographical boundaries of any other governmental entity, and which shall be a condition of the special use permit and land compliance letter. Violation of this condition shall be due cause for suspension or revocation of the special use permit and land compliance letter after prior written notice and a hearing before the board of commissioners regarding said noncompliance, and the suspension or revocation process shall comply with section 50-10. A finding by the board of commissioners after the hearing process that this condition has been violated shall entitle the board of commissioners through a proper county agent to issue a stop-work order at the facility, and shall also entitle White County to injunctive and other relief to either require compliance with the condition, or have the facility cease operations, in the event of a suspension or revocation of the permit. Applicant at the time of application shall submit a survey or site plan by a registered land surveyor that demonstrates that this condition can be met. 
                  (6)  The owner shall provide a minimum 300-foot natural, undisturbed buffer between all active waste treatment areas and exterior property lines except for approved perpendicular access and utility crossings, and which shall be a condition of the special use permit and land compliance letter. Violation of this condition shall be due cause for suspension or revocation of the special use permit and land compliance letter after prior written notice and a hearing before the board of commissioners regarding said noncompliance, and the suspension or revocation process shall comply with section 50-10. A finding by the board of commissioners after the hearing process that this condition has been violated shall entitle the board of commissioners through a proper county agent to issue a stop-work order at the facility, and shall also entitle White County to injunctive and other relief to either require compliance with the condition, or have the facility cease operations, in the event of a suspension or revocation of the permit. 
                  (7)  The owner shall preserve the limits of any 100-year floodplain or a stream buffer of 300 feet, whichever is greater, as a natural, undisturbed area between all active waste treatment areas and floodplains, creeks, streams and rivers except for approved perpendicular access and utility crossings, and which shall be a condition of the special use permit and land compliance letter. Violation of this condition shall be due cause for suspension or revocation of the special use permit and land compliance letter after prior written notice and a hearing before the board of commissioners regarding said noncompliance, and the suspension or revocation process shall comply with section 50-10. A finding by the board of commissioners after the hearing process that this condition has been violated shall entitle the board of commissioners through a proper county agent to issue a stop-work order at the facility, and shall also entitle White County to injunctive and other relief to either require compliance with the condition, or have the facility cease operations, in the event of a suspension or revocation of the permit. 
                  (8)  All active waste treatment areas, which shall include, but not be limited to the sprayfields, shall be fenced with a minimum six-foot high chain-link security fence, and which shall be a condition of the special use permit and land compliance letter. The fencing requirement, besides preventing vandalism, also prevents wild and domestic animals from entering into the treatment areas, and tracking waste to other areas within White County. Violation of this condition shall be due cause for suspension or revocation of the special use permit and land compliance letter after prior written notice and a hearing before the board of commissioners regarding said noncompliance, and the suspension or revocation process shall comply with section 50-10. A finding by the board of commissioners after the hearing process that this condition has been violated shall entitle the board of commissioners through a proper county agent to issue a stop-work order at the facility, and shall also entitle White County to injunctive and other relief to either require compliance with the condition, or have the facility cease operations, in the event of a suspension or revocation of the permit. In lieu of the actual construction of the fences prior to the issuance of the special use permit and land compliance letter, a payment bond and a performance bond payable to White County, and in a sufficient amount to allow construction of said fences, may be posed with the application for a special use permit and land compliance letter. 
                  (9)  Offensive odors from the operations of a facility engaged in the land application of human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both, is a regular cause of citizen complaint, and is disruptive and injurious to the peace of the community. In order to minimize the adverse impacts of offensive odors from such facilities, the owner shall fully enclose all the active waste treatment areas with the exception of the sprayfields. All unloading, transfer, and loading areas related to the treatment of human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both, within the active waste treatment area shall occur indoors, and the structure shall be equipped with a ventilator system and odor neutralizer system, sufficient to neutralize the offensive odors of human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both. The enclosure of these areas shall be a condition of the special use permit and land compliance letter. Violation of this condition shall be due cause for suspension or revocation of the special use permit and land compliance letter after prior written notice and a hearing before the board of commissioners regarding said noncompliance, and the suspension or revocation process shall comply with section 50-10. A finding by the board of commissioners after the hearing process that this condition has been violated shall entitle the board of commissioners through a proper county agent to issue a stop-work order at the facility, and shall also entitle White County to injunctive and other relief to either require compliance with the condition, or have the facility cease operations, in the event of a suspension or revocation of the permit. In lieu of the actual construction of the enclosing structure or structures prior to the issuance of the special use permit and land compliance letter, a payment bond and performance bond payable to White County, and in a sufficient amount to allow construction of said enclosing structures, may be posted with the application for a special use permit and land compliance letter. 
                  (10)  The system design and components of the system shall be subject to review and approval of the White County Director of Planning and Development only as to the system design and components being consistent with the system design and components submitted to and/or approved by the Environmental Protective Division (EPD) of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in order to receive a permit from EPD. The verification that the system design and components is or has been as submitted to and/or approved by EPD is not to impose additional requirements regarding system design and components, but merely to verify that the system design and components is or as has been submitted to and/or approved by EPD. The White County Director of Planning and Development shall find that this condition of the special use permit and land compliance letter has been met upon a determination that the system design and components are the same as has been submitted to and/or approved by EPD. In lieu of the actual construction of the system prior to the issuance of the special use permit and land compliance letter, a payment bond and a performance bond payable to White County, and in a sufficient amount to allow construction of said system, may be posted with the application for a special use permit and land compliance letter. Compliance of the system with the EPD permit shall be a continuing condition of the special use permit and land compliance letter. Violation of this condition shall be due cause for suspension or revocation of the special use permit and land compliance letter after prior written notice and a hearing before the board of commissioners regarding said noncompliance, and the suspension or revocation process shall comply with section 50-10. A finding by the board of commissioners after the hearing process that this condition has been violated shall entitle the board of commissioners through a proper county agent to issue a stop-work order at the facility, and shall also entitle White County to injunctive and other relief to either require compliance with the condition, or have the facility cease operations, in the event of a suspension or revocation of the permit. 
                  (11)  Improper operation of facilities engaged in the land application of human waste and septage or commercial waste, or both, can result in toxic areas or brown fields. Therefore prior to the issuance of a special use permit and land compliance letter by the county, an applicant for said letter must demonstrate the existence of an adequate financial responsibility mechanism to demonstrate that sufficient funds will be available to meet specific environmental protection needs of said land application system site. 
                  (12)  A special use permit and land compliance letter for the operation of a land application system for human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both, shall not be granted unless the existence of an adequate financial responsibility mechanism has been provided to the White County Director of Planning and Development with the application. Such financial responsibility mechanism shall insure the satisfactory maintenance, closure, and post-closure care of such system site and the financial ability to carry out any corrective action, which is necessary to insure compliance with environmental standards after an incident, and which shall be a condition of the special use permit and land compliance letter. The director of planning shall evaluate the sufficiency of the amount of the financial responsibility mechanism by consultation with a professional engineering firm knowledgeable in the field of brownfield reclamation and considering the following factors: 
                  a.  The type of land application system; 
                  b.  The type of waste to be land applied to the site; 
                  c.  The effectiveness of the system; 
                  d.  The volume of waste; 
                  e.  The size of the land application areas; 
                  f.  The estimated cost to remove any toxic or hazardous material; and 
                  g.  Such other factors typically involved in brownfield reclamation. 
                  Based upon these factors and the recommendation of the expert, the director of planning can recommend to the White County Board of Commissioners a higher amount for the financial responsibility mechanism which may be imposed as a condition of the special use permit and land compliance letter by the board of commissioners. Violation of this condition shall be due cause for suspension or revocation of the special use permit and land compliance letter after prior written notice and a hearing before the board of commissioners regarding said noncompliance, and the suspension or revocation process shall comply with section 50-10. A finding by the board of commissioners after the hearing process that this condition has been violated shall entitle the board of commissioners through a proper county agent to issue a stop-work order at the facility, and shall also entitle White County to injunctive and other relief to either require compliance with the condition, or have the facility cease operations, in the event of a suspension or revocation of the permit. 
                  (13)  As a part of the monitoring of the facility, and as a condition for the issuance of a special use permit and land compliance letter to a facility engaged in the land application of human waste and septage or commercial waste, or both, the applicant shall submit a pretesting plan that shall provide for the testing of waste accepted for treatment at the facility. As a condition of the special use permit and land application letter, the applicant will covenant and warrant that all waste shall be tested to determine that the waste proposed to be treated is waste that the facility is permitted by EPD to treat, and does not contain any hazardous or toxic materials that would disrupt the treatment process of the land application facility or which the facility is not permitted to treat. It shall be a continuing condition of the permit for the facility to test all waste, and the failure of the facility to test all waste shall be due cause for suspension or revocation of the special use permit and land compliance letter after prior written notice and a hearing before the board of commissioners regarding said noncompliance, and the suspension or revocation process shall comply with section 50-10. A finding by the board of commissioners after the hearing process that this condition has been violated shall entitle the board of commissioners through a proper county agent to issue a stop-work order at the facility, and shall also entitled White County to injunctive and other relief to either require compliance with the condition, or have the facility cease operations, in the event of a suspension or revocation of the permit. Applicant as a part of the special use permit and land compliance letter application, shall covenant and warrant to provide copies of all test results, to a designated agent of White County on a monthly basis for all waste accepted for treatment by the facility, on the first day of the following month. Failure to provide the monthly reports shall be due cause for suspension or revocation of the special use permit and land compliance letter after prior written notice and a hearing before the board of commissioners regarding said noncompliance, and the suspension or revocation process shall comply with section 50-10. A finding by the board of commissioners after the hearing process that this condition has been violated shall entitle the board of commissioners through a proper county agent to issue a stop-work order at the facility, and shall also entitle White County to injunctive and other relief to either require compliance with the condition, or have the facility cease operations, in the event of a suspension or revocation of the permit. Such testing is a part of the monitoring of the facility required by White County, and as allowed by O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30.3(d) and shall be in addition to any testing required by EPD. 
                  (14)  As a condition of receipt of the special use permit and land compliance letter, the applicant shall agree to provide to White County a copy of all reports and documents provided by applicant to EPD, including permit applications, renewals of applications, correspondence with EPD regarding the facility in White County, tests and reports provided by applicant to EPD regarding said facility, and any and all records provided by applicant to EPD regarding said facility. The timely provision of this documentation by applicant/permittee to White County is a condition of the special use permit and land compliance letter. Violation of this condition shall be due cause for suspension or revocation of the special use permit and land compliance letter after prior written notice and a hearing before the board of commissioners regarding said noncompliance, and the suspension or revocation process shall comply with section 50-10. A finding by the board of commissioners after the hearing process that this condition has been violated shall entitle the board of commissioners through a proper county agent to issue a stop-work order at the facility, and shall also entitle White County to injunctive and other relief to either require compliance with the condition, or have the facility cease operations, in the event of a suspension or revocation of the permit. The applicant/permittee shall provide to White County the documentation required by this subsection, at the same time that the applicant/permittee provides the reports and documentation to EPD. 
                  (15)  The facility engaged in the land application of human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both, under the rules and regulations of EPD is required to have a manifest of the waste transported to said facility. As a part of the monitoring of said facility, and as a continuing condition of the special use permit and land compliance letter by White County, applicant/permittee shall provide a copy of said manifest on a monthly basis to a designated agent of White County, with said manifest indicating the origination of the human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both, the transporter for said waste, the amount of waste received, what type of waste received, a cross index to the pretesting requirement of said waste, and shall be provided on a monthly basis to a designated agent of White County on the first day of the following month. The operator of the facility shall have a right to designate parts of the manifest that meet the definition of confidential proprietary information as such information, and White County shall redact said confidential information from any copies of the manifest made available to the general public as a public record. Violation of this condition shall be due cause for suspension or revocation of the special use permit and land compliance letter after prior written notice and a hearing before the board of commissioners regarding said noncompliance, and the suspension or revocation process shall comply with section 50-10. A finding by the board of commissioners after the hearing process that this condition has been violated shall entitle the board of commissioners through a proper county agent to issue a stop-work order at the facility, and shall also entitle White County to injunctive and other relief to either require compliance with the condition, or have the facility cease operations, in the event of a suspension or revocation of the permit. The providing of the copies of the manifest by the applicant/permittee to White County shall be a part of the monitoring of the facility pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30.3(d), and will be in addition to any manifest requirements imposed by EPD. 
                  (16)  As a condition of the issuance of the special use permit and land compliance letter by White County, the applicant shall covenant and warrant that the facility engaged in the land application of human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both, shall only operate during the days of Monday through Friday, and shall only operate during daylight hours. These operational days and hours shall be a condition of the special use permit and land compliance letter. Violation of this condition shall be due cause for suspension or revocation of the special use permit and land compliance letter after prior written notice and a hearing before the board of commissioners regarding said noncompliance, and the suspension or revocation process shall comply with section 50-10. A finding by the board of commissioners after the hearing process that this condition has been violated shall entitle the board of commissioners through a proper county agent to issue a stop-work order at the facility, and shall also entitle White County to injunctive and other relief to either require compliance with the condition, or have the facility cease operations, in the event of a suspension or revocation of the permit. In the event that any permit issued by EPD specifically and expressly allows operations by the facility on Saturday and/or Sunday, and during night hours, then the provisions of the EPD permit shall control, but otherwise said facility shall be subject to this condition. 
                  (17)  a.  All special use permits and land compliance letter applications for facilities engaging in the land application of human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both shall be subject to a public hearing before the board of commissioners, which shall be advertised by White County, once each week for four consecutive weeks prior to the hearing in the legal organ of White County. The advertisement shall not be placed in the legal classified section of the newspaper, but shall instead be an ad prominently displayed within the newspaper. The applicant shall pay for the cost of advertisement with payment received by the legal organ prior to the issuance of the special use permit and land compliance letter. The legal notice shall include the date, time and place of the public hearing, name of the applicant, proposed operator of the facility, location of the property, the present use of the property and that the applicant proposes to use the property for a facility engaged in the land application of human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both. 
                  The applicant shall place a sign containing the same information in a conspicuous location on the property visible by the public from a public way, not less than 15 days prior to the date of the hearing. 
                  b.  The board of commissioners shall conduct all public hearings in accordance with any procedures adopted by said body, and, in addition, shall be governed by the following procedures: 
                  1.  The chair, or other presiding officer should another person be designated by the board to act as the presiding officer, shall open the hearing by stating the specific application being considered at the public hearing. At this time, the presiding officer may summarize the public hearing procedures. 
                  2.  The director of planning or other agent of the county may present a description of the proposed application, any applicable background material, his/her recommendation, if any, regarding action on said application as appropriate, and the recommendation and reports of the planning department, if any, as appropriate. 
                  3.  Persons who support the application shall comment first. The applicant may, upon recognition and upon statement of name and address, present and explain his application. The board expects the applicant to attend the public hearing unless the applicant provides written notice of hardship prior to such hearing/meeting. A time limitation may be imposed at the discretion of the presiding officer, but no less than ten minutes total (not per person) shall be provided for all of those speaking in support of the special use permit and land compliance letter. 
                  4.  Persons who oppose the application of who have questions about the subject application will be asked to comment next. All interested parties after being recognized shall be afforded an opportunity to address the proposed application by standing before the board of commissioners and identifying their name, address and interest along with any comments on the proposed application. A time limitation may be imposed at the discretion of the presiding officer, but no less than ten minutes total (not per person) shall be provided for all of those speaking against an application for a special use permit and land compliance letter. 
                  5.  The applicant shall have an opportunity to answer any questions raised by the public, for summary remarks and rebuttal concerning the proposed application. 
                  6.  Upon the completion of any comments from interested parties and the applicant, the public hearing shall be completed and adjourned. 
                  7.  Having heard all of the public comments, the members of the board of commissioners may discuss the application among themselves. During this discussion period, the members of the board may call on the applicant or other interested parties to clarify points made previously or to answer questions. Said applicant or interested parties may respond upon recognition. Once the public hearing has closed, the public may not ask additional questions. Once the public hearing is closed or a vote or other action is under consideration, unrecognized responses from the applicant or public shall result in the presiding officer ruling the participants out of order. 
                  (18)  a.  Following the public hearing concerning a special use permit and a land compliance letter application for a facility engaging in the land application of human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both, the board of commissioners shall grant or deny the application based upon whether the board determines that the proposed facility is consistent with the policies and objectives of the comprehensive plan, particularly in relationship to the proposed site and surrounding area, and consistent with the factors set out by this article, and can met the conditions required by this article. The board shall consider the potential adverse impacts on the surrounding area, especially with regard to traffic, noise, odors, storm drainage, land values and compatibility of land use activities including whether the area contains property primarily used for residential purposes. The board shall also consider the following criteria concerning the grant or denial of a special use permit and land compliance letter application for a facility engaging in the land application of human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both: 
                  1.  The existing uses of nearby property and whether the proposed facility will adversely affect the existing use or usability of nearby property; 
                  2.  The extent to which property values of the property upon which the facility is to be sited would be diminished by the conditions imposed by the special use permit and land compliance letter; 
                  3.  The extent to which the destruction of the property values of the property upon which the facility is to be sited would promote the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public; 
                  4.  The relative gain to the public, as compared to the hardship imposed upon the individual property owner; 
                  5.  The physical suitability of the subject property for the facility, and other possible uses as to which the property is suited; 
                  6.  The length of time the property has been vacant, considered in the context of land development in the area near the property, and whether there are existing or changed conditions affecting the use and development of the property which gives supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the special use permit and land compliance letter application request; 
                  7.  The development history and land use history of the subject property; 
                  8.  The extent to which the proposed facility would result or could cause excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation, facilities, utilities, police protection, fire protection, public health facilities, emergency medical services, or other public facilities; 
                  9.  Whether the proposed facility is in conformity with the policy and intent of the comprehensive plan, land use plan, or other adoptive plans; 
                  10.  Whether the proposed facility is a use that is suitable in view of the use, development, and use of adjacent and nearby property; 
                  11.  Whether the proposed site for the facility has a reasonable economic use currently; 
                  12.  Whether the proposed facility would create an isolated commercial use unrelated to the surrounding uses; 
                  13.  Whether the proposed facility is out of scale with the needs of the county as a whole or the immediate neighborhood; and 
                  14.  Such other factors as are deemed relevant by the board of commissioners before taking action on a particular application. 
                  b.  The board of commissioners shall adopt administrative policies regarding the conduct of the public hearing upon special use permit and land compliance letter applications but which do not conflict with the minimum requirements set by this article. 
                  c.  In addition to the operational conditions imposed by subsection (a)(16), the board of commissioners may impose such other conditions upon the facility as are necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of area residents, which are consistent with state and federal regulations. The board of commissioners shall make its decision to grant to deny the application immediately following the public hearing, unless the hearing reveals a need for additional information before a decision can be made, and at which event the application shall be tabled until the next regular meeting of the board and decided in that meeting. 
                  In the event that the board of commissioners denies the application for a special use permit and land compliance letter or the applicant withdraws the application prior to the vote, the same property cannot be considered for a special use permit and land compliance letter until at least 12 months following the denial or withdrawal of the application. 
                  (19)  The White County Planning Department shall issue written notification of the decision of the White County Board of Commissioners regarding an application for a special use permit and land compliance letter for a facility engaging in the land application of human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both. The planning department shall issue the written notification to applicant within five business days of the decision of the White County Board of Commissioners. The decision of the White County Board of Commissioners shall be the final administrative action by White County, but an applicant shall have a right to appeal the decision of the White County Board of Commissioners to the White County Superior Court by way of a writ of certiorari granted by the Superior Court. (See also section 50-12). Applicant shall follow the statutory process for the grant of a writ of certiorari by the Superior Court, including the provision of a bond that would cover the county's costs and expenses regarding the permit, including all of the costs to meet the conditions of the permit, as wexlll as the County's attorney fees and other expenses in having to respond to the appeal. If the Board of Commissioners of White County grants the special use permit and compliance letter, then the White County Building Department may issue a building permit for the facility upon the condition that all conditions of the permit will be met, and all requirements of all other county ordinances and regulations have been met. The building department following its standard process, shall also issue a certificate of completion and a certificate of occupancy for the facility upon the requirements and conditions of the special permit and compliance letter being met, as well as all other county ordinances and regulations applicable to said facility being met. 
                  (20)  The special use permit and land compliance letter shall be valid for one year, and be subject to renewal upon the anniversary date of the grant of the permit, so long as the facility complies with the conditions required by the permit. The infrastructure improvements required to be constructed by the conditions of the permit must be constructed within one year of the issuance of the notification of the grant of the permit by the White County Board of Commissioners. It is the responsibility of the applicant to apply for the building permits required by the White County Building Department for the facility and pursuant to the county ordinances and regulations. Failure to complete the construction of the infrastructure within the one-year period will require the applicant to restart the process to receive a new special use permit and land compliance letter. Upon written application of a holder of a special use permit and land compliance letter submitted at least two months prior to the end of the one-year construction period, and for good cause shown, the board of commissioners in their discretion, may grant an extension of time to complete the infrastructure improvements upon the further condition that the applicant pay the annual monitoring and regulatory fee of $2,500.00 required by subsection (a)(21) at the time of requesting the extension. Failure to construct the infrastructure improvements within the one-year period of time, unless extended, shall be due cause for the board of commissioners to not issue a renewal of the permit upon its anniversary date (and with the board following the suspension or revocation process required by section 50-10). A finding by the board of commissioners after the hearing process that the construction has not been completed within the time allowed shall entitle the board of commissioners through a proper county agent to issue a stop-work order at the facility, and shall also entitle White County to injunctive and other relief to require the holder of the permit to stop work and begin again the process to be issued a new special use permit and land compliance letter. 
                  (21)  Applicant for a special use permit and land compliance letter, at the time of submission of the application, shall also submit an application fee for said permit and land compliance letter in the amount of $5,000.00. Said fee is in part an application fee, but is also a regulatory fee and fee to offset the cost of monitoring the facility. In the event the board of commissioners denies the application, then the applicant shall receive a refund of $2,500.00. Should the board of commissioners grant the application, then the board shall retain the entire fee in order to offset the county's regulatory and monitoring costs of insuring compliance with this article by the applicant. Applicant at the time of application shall also make any disclosures required by the Conflict of Interest and Zoning Actions Act, being O.C.G.A. § 36-67A-1 et seq. All local government officials required to make disclosure under said Act shall do so upon becoming aware of the application and the conflict of interest. The special use permit and land compliance letter shall only be valid for one year from the date of the grant of the application by the board of commissioners. One month prior to the annual anniversary date of the grant of the permit, and one month prior to each annual anniversary thereafter, the holder of the permit shall make a renewal application to receive another special use permit and land compliance letter valid for one year, and shall pay a regulatory and monitoring fee of $2,500.00 to White County. The renewal applicant upon the renewal application shall covenant and warrant that all conditions of the special use permit and the land compliance letter have been met in the prior year, and will be met in the year for which a renewal application is submitted. Upon receipt of the regulatory and monitoring fee, and upon verification that the permit conditions were met during the prior year, White County shall issue a special permit and land compliance letter for the renewal year. Violation of any conditions of the permit shall be due cause for suspension, revocation, or denial of the renewal of the special use permit and land compliance letter after prior written notice and a hearing before the board of commissioners regarding said noncompliance, and the suspension, revocation, or denial process shall comply with section 50-10. A finding by the board of commissioners after the hearing process that any condition has been violated shall entitle the board of commissioners to deny a renewal application, and also entitle White County to injunctive and other relief to have the facility cease operations. 
                  (22)  Besides the administrative relief of a stop work order, and the injunctive and other equitable relief allowed by this article to White County, any person violating any provision of this article, as such exists from time to time, shall be guilty of violating a duly adopted ordinance of White County, and upon conviction of such violation shall be punishable as a misdemeanor, pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 15-10-60, subject to a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 and subject to imprisonment for no more than 60 days or both, except as otherwise provided by general law, or by subsequent amendment of O.C.G.A. § 15-10-60. O.C.G.A. § 15-10-60 et seq. shall govern the trial of any violation of this article, and any violation of this article may be tried upon citation as contemplated by O.C.G.A. § 15-10-63. Each day during which the violation, failure or refusal to comply continues, including failure or refusal to comply with permit conditions, shall constitute a separate violation. 
                  (23)  a.  Facilities already engaging in the land application of human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both, within the unincorporated limits of White County as of May 28, 2009, are exempt as to current operations from the land site provisions as to location and necessary infrastructure and being subsections (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (16), (17), (18), (19), (20) and (21) of section 50-7(a) as a legal nonconforming use, but shall be subject effective 30 days after the passage of this amendment to the ordinance (being February 8, 2010) to those provisions requiring pretesting, the requirement regarding the providing of copies of manifests, providing copies of all reports and documents provided to EPD, verification that the system design and components are in accordance with the EPD permit, and the requirement regarding the financial responsibility mechanism and being subsections (10), (11), (12), (13), (14), (15), and (22) of section 50-7(a). Any expansion of any active waste treatment area of a facility operating as a legal nonconforming use shall meet all requirements of this article. 
                  b.  Facilities already engaged in the land application of human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both, during the 30 days following passage of this amendment to the article (being effective February 8, 2010), shall apply to White County for a nonconforming use permit, upon the 31 st day after passage of this article amendment, and comply with subsections (10), (11), (12), (13), (14), and (15) of section 50-7(a) of this article, and the failure to comply shall entitle the board of commissioners through a proper county agent to issue a stop-work order at the facility, and shall also entitle White County to injunctive and other relief to either require compliance with the condition, or have the facility cease operations. As an additional remedy, White County shall also have the authority to cite the facility in accordance with subsection (22) of section 50-7(a) of this article. Upon application for a nonconforming use permit, the facility shall pay a regulatory and monitoring fee of $2,500.00 to offset White County's cost in determining a reasonable financial mechanism amount and other costs of regulation and monitoring of said facility. 
                  c.  The applicant for a nonconforming use permit shall covenant and warrant upon his application that the applicant will meet the requirements of the subsections applicable to such facilities (being subsections (10), (11), (12), (13), (14), (15) and (22) of section 50-7(a)), and these applicable conditions shall be continuing conditions of the permit. The nonconforming use permit shall only be valid for one year from the date of the grant of the application by the board of commissioners. One month prior to the annual anniversary date of the grant of the permit, and one month prior to each annual anniversary thereafter, the holder of the permit shall make a renewal application to receive another nonconforming use permit valid for one year, and shall pay a regulatory and monitoring fee of $2,500.00 to White County. The renewal applicant upon the renewal application shall covenant and warrant that all conditions of the nonconforming use permit have been met in the prior year, and will be met in the year for which a renewal application is submitted. Upon receipt of the regulatory and monitoring fee, and upon verification that the permit conditions were met during the prior year, White County shall issue a nonconforming use permit for the renewal year. Violation of any conditions of the permit shall be due cause for suspension, revocation, or denial of the renewal of the nonconforming use permit after prior written notice and a hearing before the board of commissioners regarding said noncompliance, and the suspension, revocation, or denial process shall comply with section 50-10. A finding by the board of commissioners after the hearing process that any condition has been violated shall entitle the board of commissioners to deny a renewal application, and also entitle White County to injunctive and other relief to have the facility cease operations. Any facility operating under a nonconforming use permit that is destroyed or ceases operation for a month or more (excepting shortterm closures for normal maintenance of the facility), shall lose the right to continue operations as a nonconforming use and said facility must go through the special use permit and land compliance letter procedure and meet all conditions required by this article at the time of application in order to begin operations again.

                  Sec. 50-10. - Suspension and revocation; grounds and procedure. 
                  (a)  Except as provided in section 50-11, no permit, or renewal permit, which has been issued or which may be issued pursuant to this article shall be suspended, revoked or denied (as to a renewal permit regarding the denial) except for due cause and after hearing and upon prior ten-day written notice to the holder of the permit of the time, place and purpose of the hearing, and a statement of the charges upon which the hearing shall be held. 
                  (b)  The term "due cause" for the purposes of this section shall include, but not be limited to: 
                  (1)  Determination of a violation of any federal law, state law, federal regulation, state regulation, or county ordinance regarding the land application of human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both, including but not limited to the conviction of, or the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendre, or the entering into of a consent order, by the permittee or any of the permittee's employees or any person holding an interest in the permit as to a violation. 
                  (2)  A determination of, including but not limited to conviction of, or the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendre, or the entering of a consent order, by the permittee or any of his employees or any person holding an interest in the permit for any violation of the facility's state permit regarding land application of human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both. 
                  (3)  Suspension, revocation, or the entering of a consent order regarding any state permit required as a condition for the operation of a land application system regarding human waste and septage, or commercial waste, or both. 
                  (4)  Material falsification of any fact given in an application for a permit or renewal permit issued under this article or bearing upon the permittee's qualification therefore. Any act which may be construed as a subterfuge in an effort to circumvent any of the qualifications for a permit under this article shall be deemed a violation of the requirement attempted to be circumvented.

With respect to this subsection, it shall be rebuttably presumed that the violative act was done with the knowledge or consent of the permittee; provided, however, that such presumption may be rebutted only by evidence which precludes every other reasonable hypothesis save that such permittee did not know, assist or aid in such occurrence, or in the exercise of full diligence that such permittee could not have discovered or prevented such activity. 
                  (c)  Notice of the suspension or revocation of a permit, or the denial of a renewal permit, proceedings shall be served on the person named as permittee in the permit.

                  (e)  Hearings shall be only as formal as necessary to preserve order and shall be compatible with the principles of justice. The county attorney or other designated agent shall present the county's case and bear the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that due cause exists to suspend or revoke the permit, or to deny a renewal permit. At the hearing, the permittee shall have the right to represent itself or be represented by counsel, may cross-examine all witnesses offered by the county, and may call witnesses and present evidence in its own behalf. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings under this section, although the board of commissioner shall have the right to exclude evidence which carries no indicia of reliability. All testimony shall be offered under oath or affirmation. 
                  (f)  The board of commissioners shall make their final determination within ten days of the completion of the hearing. The decision shall be placed in writing and contain the Board of Commissioners' findings of fact, conclusions of law, and decision with related penalties, if any. Such penalty may include one or more of the following: 
                  (1)  Suspension of the permit for no more than 12 months;

                  (h)  A revocation of a permit may constitute due cause for the denial of any application for a renewal permit, or as due cause for the denial of an application for a new permit by the same permittee. Such a denial is subject to appeal by writ of certiorari in accordance with section 50-12.

                  (b)  A short-term emergency suspension by the board of commissioners must be for an emergency cause. Emergency cause for the short-term suspension of a permit shall consist of a violation of a permit condition which puts the county and the health and safety of its citizens at such risk that an immediate suspension is necessary until a hearing as provided for in section 50-10 can be held. 
                  (c)  If the violation of the permit condition which necessitated the emergency suspension is not cured during the initial suspension, then the board of commissioners can extend the emergency suspension until the date of a hearing before the board and following the procedures of section 50-10.

                  Any person adversely affected by a denial of an application for a permit, a suspension or revocation of a permit, or a denial of a renewal permit, by the board of commissioners and desiring to appeal further must do so by writ of certiorari directly to the Superior Court of White County within 30 days of such adverse decision. The decision of the board of commissioners is the final administrative decision for White County, and there is no other appeal to any other body other than by way of writ of certiorari directly to the Superior Court of White County.

                  The director of public works will rank all roads within each functional classification utilizing the following formulas: 
                  (1)  For unpaved county roads: Ranking equals (average daily traffic count divided by rating number) multiplied by type factor multiplied by classification factor and then multiplied by the cost per mile for county maintenance; or 
                  R = (ADT/rate) × type × class factor × cost per mile; and 
                  (2)  For paved county roads: Ranking equals rate multiplied by type factor multiplied by classification factor; or 
                  R = Rate × type × class factor; 
                  where: 
                  a.  Average daily traffic count, if required in the formula, is to be supplied by the planning director; 
                  b.  Rating number of a road is determined by the planning director and public works director utilizing: 
                  1.  PACES rating system of the state department of transportation for paved roads; and 
                  2.  Special Report 8-15, latest version of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers "Rating Unsurfaced Roads" for unpaved roads in the county. 
                  c.  Type factor is: 
                  1.  "Two" for an unpaved road; and 
                  2.  "One" for a paved road. 
                  d.  Classification factor is: 
                  1.  "Two" for roads classified by the director of public works as an artery; 
                  2.  "One and one-half" for roads classified by the director of public works as minor artery; and 
                  3.  "One" for roads classified by the Director of Public Works as local road. 
                  e.  Cost per mile is determined by using the cost of road maintenance for the last ten months and dividing that by the length of the road.

                  a.  A driveway shall be located and restricted as to width as necessary so that the entire driveway and its appurtenances are contained within the frontage along the roadway of the property served. At public roadway intersections a driveway shall not provide direct ingress or egress to or from the public roadway intersection area and shall not encroach on or occupy areas of the roadway or right-of-way deemed necessary for effective traffic control or for roadway signs or signals. A driveway shall be so located and constructed that vehicles approaching or using it will have adequate sight distance in both directions along the roadway (see figure 6 at the end of this article). 
                  b.  The number of driveways permitted serving a single property frontage shall be a maximum of two unless the director deems more necessary by for reasonable service to the property without undue impairment of safety, convenience and utility of roadway. 
                  c.  If the property has frontage on more than one street, the director may request a recommendation from the director of planning as to the potential adverse affects, which may result. If it is determined that the construction of such a driveway would cause a nuisance to the surrounding area, a traffic hazard or unduly congested traffic, the director shall deny the permit. 
                  d.  Subdivision of arterial street frontage where a tract of land is subdivided on an arterial street after the adoption of this provision such that a lot with less than 60 feet of frontage is created, access to such lot shall be from either: 
                  1.  A driveway serving the remainder of the tract from which the lot was cut; or 
                  2.  A joint driveway; or 
                  3.  A frontage road; or 
                  4.  An adjacent non-arterial street if a corner of double-frontage lot. 
                  e.  The island area on the right-of-way between successive driveways or adjoining a driveway and between the roadway shoulder and right-of-way line shall remain unimproved for vehicular travel or parking. Such areas shall be considered as restricted and may be filled in or graded down only as hereinafter provided in subsection h. of this section. 
                  f.  The surface of the driveway connecting with rural type roadway sections shall slope down and away from the roadway shoulder a sufficient amount and distance, to preclude ordinary surface water drainage from the driveway area flooding onto the roadway roadbed. In cases where terrain will not allow adequate surface water drainage, the director will determine the best possible typical section to ensure the least amount of surface water flooding the roadbed. 
                  g.  The driveway shall not obstruct or impair drainage in side ditches or roadside areas. Driveway culverts, where necessary, shall be adequate for surface water drainage along the roadway and in no case be less than equivalent of 15-inch diameter corrugated metal pipe. The director shall determine culvert diameter during the driveway permitting process. The distance between culverts under successive driveways shall be not less than ten feet except as provided for in subsection h of this section. 
                  h.  When driveway construction requires the removal of curb and gutter, the new connections shall be of equivalent acceptable material and curb returns provided or restored in a neat, competent manner acceptable to the director. The driveway surface shall connect with the roadway pavement and the sidewalk, if any, in a neat, competent manner. The driveway construction shall include replacement due to vehicular travel across the sidewalk. 
                  i.  The restricted area between successive driveways may be filled in or graded down only when the following requirements are fully complied with: 
                  1.  The filling or grading down to grades approved by the director, water drainage shall be directed away from the roadway except where drainage is by means of curb and gutter. 
                  2.  Culvert extension under the restricted area shall be of like size and equivalent acceptable material of the driveway culvert, and intermediate manholes or drop inlets adequate for clean-out purposes may be required where the total culvert length exceeds 60 feet. The director must approve any deviation to this length. 
                  3.  Permanent provision may be required to separate the area from the roadway roadbed, to prevent its use for driveway or parking purposes by construction of a border, curb, rail or posts deemed adequate by the director where no side ditch separates the restricted area from the roadbed. 
                  (Ord. No. 2009-13, 6-1-09) 
                  Sec. 54-200. - Specific design standards. 
                  (a)  The following specific design standards shall apply to driveways requiring permits as set forth in these regulations: 
                  (1)  Driveway width; and 
                  (2)  Angle of entry and exit; and 
                  (3)  Return radius of curb; and 
                  (4)  Maximum percent of frontage for driveway use; and 
                  (5)  Distance to side property lines ; and 
                  (6)  Island areas; and 
                  (7)  Intersection clearance; and 
                  (8)  Parking and storage area; and 
                  (9)  Driveway grade. 
                  (b)  Commercial driveways shall meet the regulations for driveway and encroachment control promulgated by the state department of transportation (GDOT) in order to receive a driveway permit and a final occupancy permit, except where the director has determined a deviation for a lesser standard due to constraints dictated by the local terrain. The current GDOT "Regulations for Driveway and Encroachment Control" are attached hereto as "Appendix 1" and incorporated into this article by reference hereof, as the minimum standards that must be met regarding commercial driveways. The GDOT regulations adopted simultaneously with this article and labeled "Appendix 1", signed by the chairman of the board of commissioners and the county clerk, dated as of the date of adoption and the county seal be affixed thereon. 
                  (c)  The county clerk shall be responsible for maintaining the GDOT regulations and amendments, which the county commissioners may adopt from time to time as a public record. 
                  (d)  If design standards in this regulation conflict with the GDOT "Regulations for Driveway and Encroachment Control," the more restrictive standard shall prevail. 
                  (1)  Driveway widths measured parallel to roadway shall be as follows: 

                   
                  (2)  Driveway angles of entry and exit shall be as follows: 
                  a.  Apartments, 75 to 90 degrees for two-way driveways or 45 to 90 degrees for one-way streets; and 
                  b.  Commercial, 75 to 90 degrees, for two driveways or 45 to 90 degrees for one-way on divided roadway or 60 to 90 degrees for one-way ramp on non-divided roadway; and 
                  c.  Industrial, 90 degrees, or as close as practicable for two-way or 45 degrees, one-way access on one-way street; and 
                  d.  Rural, land access only, 60 to 90 degrees. 
                  (3)  Return radius of curb shall be as follows: 

                   
                  (4)  Maximum percent of frontage for driveway use: 
                  a.  Single driveways shall have a maximum width of 30 percent of the property frontage. Two or more driveways shall have no more than 60 percent of property frontage shall be used as driveways. 
                  b.  Where it is apparent that the intent is not to provide access but to provide parking only, The Director shall not issue an approval. A driveway approach must provide access to something definite on private property such as a parking area considerably greater in extent than the width of the driveway, or provide access to a driveway, or to a door at least nine feet wide intended for the entrance of vehicles, etc. (Not applicable for residential driveways.) 
                  (5)  Distance to side property lines: The development of a driveway is permissible on public right-of-way (E) within five feet of the frontage boundary line. 
                  a.  A minimum of one and one-half feet of pavement edge or curb, shall be left undisturbed adjacent to each frontage boundary line to serve as an island area. This measurement is the distance between the frontage boundary line and the point of tangency of the driveway radius and edge of pavement, measured along the edge of pavement. 
                  b.  Subsection "a" or "b" of this section shall apply, whichever is more restrictive. 
                  c.  The director may waive these requirements when a single driveway serves two adjacent lots. 
                  (6)  Island areas. 
                  a.  Minimum island dimensions: 
                  1.  The distance between double driveways (D) shall be 20 feet minimum at the narrowest point at the street side; and 
                  2.  The minimum island depth shall be four feet where parking abuts street right-of-way line. 
                  b.  Treatment of island or buffer area. In the development of private property and the construction of driveways thereto, it may be necessary to re-grade the buffer area by cutting or filling. Such work shall insure adequate sight distance for traffic operations, proper drainage, suitable slopes for maintenance operations, and good appearance. The grading, use of curbs, rails, guideposts, low walls, low shrubs, etc. in a manner, which will not impair clear sight across the area shall prohibit vehicles in the buffer area. 
                  c.  Visibility clearance. No landscaping, fences, terraces or other natural or artificial features adjacent to any street shall be of a nature impairing visibility from or of approaching vehicular traffic where such visibility is important to safety, nor shall such features in any way create potential hazards to pedestrians. 
                  d.  Also prohibited at vehicular entrances and exits are off-street parking, landscaping or other material impediment to visibility between the height of three feet and ten feet measured from the roadway level within the triangular areas defined by lines connecting points described as: 
                  1.  Nonresidential use. Beginning at a point where the midline of the entrance or exit intersects the public right-of-way thence to a point of 25 feet along the right-of-way in the direction of approaching traffic, thence to a point of 25 feet toward the interior of the lot along the midline of the entrance or exit, and thence to a point of beginning. See figure 5A at the end of this article. 
                  2.  Multifamily residential use. Beginning at point where the midline of the entrance or exit intersects the public right-of-way, thence to a point of ten feet along the right-of-way in the direction approaching traffic, thence to a point of ten feet toward the interior of the lot along the midline of the entrance or exit, and thence to point of beginning. See figure 5B at the end of this article. 
                  (7)  Intersection clearance. The length, width and shape of corner island areas will vary for different locations. The angle of intersection, angle of driveways, width of the right-of-way on both approaches, channelization radii, and other conditions will influence the location of driveways at intersections. The location and angle of an approach in relation to the roadway intersection shall be such that a vehicle: 
                  a.  Leaving the service facility may be merged in the lane of traffic moving in the desired direction before crossing the intersection; and 
                  b.  Entering the facility from the intersection may do so in an orderly and safe manner with a minimum of interference to through traffic. 
                  (7.1)  The following conditions may be applicable in most instances: 
                  a.  No driveway shall encroach upon pavement edge radii. 
                  b.  The following minimum distances from the intersection right-of-way line (C) shall apply where there is no conflict with the foregoing conditions: 
                  1.  Average daily traffic of 1,500 or less, 20 feet; and 
                  2.  Average daily traffic over 1,500 but less than 10,000, 35 feet; and 
                  3.  Average daily traffic over 10,000 but less than 15,000, 50 feet; and 
                  4.  Average daily traffic over 15,000, 65 feet. The director shall have the authority to increase these distances if in his opinion such action is necessary for the protection of traffic. The director may also modify these requirements if justifiable based on site conditions; and 
                  5.  The planning department may provide projected traffic volumes in determining minimum distances rather than current traffic volumes. 
                  (8)  Parking and storage areas. 
                  a.  Each roadside business establishment, when providing off-street parking or storage space, shall provide such parking or storage space off the right-of-way to prevent the storage of vehicles on the driveway or the backing up of traffic on the travel way. The need is for businesses where a number of vehicles will be leaving and entering at the same time. 
                  b.  The director shall pay particular attention to drive-in facilities such as banks, minute car washes, drive-in restaurants, drive-in bill paying facilities and other service facilities that serve motorist while in their vehicles, to insure that queues of vehicles will not extend out onto the public streets. 
                  (9)  Driveway grade. 
                  a.  Apartments, commercial and industrial driveways. The maximum grade permitted is eight percent. 
                  b.  Existing shoulder slope, utilities or existing and future sidewalk elevations in the right-of-way shall determine the grade. 
                  c.  The underside clearance and/or break over angle of driveways for special use vehicles shall dictate the maximum driveway grade. 
                  (10)  Paving. 
                  a.  When driveways access paved county roads, the pavement shall continue to the right-of-way line, prescriptive easement line or be paved 20 feet in length, whichever option is greater. 
                  b.  The paving of acceleration and deceleration lanes is required. Pavement structure shall at least match that of the adjoining existing pavement and shall not be less than specified in writing or drawings by the county director. Materials and construction methods shall meet county standards. 
                  (11)  Left-turn restrictions. 
                  a.  On arterial streets and if in the judgment of the director necessary on collector and local streets, left turns into or out of driveways shall be denied by the construction of channelizing structures under the following conditions: 
                  1.  Inadequate corner clearance; or 
                  2.  Inadequate sight distance; or 
                  3.  Inadequate driveway spacing; or 
                  4.  Site has a signalized driveway on the same arterial at which left turns can be made; or 
                  5.  Other capacity, delay or safety conditions make specific left turns dangerous. 
                  (12)  Acceleration, deceleration lanes. 
                  a.  Required. If driveways provide access to a non-residential use facility utilizing a common driveway entrance on an arterial street, the property owner shall construct acceleration and deceleration lanes. An acceleration lane shall not generally be required, but the driveway radius shall turn out as if construction of a lane and taper were to be constructed. An acceleration lane shall be required where the required taper will merge with the taper of an existing deceleration lane or is within 20 feet of merging. 
                  b.  Length. Each such lane shall be 150 feet in length, with an additional tapered transition section 50 feet in length. Lane pavement width shall be 12 feet. 
                  c.  Property lines. The director may approve an altered design where a lane or taper would merge with a lane or taper provided for adjoining property or would encroach on the corner radius of a street intersection. If there is adequate, right-of-way in front of the adjoining, property and a lane or taper would extend across a frontage boundary line such lane or taper shall be constructed 
                  d.  Right-of-way dedication. The property owner by way of recorded right of way deed shall dedicate any additional right-of-way necessary for construction of a lane and the abutting curb and gutter and the accommodation of utilities to the county. 
                  e.  All driveways requiring acceleration or deceleration lanes shall have site plans submitted to and approved by the director. A performance bond or letter of credit will be required in an amount equal to all work proposed for acceleration or deceleration lanes in the county right of way. 
                  f.  Exceptions. The following land uses are excluded from the requirement for acceleration/deceleration lanes: 
                  1.  Warehouse use with less than 10,000 square feet of building area; and 
                  2.  Manufacturing use with less than 13,000 square feet of building; and 
                  3.  Light industrial use with less than 7,000 square feet of building area; and 
                  4.  Heavy industrial use with less than 33,000 square feet of building area; and 
                  5.  Nursing home with fewer than 19 beds; and 
                  6.  Medical office use with less than 1,000 square feet of building area; and 
                  7.  General office use with less than 3,000 square feet of building area; and 
                  8.  Office park (mixed office uses) with less than 2,000 square feet of building area. 
                  g.  A mixture of the above uses will require a case-by-case determination of traffic generation by the director. Acceleration/deceleration lanes shall be required when sufficient additional development occurs on property previously excepted from the requirement. 
                  (13)  Temporary driveways. Temporary condition permits are typically driveways constructed to perform logging operations or other short duration activity such as construction entrances. Where property owner's desire access to property but will delay building upon that property for six months or longer, a temporary driveway may be used. The director based on use, needs of the property owner, and considerations towards protecting county right of way and roadways, will consider design standards for any temporary driveway case by case. 
                  (14)  The department shall permit all driveways, regardless of use or type, in collaboration with planning and building inspections.

                  (a)  The following specific design standards apply to common access driveways requiring permits as set forth in these regulations. Even though a common access drive may provide access to parcels or lots, each resultant, tract, parcel or lot shall meet the minimum public street frontage requirements for the county unless otherwise exempted as a lot of record. Sites upon which there is a proposed subdivision of land that will not have separate and individual driveway access to a public street within the limits of the property itself, but is proposed to be served by a common access driveway shall install such a driveway in conformance to the standards. 
                  (1)  Permit requirements. Any: 
                  a.  Building permit or occupancy permit requested for lots of record; or 
                  b.  Proposed subdivision of land, whereby three but not more than five parcels or lots are to be served by a common access driveway shall at the time of the permit application or proposed subdivision of property, submit all necessary plans as required by the director indicating the proposed location and construction specifications of the proposed common access driveway. 
                  (2)  Construction prior to plat approval. New common access driveways shall be constructed prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit for lots of record or prior to the approval and recording of a final plat for the proposed subdivision of land. 
                  (3)  Plats—Required statements. The contractor shall record plats indicating the location of common access driveway easements and the lots served with the clerk of superior court of the county. The plats shall include: 
                  a.  A statement to the effect that the driveway easement shown on the plat is not to be dedicated as a public road and not to be maintained by the county, but shall be privately maintained; and 
                  b.  A statement signed by the surveyor, a registered engineer or registered landscape architect that the driveway meets the minimum standards of the county. 
                  (4)  Previously existing driveways. Any existing easements or common driveways recorded prior to the effective date of this amendment shall continue to serve existing lots recorded prior to the effective date of this resolution. Any new driveways, which would propose access to three or more undeveloped lots of record, shall conform to the standards for a common access driveway in accordance with this amendment. 
                  (5)  Minimum standards. Construction of common access driveways shall conform to the following minimum standards: 
                  a.  Easement width, 30 feet; and

                  b.  Concrete, six inches thick; and 
                  c.  Pavement or concrete is not necessary on common driveways where said driveways access unpaved roads. 
                  (7)  If a common access driveway terminates in a dead end, the termination shall be a cul-de-sac with a paved radius of 25 feet. 
                  (8)  Ditch front slope, three to one ratio. 
                  (9)  Maximum finished driveway grade, 15 percent. 
                  (10)  Grass all slopes and shoulders. 
                  (11)  Minimum cross drain pipe size, 18 inches. 
                  (12)  The driveway shall intersect the public road at an angle of 65 degrees or greater. 
                  (13)  The driveway shall enter the public road at least 65 feet from any intersection of another common access driveway or another public road intersection. 
                  (b)  The following design layouts are in conjunction with the standards and definitions set forth in this article as examples of typical driveway types. 
                  (Ord. No. 2009-13, 6-1-09) 
                  Sec. 54-202. - General conditions of approval. 
                  (a)  The following conditions shall apply to all approvals for driveway construction on public right-of-way: 
                  (1)  The applicant shall represent all parties with a property interest in the proposed driveway and shall certify that any driveway or approach constructed by him is for the bona fide purpose of securing access to his property and not for the purpose of parking or servicing vehicles, or for advertising, storage, or merchandising of goods on the county right-of-way. 
                  (2)  The applicant shall furnish all materials, do all work and pay all costs in connection with the construction and maintenance of the driveway and its appurtenances on the right-of-way unless the county agrees otherwise. The applicant shall arrange for and bear the entire cost of moving poles, trees, signs, hydrants, catch basins, and other existing installations, which may interfere with the proposed driveway. Materials used and type and character of work shall be suitable and appropriate for its intended purpose, and the type of construction shall be designated and subject to approval of the county director. The building official and/or director shall approve the timetable for installation. The applicant shall make the installation without jeopardy to or interference with vehicular traffic using the roadway or pedestrian traffic using the adjacent sidewalk. The applicant shall restore street surfaces, shoulders, ditches and vegetation disturbed to equivalent or original condition. 
                  (3)  The director shall approve all revisions or additions to the driveway or its appurtenances on the right-of-way. 
                  (4)  The county reserves the right to make such changes, additions, repairs and relocations within statutory limits to the driveway or its appurtenances on the right-of-way as may at any time be considered necessary to permit the relocation, reconstruction, widening, and maintaining of the roadway or to provide proper protection to life and property or adjacent to the street. The county shall make all reasonable attempts to comply with all provision of this resolution. 
                  (5)  The applicant, his successors or assignees, agree to hold harmless the county and its duly appointed agents and employees against any action for personal injury or property damage sustained by reasons of the exercise of the permit issued pursuant to this chapter. 
                  (6)  When making improvements to existing roads by reconstruction or maintenance work, the county shall alter existing entrances to the road to conform to the spirit and intent of the policy and standards set forth in this article. 
                  (7)  Whenever the county director determines that inadequate or indiscriminate access or long stretches of paved or unpaved accesses result in a hazard to the motoring public on the thoroughfare, existing entrances may be required to be altered or reduced in extent to conform with the spirit and intent of this policy and upon approval of the governing authority. 
                  (8)  The director has the authority to allow deviations to this article where terrain negatively affects the ability to meet the specifications herein. The director will determine a typical section and driveway design that best meets the county's needs to protect the county roadway and still allow driveway access where possible.

                  Sec. 58-1. - Objectives. 
                  The objectives of this article include but are not limited to the following: 
                  (1)  Provide a reasonable balance between the right of an individual to identify his or her business or express their thoughts and the right of the public to be protected against the visual discord resulting from the unrestricted proliferation of signs and advertising devices. 
                  (2)  Guard against an excess of large, aesthetically unappealing, intense signs which cause visual blight on the appearance of the community. Visual blight adversely affects the aesthetic quality of life and traffic safety in the community for residents, businesses, pedestrians, and persons in vehicles. 
                  (3)  Protect the public health, safety and general welfare while protecting the rights of sign owners to expression and identification. 
                  (4)  Provide regulations that vary the sign area based on the type of land use, and based on need which is determined in part by the type of road frontage to which signage is directed. 
                  (5)  Provide regulations which are content-neutral. It is not the intent to regulate the content of messages in any way. To accomplish this, these regulations do not distinguish between on-site or off-site sign content, nor do they distinguish between commercial and noncommercial content. Any sign permitted pursuant to this article may contain commercial or non-commercial content. Sign allowances in this article take into account the needs for off-premise signs and signs carrying messages of a noncommercial character. 
                  (6)  Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs. 
                  (7)  Insure that signs are compatible with adjacent land uses and with the total visual environment of the community. 
                  (8)  Eliminate excessive and confusing sign displays. 
                  (9)  Preserve and improve the appearance of the community as a place in which to live and to work and as an attraction to nonresidents who come to visit or trade.

No new sign shall be permitted to be erected on the same property until the discontinued sign including supports has been removed or is converted to a lawfully conforming sign.

                  b.  The application of this chapter to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship; and

However, the determination of the director of community and economic development shall remain in full force and effect pending such review. 
                  (f)  Appeal to the board of commissioners. Decisions or actions of the planning commission are subject to an appeal to the board of commissioners. However, the planning commission's action or decision shall remain in full force and effect pending such appeal. 
                  (g)  If an applicant desires to appeal a decision or action of the planning commission, the applicant shall notify the board of commissioners in writing within ten days of the action or decision of the planning commission.

                  (k)  Investigations and reports.

                  (e)  When the full amount of such charges are not paid by the violator within 30 days after receipt of said statement as provided for in this section, the board of commissioners shall cause to be recorded in the execution docket a sworn statement showing the cost and expense incurred by the county, the dates of county action, the location of the property for which action was taken, and the name of the person to be charged for the expenses incurred.

The entrance access road and public rights-of-way leading to the sites shall be policed as necessary to control all litter and trash which would give the convenience center an unsightly appearance. Depositing solid waste within any transfer station or convenience center property other than as designated by the controlling authority or littering of any transfer station or convenience center road or property shall be deemed a violation of this article.

                  Preliminary plats, development plans, and final plats shall meet the specifications of Table 5.2. 
                  TABLE 5.2  PLAT AND PLAN SPECIFICATIONS 

                   
                  Footnote 1: Contour intervals ten feet for hilly terrain (slopes greater than ten percent), five feet for rolling terrain (two—ten percent) two feet for flat terrain (slopes less than two percent). Contour lines shall be based on field surveys or photogrammetric methods for aerial photographs. The basis for the topographic contour shall be specified. Topographic data based on geological survey maps which have been adjusted by field survey data may be accepted by the County if it determines that such data will be adequate to evaluate the layout of lots and streets, drainage and other service requirements. 
                  Section 506. - Application for preliminary plan approval. 
                  The administrative officer shall transmit for review and comment a copy of the preliminary plat to the county plan review committee as required. 
                  The subdivider shall submit to the planning department, or its designated representative the following information for review and approval by the planning department, within the procedures established by the department. 
                  a.  A letter requesting review within the procedures established by that department. 
                  b.  Seven (7) copies of the preliminary plan and other documents, as specified.

                  Upon receipt of a complete preliminary plat and plat application, the administrative officer shall schedule the application for the next public meeting before the planning commission and forward all pertinent materials in the application to the planning commission for review. An application for preliminary plat approval must be submitted to the administrative officer for review and approval by the planning department within the procedures established by the department. The applicant or his or her authorized representative shall attend the planning commission meeting at which preliminary plat approval is sought. No action will be taken by the planning commission on a preliminary plat approval unless the subdivider or his or her authorized representative is present. The failure of an applicant to attend the meeting at which a preliminary plat application is scheduled for consideration by the planning commission shall delay the time limitations posed in this section. 
                  Meetings of the planning commission during which a preliminary plat is considered shall be open to the public, but the planning commission shall not be required to provide notice to adjacent or nearby property owners of the application and shall not be required to convene a public hearing on the matter. This shall not preclude the planning commission from recognizing and hearing from any member of the public, when in its judgment it may be advantageous to do so. 
                  The planning commission shall have 30 days from the date it is first considers a preliminary plat application at a public meeting of the commission to approve, conditionally approve, or deny the application. The basis of the planning commission's review of and action on a preliminary plat shall be whether the preliminary plat meets the purposes and requirements of this resolution and other applicable laws. 
                  If action on a preliminary plat is not taken by the planning commission within 60 days of the meeting date on which the application was first considered by the planning commission, the preliminary plat shall be considered approved and a certificate of approval shall be issued on demand. However, the applicant may waive this requirement and consent to an extension of time. 
                  Section 508. - Duration of preliminary plat approval. 
                  Approval of a preliminary plat shall be valid for a period of one year, during which time a complete application for development plan approval must be submitted.

Phased subdivisions are allowed to have two 12-month extensions. 
                  Section 509. - Amendments to preliminary plat approval. 
                  The administrative officer, in consultation with the director of public works when engineering considerations are involved, is authorized to approve minor amendments to preliminary plats. The application requirements and procedures for amending preliminary plats, unless minor in nature, shall be the same as for preliminary plat applications. The administrative office shall have the discretion to determination the nature of a minor amendment. 
                  Section 510. - Submittal of development plans. 
                  Following approval of the preliminary plat for a land subdivision, or if subdivision is not proposed, upon proposing a land development, the subdivider or land developer shall submit an application for development plan approval per the requirements of table 5.1 for development plans. The development plans shall at minimum include information specified in table 5.2 for development plans. Said plans shall consist of the following:

                  d.  A complete final plat application has been submitted, including all supporting materials required by this resolution for final plats. 
                  Final plats and applications that meet the above-referenced conditions shall be considered a ministerial action by the administrative officer. Denial of a final plat shall be permitted only upon specific findings that one or more of the above-referenced conditions have not been met. 
                  If said plat is in conformance with the preliminary plat and is approved by the administrative officer, the signatures of the administrative officer shall be placed on the reproducible film copy or original plat. 
                  Section 516. - Recording of final plats. 
                  Upon approval and without undue delay, the administrative officer shall have approved final plats recorded in the records of the clerk of the superior court of the county, and a time-stable reproducible film copy or original shall be filed in the office of the administrative officer. Recording fees shall be included in the fee charged for final plats and therefore paid by the county. The clerk of the superior court shall indicate on the filed copy, as well as the time-stable reproducible film copy or original, the book and page number in the county records where the final plat is recorded. Recordation of a final plat constitutes approval to begin the sale or transfer of subdivision lots. 
                  Section 517. - Dedications of public streets and acceptance of improvements. 
                  In accordance with applicable provisions of the White County Code, the subdivider may petition in writing to the administrative officer for the county board of commissioners by resolution to accept public streets and other dedications, in whole or in part, within the subdivision.

                  Boundary line adjustments. One or more existing lot lines forming boundaries between conforming platted lots located within the same subdivision, or one or more lot lines between abutting lots may be adjusted through a final plat revision process that requires the approval of the administrative officer and recording of a plat meeting the specifications of a final plat. In the case no final plat applies to the subject lots or parcels, a boundary survey and plat of the entire lots involved in the boundary line adjustment shall be required to be approved by the administrative officer and recorded. Such plat showing said boundary line adjustment shall be titled with the same name as that of the original subdivision and shall include thereon that the replat is for the purpose of adjusting the lot lines between specific lots. 

                  Lot combinations. An existing lot line forming the boundary between two conforming platted lots located within the same subdivision or a lot line between lots or parcels that have merged, by the developer, to form one building lot may be removed or eliminated through a final plat revision process which conforms to the final plat requirements of this resolution. Where separate parcels or lots of land are proposed to be combined, they shall be submitted to the administrative officer as a final plat for review, approval and recording. In the case where no recorded final plat applies to the subject lots or parcels, a boundary survey and plat depicting all lots involved in the lot combination shall be required to be approved by the administrative officer and recorded as a final plat. Such combination plat shall be titled with the same name as that of the original subdivision, if applicable, and shall indicate thereon that the replat is for the purpose of removing the lot lines between specific lots. 

                  ARTICLE 6. - DESIGN REQUIREMENTS FOR STREETS

                  Every subdivision shall be accessed by a public street, or class I street, or a previously approved access of at least a 30-foot easement (a private street). This may include the extension of previously approved subdivision streets. 
                  If the planning commission or administrative official finds that inadequate access exists, the subdivider's remedy is to pursue the proper access to the subdivision by upgrading the access road to the subdivision. This shall require improving the access to current county road standards. In such cases of inadequate access, street or access improvements are required. A preliminary plat for the subdivision shall be required, regardless of the number of lots. 
                  Where existing streets serving the subdivision are inadequate to serve the additional traffic, the planning commission or administrative officer shall not approve the subdivision unless adequate access improvements are provided by the subdivider, which shall require improvements to county standards. 
                  Section 602. - Lot frontage. 
                  Each lot shall abut upon a public street or an approved subdivision street and at a minimum, have 60 feet of lot frontage. In the case of a lot fronting on and accessed by a, cul-de-sac, the minimum lot frontage may be reduced to 35 feet.

                  Section 608. - Development along arterial street or limited access highway. 
                  Where a subdivision abuts or contains an arterial street or a limited access highway, the Administrative Officer or Planning Commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way as a marginal access street, from which the lots shall be accessed instead of the arterial street or limited access highway. In such cases, the Administrative Officer or Planning Commission shall require a ten-foot-wide, no-access easement planted to prohibit travel across it. 
                  Section 609. - Alleys. 
                  Alleys may be required at the rear of all lots used for multi-family, commercial or industrial developments. Alleys may be provided in one or two-family residential developments.

Signs shall be installed in accordance with the current revision of the U.S. Hwy. DOT Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices. 
                  Section 623. - Street right-of-way improvements. 
                  All street rights-of-way outside of the paved portions shall be graded to conform to the approved cross section and shall be soiled and grassed with a material acceptable to the director of public works. 
                  The director of public works may require that drainage facilities be installed to provide a stable subsurface and base for fills and base course construction over wet weather springs, soft spots, and other unstable soils. The director of public works may require the subdivider or land developer to submit a soil analysis and drainage design performed by an engineering firm. 
                  Section 624. - Street trees. 
                  Street tree planting is required along all new collector and arterial streets in the county and private streets within commercial and industrial subdivisions. Street trees are optional but recommended in all other subdivisions. Trees should not encroach upon right-of-way or interfere with future maintenance by the county should the road become a public street. 
                  When required or where provided, the subdivider, owner of land to be dedicated as a public street, or the developer of a street shall at the time of preliminary plat approval submit a plan for the provision of street trees. It is the intent of this section that the subdivider carefully position street trees on the plan while taking into account future driveway and sidewalk locations, if provided. Suitable arrangements must be made for either the subdivider/developer or individual builders to install street trees according to a plan approved by the public works department as a part of preliminary plat approval, prior to dedication or opening of said street, or by the administrative official if a preliminary plat is not required. It is the preference of the county that the subdivider shall install said street trees prior to the dedication or opening of the public or private street; however, the planning commission may accept an agreement where the responsibility for street tree planting is shifted to the owners or individual builders of the lots to be subdivided. Any such responsibility shall be legally transferred in a form acceptable to the county attorney. 
                  Street trees and other shrubbery that may be retained or planted shall be placed or retained so as not to obstruct sight distances at street intersections. 
                  Section 625. - Sidewalks. 
                  Though not required, if sidewalks are employed in a subdivision they shall have a minimum width of four feet and shall be provided under the following conditions: 
                  a.  Sidewalks shall be installed, along the entire property frontage, or as may be otherwise specified by the administrative officer. Sidewalks shall not be less than two feet from street curbs. The sidewalk location may be varied at the discretion of the administrative officer in order to go around trees or other obstructions. 
                  b.  All driveway aprons over sidewalk areas shall be installed with concrete by the developer or builder. 
                  c.  Sidewalks thickness and material shall be determined by the public works department. Except as specified, alternative materials may be used, but must be approved by the public works department. 
                  Section 626. - Street lights. 
                  Street lights are not required but may be provided in accordance with county specifications by the developer of a subdivision prior to the approval of a final plat; provided however, that within mountain and/or hillside development areas as designed by resolution of the board of commissioners, low level street lights shall allowed in key areas and intersections. Fixtures and standards/poles installed or used shall be approved by the utility company which will be responsible for the maintenance of the facilities and by the director of public works. The fixtures shall be mounted no more than 30 feet above the ground and shall have appropriate arm length or power to place light over the street. Post-top luminaries may be permitted when approved by the director of public works. Fixtures shall be located no more than 500 feet apart, unless approved by the director of public works, and when provided at least one light shall be located at each public or private street intersection within the subdivision or land development. 
                  The developer, or homeowners' association, shall pay all costs for poles, fixtures and any other related items or materials necessary for the installation of street lights, as well as arrange an agreement with the utility company for complete maintenance of all installations. 
                  Section 627. - Deceleration lanes. 
                  For subdivisions or land developments accessing state routes, the state department of transportation may require the installation of deceleration lanes. 
                  The director of public works may require the installation of a deceleration lane for a distance of 100 feet and a 50-foot taper from all project entrances serving commercial and industrial subdivisions, and residential subdivisions serving 50 lots or more for accessing county roads. For all commercial properties, if an acceleration/ deceleration lane is not required, the subdivider or land developer may be required to construct a wide entrance according specifications of the director of public works. 
                  Section 628. - Improvements to abutting streets. 
                  For subdivisions and land developments that abut and access an abutting public street, the subdivider or land developer shall install road improvements according to standards and specifications of the director of public works along all abutting streets. 
                  When a subdivision or land development uses or proposes to use an unpaved public right-of-way for access, the subdivider or land developer shall dedicate right-of-way and improve that right-of-way to right-of-way and pavement widths consistent with county street design standards. 
                  Section 629. - Residential driveways. 
                  All entrances or exits of any driveway from or to any state or federal highway shall be subject to the approval of the state department of transportation. Any driveway that will abut a public street must obtain a driveway permit from the county public works. Public works will determine if the chosen driveway location is the best available for sight distance and will evaluate the correct size for the driveway culvert or give permission to omit the culvert. 
                  Section 630. - Nonresidential driveways. 
                  All entrances or exits of any driveway from or to any state or federal highway shall be subject to the approval of the state department of transportation.

                  Section 701. - Private streets permitted. 
                  Private streets may, upon application, be permitted by the planning commission within subdivisions, subject to the requirements of this article. Applications for approval of private streets shall be considered by the planning commission. Following a recommendation by the administrative officer and director of public works, the planning commission shall consider the application and may impose conditions on the approval of private streets to ensure various public purposes and to mitigate potential problems with private streets. No final plat involving a private street shall be approved unless said final plat conforms to the requirements of this article. 
                  Section 702. - Engineering plans required. 
                  It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to construct a new private street or alter an existing private street or to cause the same to be done without first obtaining approval of development plans and securing a development permit from the administrative officer and approval by the director of public works in accordance with the requirements of this resolution. 
                  Section 703. - Standards for private streets. 
                  All private streets shall be constructed to standards as specified in section 610 of this resolution. 
                  Section 704. - Street names and signs. 
                  Private streets shall be named, subject to the approval of the administrative officer and the mapping department. The subdivider of land involving a private street shall install street signs as approved by the director of public works. The sign signifying the private street may be required by the director of public works to be a different color than that of street signs provided for public streets, or designated "private" in order to distinguish maintenance responsibilities in the field. 
                  Section 705. - Rights-of-ways. 
                  Rights-of-way for private streets shall be designated on final plats as general purpose public access and utility rights-of-ways, along with the name of said private street. Said private right-of-way shall at minimum be of the same width as that required for the right-of-way of a public street for the type of public street (local, collector, etc.) most closely resembling the proposed private street. Rights-of-way for private streets shall not be included in any calculation of minimum lot size established by this resolution or any other county resolution. In the cases of private streets, the right-of-way for the private street shall be drawn as its own discrete parcel to be dedicated to a private homeowners association (i.e., not shown to be a part of any lot). 
                  Section 706. - Maintenance. 
                  The county shall not maintain, repair, resurface, rebuild, or otherwise improve streets, signs, drainage improvements or any other appurtenances within rights-of-ways established for private streets. A private maintenance agreement recorded with the county clerk of the superior court shall be required for any private street and other improvements within rights-of-ways established for private streets. 
                  Section 707. - Specifications for final plats involving private streets. 
                  No final plat involving a private street shall be approved by the administrative officer for recording unless and until it shall contain the following on the face of the plat: 
                  a.  Deed book and page reference to the recorded covenant required by this article. 
                  b.  "WARNING, White County has no responsibility to build, improve, maintain, or otherwise service the private streets, drainage improvements, and other appurtenances contained within the rights-of-ways for private streets shown on this plat." 
                  c.  If water and/or sewer lines are installed, the following certificate of dedication shall be required. 
                  "Certificate of Dedication. All water and sewer lines installed within the rights-of-ways shown on this plat for private street(s) are hereby dedicated to the White County Water and Sewer Authority. 
                  ___________  White County Water Authority 
                  ARTICLE 8. - DESIGN REQUIREMENTS FOR BLOCKS AND LOTS 

                  Section 801. - Block lengths and widths. 
                  Intersecting streets shall be provided at such intervals so as to provide adequate cross traffic and connectivity. Blocks in residential subdivisions should not exceed 1,800 feet nor be less than 600 feet in length, except where topography or other conditions justify a departure from these standards. In blocks longer than 800 feet, pedestrian ways and/or easements through the block may be required by the planning commission near the center of blocks. 

                  The width of the block shall normally be sufficient to allow two tiers of lots of appropriate depth. Blocks intended for business or industrial use shall be of such width as to be considered most suitable for their respective use, including adequate space for off-street parking and deliveries. 
                  Section 802. - Lot width and size. 
                  Residential lots shall have a minimum depth of 100 feet and minimum width of 100 feet each. 
                  Residential lots shall have a minimum depth of 100 feet and minimum width of 100 feet each. 
                  The minimum lot area for a residential lot shall be: 
                  a.  43,560 square feet. 
                  Provided, however, that where flood plain, water course, wetland, soil, slope and other conditions require it, and as further required by the county health department or any other applicable resolution of the county. No more than one single-family dwelling per tract with density of one dwelling per acre with planning department approval. Single-family exceptions may be allowed for intra-family and agricultural dwellings with the approval of the planning department. Residential corner lots shall have adequate width to meet building setback requirements from both abutting streets. Residential corner lots shall have adequate width to meet building setback requirements from both abutting streets. 
                  Commercial and industrial or other non-residential lots shall be adequate to provide service areas and off-street parking suitable to use intended. The minimum lot size for such lots shall be 43,560 square feet without public sewer, or a minimum of 21,780 square feet with public sewer and public water, or greater where soil, slope or other conditions require it, and as further required by the health department. Where individual septic tanks are used, the county health department shall approve minimum lot sizes to conform to health standards of the state. 

                  Each lot shall contain an adequate building site not subject to flooding and outside the limits of any existing easements or required yards/ building setback lines. 
                  (Res. No. 2017-02, 1-9-17) 
                  Section 803. - Lot lines. 
                  All lot lines shall be perpendicular or radial to street lines, unless not practicable because of topographic or other features. 
                  Section 804. - Building lines. 
                  A building line shall be established on all lots. There shall be building setback lines for principal buildings of 15 feet from all property lines. 
                  Section 805. - Flag lots. 
                  Intent. Flag lots, as defined in this resolution, are strongly discouraged. However, subdivisions designed with one or more flag lots may be approved. 
                  Denial if reasonable alternative exists. The administrative officer in the case of minor subdivisions and the planning commission in the case of other subdivisions shall have due cause to deny any plat that proposes any flag lot, when a reasonable alternative to such lot pattern is possible. 
                  a.  Panhandle (flag pole) length and width restriction. If permitted, no flag lot shall be allowed to be platted that has a "panhandle" portion of less thanthe requiredfrontage for that lot. (i.e., portion that does not meet the required lot width) and that is more than 400 feet in length. 
                  Section 806. - Lot remnants not permitted. 
                  All remnants of lots below any minimum lot size which may be required, left over after subdividing of a larger tract, must be added to adjacent lots, rather than allowed to remain as unusable parcels. The administrative officer may permit a lot remnant for a specific purpose such as a detention pond, provided that access and design is appropriate and the lot remnant is restricted to specific non-building use. 
                  Section 807. - Monuments. 
                  For all subdivisions, a state registered land surveyor shall install permanent survey monuments at all property corners and land lot lines, prior to final plat approval. Lot corners shall be marked with metal rods not less than one-half inch in diameter and 18 inches in length and driven so as to be stabilized in the ground. Permanent survey monuments shall also be installed in accordance with the most recent edition of section 180-7-.05, monument, of the Rules of State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors and the Georgia Plat Act (O.C.G.A. 15-6-67). 
                  ARTICLE 9. - STORM DRAINAGE AND UTILITIES 

                  Section 901. - Easements. 
                  Where a subdivision or land development is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, channel or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater or drainage easement of minimum 20 feet in width. Easements for storm pipes shall be at least ten feet wide, and all easements shall be provided for all drainage facilities as approved by the director of public works. Where easements are needed for utility locations, they shall be provided by the subdivider or land developer to the appropriate utility provider. Easements having a minimum width of 15 feet shall be provided, where required for utility lines and underground mains and cables. Where easements are needed for public water and/or sanitary sewer lines, they shall be provided as determined appropriate by the director of public works but shall be no less than 20 feet wide. All easements required pursuant to this section shall be shown on the preliminary plat if required, final plat if required, and development plans. 
                  Section 902. - Storm drainage system. 
                  No land shall be platted and no land shall be developed except in accordance with stormwater management standards provided in this resolution and additional specifications adopted by the director of public works. At a minimum, storm drainage in subdivisions and land developments shall meet the following requirements. 
                  The storm drains along with catch basins and manholes shall be installed in compliance with the plans and specifications, and as indicated herein. 
                  1.  Every subdivision or land development shall be served by storm drainage facilities, including drains, sewers, catch basins, culverts and other facilities as required by standards and specifications of the director of public works. 
                  2.  All drainage facilities shall be so designed to serve the entire drainage area in which these facilities are located. All street drains serving lots in the subdivision shall be installed by the subdivider. A formula may be developed by the director of public works to provide for a sharing of the cost of other drainage facilities needed to serve the subdivision when certain of the required drainage facilities are necessary to serve other subdivisions in the same drainage basin. 
                  3.  Storm sewers, where required, shall be designed by the rational method, or other methods as approved by the director of public works, and a copy of design computations shall be submitted along with required plans. Capacity for a ten-year storm or rain shall be provided for all street drainage structures such as catch basins, inlets cross drains, etc. Capacity for a 100-year frequency storm event shall be provided for all main drainage structures such as retention basins, principal storm sewers, and all types of flood protection works. 
                  4.  All surface water drainage shall be transported to existing storm sewers or to drainage facilities approved by the director of public works. Drainage shall be designed so as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from each lot or land development site to adjacent lots, land development sites, or vacant properties. Storm water shall not be discharged directly to perennial streams. It shall be directed toward natural drainages. If water must be discharged to a stream, the water quality flowing into the stream must meet or exceed the water quality in the receiving waters. The water quantity flowing into the stream must be evaluated to ensure the stream channel can accommodate the increased flows and not disrupt or degrade the ecology of the water body. 
                  5.  Whenever drainage ditches are used, such ditches shall retain natural design characteristics and be so designed that they do not present a hazard to life and safety or create erosion problems. 
                  6.  All drainage features shall be in accordance with standards and specifications of the director of public works, and no extension shall be made from the street drainage through the abutting property without approval of the director of public works. 
                  7.  When the construction of a proposed public road makes it necessary to cross a storm drain, the developer shall provide and install the required size and length of an acceptable grade of pipe. 
                  a.  In cases where the developer or subdivider chooses not to develop the land through which the drain runs, then the trench may be left open; provided, however, in such cases the plat must be so marked and an easement shown thereon, indicating that no building or driveway shall be built over or within 40 feet of the open drain. 
                  b.  Where the developer chooses to leave the drain open and same is crossed by a driveway, the size of pipe shall be determined by the director of public works and no building permit will be approved unless the installation meets the requirements of the director of public works. 
                  c.  Notwithstanding the above controls, the chief building official may refuse to issue a building permit on any lot or lots where the land is subject to floods. 
                  Section 903. - Water system. 
                  All water mains, where provided, shall be installed along with a service connection for each lot or land development and be in operating condition prior to final plat approval if required and paving installation. The water system shall be connected to the county water authority's water system unless another source approved by the county health department is accepted by the planning commission. All pipes, valves, and other components shall conform to county water authority and county health department regulations and specifications of the director of public works. 
                  An applicant may propose and the health department and planning commission may approve water supply to be served by a community water system. 
                  Section 904. - Fire hydrants. 
                  Fire hydrants shall be located no more than 1,000 feet apart. Hydrants, fittings, valves and fire department connections shall be approved by the fire department. Fire department connections shall be not less than 18 inches or more than 36 inches above the level of the adjoining ground or paving. The thread of such connections shall be uniform with that used by the fire department. To eliminate repavement of streets, all underground utilities for fire hydrants, together with the fire hydrants themselves, and all other supply improvements shall be installed before any final paving of a street within the right-of-way shared by such underground utilities. 
                  Section 905. - Sanitary sewerage system. 
                  When in the written opinion of the county health department, public sanitary sewers are within reasonable access of the subdivision or land development, the subdivider or land developer shall provide sanitary sewer services to each lot within the bounds of the subdivision, or to the land development. All street sewers serving lots in the subdivision shall be installed by the subdivider. 
                  When in the written opinion of the county health department, a public sanitary sewer is not accessible; an alternate method of sewage disposal for each lot or the land development may be used when in compliance with the standards of the county health department. If public sewerage is not available, but is expected to be available within a reasonable time period after completion of the subdivision or land development, an alternate method for sewage disposal for individual lots or the land development will be required on an interim basis. In this instance, unless otherwise determined by the planning commission, the developer will be required to construct a complete sanitary sewer system for the subdivision or land development, including outfall lines, street sewers, and service stubs to individual lots. All sewers will be plugged and otherwise protected to insure serviceability at the time of connection to the public system, and will conform to the specifications of the county water authority and the director of public works. 
                  Section 906. - Utilities. 
                  The electric system and any other underground utility system, when it is provided in a subdivision or land development, shall be installed along with service connections before any paving of streets. All utility facilities, including but not limited to electric power, telephone, and cable television, shall be located underground throughout the subdivision or land development. 
                  ARTICLE 10. - CONSERVATION SUBDIVISIONS 

                  Section 1001. - Purpose and intent. 
                  Within the Planned Development District (PD) of the Land Use Regulation of White County, conservation subdivision is a tool for land use development. It is a subdivision that concentrates buildings in specific areas on the development site to allow the remaining land to be used for common open space. The purpose of a conservation subdivision is to protect farmland and natural resources. This method of design normally allows the maximum number of dwelling units permitted under the current subdivision regulations. 
                  In conventional subdivisions, all the land is divided into residential lots and streets, with the only open space typically being un-buildable land such as wetlands, steep slopes, floodplains, and storm water management areas. In conservation subdivisions, the neighborhoods are more compact, with smaller lots. A higher percentage of the site is preserved as open space. 
                  Public concern has grown over the loss of open space and rural character that seems to accompany development. One of the main purposes for adopting conservation subdivision design is to preserve open space. 
                  This article is intended to provide for residential subdivisions that are designed based first and foremost on the preservation of open space, but that accommodate the full extent of development that would otherwise be legally possible under conventional subdivision designs, and that: 
                  a.  Minimize the environmental and visual impacts of new development on critical resources and historically, archeologically, and culturally significant sites and structures. 
                  b.  Contribute to an interconnected network of permanent open space in the community and provide for undivided or relatively undivided open spaces within new developments. 
                  c.  Create a greater diversity of living environments than is possible with conventional residential subdivision developments. 
                  d.  Foster informal social interaction among neighborhood residents in common open spaces. 
                  e.  Reduce the demand on public expenditures for open space, parkland, play fields, and other areas for active and passive recreation. 
                  f.  Encourage compact patterns that reduce capital costs by requiring less linear footage distances of roads and utilities than conventional subdivision development. 
                  g.  Offer greater opportunities to implement environmentally sensitive sewage treatment and disposal systems. 
                  h.  Encourage pedestrian/bicycle traffic throughout the development whenever possible. 
                  i.  Discourage non-local traffic through thoughtful road design. 
                  j.  Encourage vegetative buffers.

                  Open Space Conservation Subdivision 
                  (Res. No. 2017-02, 1-9-17) 
                  Section 1002. - Definitions. 
                  Best management practices: A collection of structural practices and vegetative measures which, when properly designed, installed and maintained, will provide effective erosion and sedimentation control. 
                  Conservation areas, primary: Any property qualifying as conservation use property under O.C.G.A. Section 48-5-7.4; and any steep slopes, floodplains, wetlands, water bodies, upland buffers around wetlands and water bodies, critical wildlife habitat, and sites of historic, cultural, or archaeological significance, located outside of building envelopes and lots established for building purposes. 
                  Conservation areas, secondary: Prime farmland, natural meadows, mature woodlands, farm fields, localized aquifer recharge areas, and lands containing scenic views and sites, located outside of building envelopes and lots established for building purposes. 
                  Conservation easement: A legally enforceable agreement between a property owner and the holder of the easement, with content meeting requirements of state law and in a form acceptable to the county attorney and recorded in the office of the clerk of superior court. A conservation easement restricts the existing and future use of the defined tract or lot to conservation use, agriculture, passive recreation, or other use approved by the county board of commissioners and prohibits further subdivision or development. Such agreement also provides for the maintenance of open spaces and any improvements on the tract or lot. Such agreement cannot be altered except with the express written permission of the easement holder and any other co-signers. A conservation easement may also establish other provisions and contain standards that safeguard the tract or lot's special resources from negative changes. 
                  Conservation subdivision: A subdivision, as defined by this Article, where open/green space or common area is the central organizing element of the subdivision design and that identifies and permanently protects all primary and all or some of the secondary conservation areas within the boundaries of the subdivision. 
                  Habitat for endangered or threatened species: An area verified by the state department of natural resources as:

                  Open space: Any combination of primary conservation areas and secondary conservation areas, as defined in this article, that together form a permanent, undivided or relatively undivided, undeveloped area. As much as 25 percent of the open space may be devoted to active recreational facilities, as defined. Easements for electric transmission lines or any other above-ground improvement shall not be considered open space except as may be otherwise provided by this article. 
                  Recreation, active: Leisure activities that are facility oriented, such as swimming pools, tennis courts, and ball fields. 
                  Recreation, passive: Leisure activities that are natural resource oriented, such as hiking trails, conservation areas, and nature preserves. 
                  Scenic views and sites: Those geographic areas containing visually significant or unique natural features, as identified in the county's comprehensive plan, or by other reasonable means. 
                  Sensitive natural areas: Any area, as identified now or hereafter by the state department of natural resources, which contains one or more of the following: habitat, including nesting sites, occupied by rare or endangered species; rare or exemplary natural communities; significant landforms, hydroforms, or geological features; or other areas so designated by the department of natural resources; and which is sensitive or vulnerable to physical or biological alteration. 
                  Section 1003. - Relationship to subdivision regulations. 
                  Conservation subdivisions shall be considered and processed in accordance with preliminary and final plat requirements as specified in this resolution, except that in addition the criteria for approval and grounds for disapproval as provided in this article shall also apply to decisions on preliminary plats. Conservation subdivisions shall meet the improvement requirements of this resolution. Where design considerations for lots and blocks are more specifically recommended in this article, they shall be considered applicable recommendations in lieu of those found in other articles of this resolution which would otherwise be applied. 
                  Section 1004. - Primary conservation areas. 
                  Primary conservation areas on lands in conventional subdivisions are permitted to be platted and included in adjacent residential lots. In contrast, a conservation subdivision incorporates, and shall include, all primary conservation areas into undivided or relatively undivided, permanent, open spaces. Primary conservation areas, as defined by this Article, include the following: habitats for endangered or threatened species, wetlands, groundwater recharge areas, flood plains, water bodies, shorelines, and adjacent riparian zones or upland buffers, historic, cultural, and archaeological sites, and steep slopes. 

                  Primary Conservation Areas 
                  Section 1005. - Secondary conservation areas. 
                  Secondary conservation areas on lands in conventional subdivisions are rarely identified and conserved. In contrast, a conservation subdivision identifies, and shall identify, secondary conservation areas and shall integrate all or a portion of them into undivided or relatively undivided, permanent, open spaces. 

                  Secondary Conservation Areas 
                  Section 1006. - Required open space specifications. 
                  a.  Minimum percent of site area. Each conservation subdivision shall provide a minimum of 40 percent of its total land area as open space, as defined by this article. Areas of above ground utility right-of-way and impervious surfaces must be excluded from the minimum. 
                  b.  Minimum size. The minimum amount of open space required to qualify for an open space conservation subdivision shall be 1.5 contiguous acres. The purpose of this minimum open space acreage is to avoid development proposals that provide only small, scattered open spaces that would not functionally contribute to the overall open space network of the surrounding area. 
                  c.  Permitted uses. In the case of farmland conversion, part of the open space within a conservation subdivision may be permitted to be retained in the hands of the original farmer/landowner or leased to a farmer for agricultural, pasture, or horticulture uses, so long as the activity is undertaken using best management practices to reduce environmental impacts to the extent possible. Open space may not be used for golf courses, roadways, or water impoundments. No more than ten percent of the open space may by used for active recreation spaces. Uses not expressly authorized via the preliminary plat review and approval process are prohibited. Impoundments may not exceed 50 percent of the open space. 
                  1.  Uses of open space may include the following: 
                  a.  Conservation of natural, archeological or historical resources; 
                  b.  Meadows, woodlands, wetlands, wildlife corridors, game preserves, or similar conservation-oriented areas; 
                  c.  Walking or bicycle trails, provided they are constructed of porous paving materials 
                  d.  Passive recreation areas (leisure activities that are facility orientated, such as swimming pools, tennis courts and ball fields); 
                  e.  Active recreation areas (leisure activities that are natural resource oriented, such as hiking trails, conservation areas, and nature preserves) provided that they are limited to no more than ten percent of the total open space and are not located within primary conservation areas. Active recreation areas may include impervious surfaces. Active recreation areas in excess of this limit must be located outside of the protected open space. 
                  f.  Agriculture, horticulture, silviculture or pasture uses, provided that all applicable best management practices are used to minimize environmental impacts, and such activities are not conducted within primary conservation areas; 
                  g.  Landscaped stormwater management facilities, community wastewater disposal systems and individual wastewater disposal systems located on soils particularly suited to such uses. Such facilities shall be located outside of primary conservation areas; 
                  h.  Easements for drainage, access, and underground utility lines; 
                  i.  Other conservation-oriented uses compatible with the purposes of this article. 
                  j.  Other appropriate uses that are compatible with the overall scale and character of the subdivision and that are specifically approved by the planning board. 
                  d.  Prohibited uses of open space. 
                  1.  Golf courses; 
                  2.  Roads, parking lots and impervious surfaces, except as specifically authorized in the previous sections; 
                  3.  Agricultural and forestry activities not conducted according to accepted best management practices; 
                  4.  Other activities as determined by the applicant and recorded on the legal instrument providing for permanent protection. 
                  e.  Open spaces shall be named. Each open space shall be given a name appropriate to its purpose and design. Acceptable identifying types of names for open spaces include but are not limited to "common," "park," "green," "meadow," "woods," "farm," and "historic site." 
                  Section 1007. - Conservation easement required. 
                  All primary conservation areas, and all secondary conservation areas shown on the preliminary plat and required or proposed to be retained as open space, shall be permanently protected from further subdivision, development, and unauthorized use by a conservation easement. A conservation easement, as defined, shall be approved by the county and 
                  (1)  Donated to a conservation organization or land trust; or 
                  (2)  Donated to a homeowners association; or 
                  (3)  Donated to the county if accepted by the county. 
                  In the case of farmland conversion, part of the open space within a conservation subdivision may be permitted to be retained in the hands of the original farmer/landowner if subject to a conservation easement meeting the requirements of this article. 
                  Sec. 1008. - Guidelines for drafting conservation easements. 
                  The following guidelines are offered for drafting conservation easements and may be required by the county board of commissioners: 
                  a.  The easement agreement recognizes and describes in a statement of purpose the special qualities of the property subject to the easement. The easement agreement must include a map of the tract noting all significant features within the area. The easement agreement clearly identifies the owner of the property subject to the easement agreement, the holder of the easement agreement, and the responsibilities of the property owner, easement agreement holder. 
                  b.  The easement agreement specifically and clearly identifies the boundaries of the property subject to the easement agreement, preferably by metes and bounds legal description and survey plat. 
                  c.  The easement agreement contains restrictions as to what the owner may do with the property and specifically delineates what may not be done with the property. Limitations shall include but may not be confined to prohibitions against subdivision, earthmoving, dumping, signs, utility lines, construction, changes to existing structures, and uses made of the property. 
                  d.  The easement agreement provides for the right of the easement holder and co-signer to inspect the property to assure observance of restrictions. It also provides for enforcement procedures. 
                  e.  The easement agreement provides for the maintenance of property. 
                  f.  The easement agreement contains provisions governing its amendment, including provisions that the easement agreement shall not be altered except with the express written permission of the easement holder, property owner, and any co-signers. 
                  Section 1009. - Homeowners association. 
                  Open spaces may be owned and managed in common by a homeowners association, subject to compliance with the provisions of this article and the following requirements: 
                  a.  The developer of the conservation subdivision shall provide to the administrative official for approval, prior to the approval of a preliminary plat, a description of the homeowners association, including bylaws and methods for maintaining open space. The developer of the open space conservation subdivision shall provide a property management plan or an estimate of the costs and staff requirements for the maintenance, operation, and insurance of the open space and any facilities it includes in the description of methods for maintaining the subdivision's open space. 
                  b.  The homeowners association shall be established by the conservation subdivision developer prior to the approval of a final plat on the property involving a conservation subdivision. 
                  c.  Homeowners association membership of each non-open space lot owner in the open space conservation subdivision shall be mandatory (required) and automatic. 
                  d.  Unless maintenance is assigned to a conservation organization or land trust, the homeowners association shall be responsible for maintenance, insurance, and taxes on the open space within the open space conservation subdivision. In such cases, the association shall be required to assess dues for the maintenance of open space, purchase of insurance, and payment of taxes, unless another income source is proven to be available. Members of the association shall share the costs of open space maintenance as indicated in bylaws/covenants. The association shall be empowered with the legal ability to place liens on non-open space lot owners for failure to pay association dues. 
                  Section 1010. - Application. 
                  As a part of the preliminary plat application, the applicant for a conservation subdivision shall in addition to the requirements for preliminary plats specified in this resolution, submit an analysis of existing features on the site, which shall at minimum include the following: 
                  a.  Significant wildlife habitats, if any. If information on habitats is not available, the wildlife potential of various soil types on the site shall be identified and examined.

                  Section 1011. - Consideration. 
                  Approval or denial of a preliminary plat for a conservation subdivision shall, in addition to criteria specified elsewhere in this resolution for consideration of preliminary plats, be based on the extent to which the plat meets the following criteria: 
                  a.  All primary conservation areas are protected as permanent open space. 
                  b.  A sufficient amount of secondary conservation areas are protected as permanent open space, as opposed to being devoted to lots and other uses. 
                  c.  The configuration of the open space tract is contiguous and undivided, or open space is provided in relatively undivided tracts that cannot reasonably be reconfigured into one contiguous, undivided tract. 
                  d.  Each conservation subdivision shall provide a minimum of 40 percent of its total land area as open space, as defined by this article. 
                  e.  The conservation subdivision meets the regulations specified in this article. 
                  Section 1012. - Justifiable grounds for denial. 
                  Reasons for the denial of a preliminary plat of a conservation subdivision include but are not limited to the following: 
                  a.  The application fails to fully identify primary and secondary conservation areas. 
                  b.  The proposed method of sewage treatment is inappropriate for the site or found to be potentially dangerous to public heath. 
                  c.  One or more of the lots within the conservation subdivision are too small to be in character with residences on adjoining or nearby properties. 
                  d.  One or more of the lots are significantly large or wide, such that their design contributes to an unnecessary decrease in the amount of open space retained on site. 
                  e.  The street configuration does not provide for connectivity, or preserve natural features, or it is found to be inconsistent with the open space character of the subject property and its surroundings. 
                  f.  The proposed open space network is divided, not functional, inconsistent with open space plans of the county, or does not provide for the protection of the most valuable secondary conservation areas on the site given the natural and scenic properties inherent on the site. 
                  g.  The proposed open space network fails to maximize the length of the common boundary between conservation areas on site and conservation areas or parkland abutting the open space conservation subdivision site

                  RESOLUTION NO. 2007-40 
                  A RESOLUTION TO AMEND THE OFFICIAL CODE OF WHITE COUNTY, GEORGIA, SUBDIVSIONS 
                  WHEREAS, the county board of commissioners wishes to revise a portion of the Official Code of White County as it relates to subdivision of land in the unincorporated areas of White County; and 
                  WHEREAS, the county commissioners and citizens of White County desire the harmonious, orderly and progressive development of land within White County in accordance with and in order to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
                  NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the County Commissioners of White County and it is hereby resolved by authority of the same that the regulations be revised as follows: 
                  Footnotes: 
                  --- (1) --- 
                  Editor's note— Printed herein are the minor subdivision regulations of the county, as adopted by Res. Number 2007-40, adopted December 4, 2007.

                  ARTICLE 1. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

                  Section 101. - Short title. 
                  This resolution is known and may be cited as the "Minor Subdivision and Land Development Regulations of White County, Georgia." 
                  Section 102. - Purpose and intent. 
                  Minor subdivisions provide certain advantages that tend to favor their use over the filing of major subdivision applications. Said advantages include a shorter application period and approval process, less public scrutiny, and less rigorous requirements for access to one of the lots in a minor subdivision. Given these advantages, the prospect exists that subdividers may seek to divide a parcel via consecutive and/or contiguous minor subdivisions instead of filing a major subdivision. It is the intent of the board of commissioners to prohibit the practice of "chain" subdivisions where the same landowner subdivides land and then files minor subdivision applications on common contiguous parcels, which collectively total nine or more lots. It is also the intent of the board of commissioners to prohibit minor subdivision adjacent to each other within a five-year time period, in cases where part of an original tract of land is now owned by another person or entity and was transferred or sold to another owner with the apparent intent to circumvent the major subdivision process. 
                  Section 103. - Authority. 
                  This resolution is adopted pursuant to powers vested in counties by the state constitution, home rule powers, and state administrative rules for the adoption and implementation of comprehensive plans and the protection of vital areas of the state.

                  ARTICLE IX. - AGRICULTURE FORESTRY DISTRICT, A-1 
                  The White County Board of Commissioners recognize the tremendous value that our farming and agricultural communities have and will continue to be in the coming years. That is why it is duly noted that agricultural and farming properties are grandfathered in that as long as the property maintains its purpose as of the date of this document, the operation of it shall not be impeded by this appendix. Agricultural land may be subdivided for family estate purposes and shall continue to exist as such for the heirs of the property. 

                  Section 900. - Purpose and intent. 
                  Located in White County are several areas which contain soils highly suitable for the cultivation and operation of agricultural activities. These areas of prime agricultural lands are located in several communities throughout the county. 
                  Land designated for the Agriculture Forestry Protection Land Use District constitutes a valuable natural resource whose protection is in the public interest. Agriculture is a major component of White County's economy, and it remains a viable economic enterprise in that land is held in relatively large tracts and land values are sufficiently low to support exclusively agricultural uses. 
                  The White County Board of Commissioners realize that there are times where capital is required to continue operations related to agricultural purposes, therefore, the board authorizes the subdividing of said classified properties for the benefit of the farming operations. The purchaser of said subdivision may request that this property be reclassified if he or she wishes. The continuation of agriculture as a viable land use and component of the location economy is threatened by suburban and urban development land subdivision and land uses. When land is subdivided into smaller tracts, it becomes less suitable for agriculture because the assembly of enough acreage for a farm of minimum efficient size becomes difficult. Smaller tracts generally sell for a higher price per acre, and subdivision of large agricultural tracts generally results in the increase of per-acre land values. The availability of smaller tracts at lower costs attracts suburban and non-farm buyers into the market, thereby increasing adjacent land values for residential uses and decreasing land values for agricultural uses. The cumulative impact of the subdivision of farm land into small lots increases the level of conflict between farmers and non-farmers, makes farming more difficult, and eventually leads to dissolution of the agricultural economy. 
                  Forestry has been an important industry for White County for many decades. In regards [to] complete removal of trees from a property, White County will encourage replanting of this renewable resource. We want to see continued green space so that we are not only good stewards of the lands entrusted to us but it also provides cleaner air and a healthier environment for us to raise our children. 
                  Therefore, pursuant to the many goals, objectives, policies and recommendations of the comprehensive plan for White County, an Agriculture Forestry Land Use District is hereby established with the purposes of maintaining the agricultural land resources in a form amenable to the continuation of agriculture, restricting the division of farmland so that it does not become broken up into small parcels, thereby avoiding the accelerated conversion of land residential uses and discouraging the shift of the land market from rural to suburban/urban. An additional purpose of this land use district is [to] keep open enough land so that agriculture remains functionally viable, through the application of use restrictions which promote the preservation of prime agricultural lands. While the intent of this district is to promote maximum use of such areas for crop cultivation, the district regulations permit other active agricultural uses. Another purpose of this district is to hereby establish and promote the best use of forested land and to discourage and manage the division and development of forest land through use restrictions and various development requirements. This district may, in some very limited cases, serve as a transition from intensive agricultural operations to extremely low residential uses. 
                  This district also includes a number of businesses and establishments uses that require a special use permit (SUP) from the White County Commission. Uses requiring special use permits are those that would not be appropriate without restrictions and is not permitted by right or conditionally, but allowed through regulations as to the number, area, location, relation to neighborhoods, operations or other pertinent considerations and specification/criteria as specified in this Code.

                  ARTICLE X. - RESIDENTIAL, SINGLE-FAMILY DISTRICT, R-1 

                  Section 1000. - Purpose and intent. 
                  Within White County are areas that have been subdivided, or can be subdivided, for residential development in a variety of development settings based on the carrying capacity of the land and the infrastructure available in the area. These areas range from being rural in character to more suburban settings. It is the intent of the Residential Single-Family District to provide suitable areas where the development of residential subdivision has occurred or is taking place. Furthermore, the White County Comprehensive Plan supports the maintenance of the rural character of the county and recommends the application [of] extremely low density restrictions to discourage the subdivision of land in these areas. These parts of the county are those that lie within agricultural areas and may also display traditional historic elements within the fabric of the community setting. The White County Comprehensive Plan also recognizes the need for establishing residential areas where public infrastructure and related services are available, or in close proximity, are adjacent to compatible uses and can be developed in an economically efficient manner. 
                  These areas are intended to establish and preserve quiet, stable and affordable single-family neighborhoods at low to medium densities, free from other land uses, except those which are compatible with and convenient to the residents of such district.

Many of these housing units are second homes or vacation homes that are placed in vacation cabin rental programs. Additionally, there are rental cabin resorts located primarily in the northern sections of White County. Other types of seasonal housing include the placement of park model recreation vehicles that are employed primarily by visitors and vacationers during the summer and fall seasons in recreation vehicle (RV) park developments and resorts. Campgrounds and outdoor recreation camps and retreats also house visitors temporarily in White County throughout the tourist season. 
                  The purpose and intent of the Seasonal Residential (SR) land use classification is to establish an area to provide housing and service needs of vacationers and seasonal residents or others. The land uses in this land use classification must also meet additional development requirements found in the White County Code for their respective type of development.

                  ARTICLE XVI. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT, (PD) 

                  Section 1600. - Purpose and intent. 
                  It is the purpose of the Planned Development District (PD) to provide and encourage a voluntary alternative to the strict segregation of lot and property uses contained in the other districts in this resolution. The rural portions of White County are very important to the overall scenic, open space and agricultural character of the county. Typical practices of platting subdivisions and strip commercial centers create sprawling development land out with little regard for natural, agricultural, scenic and historic resources, with very little variety in design and density, and with little open space accessible to nearby property owners or the public. The Planned Development District is a flexible alternative approach which encourages the grouping of buildings and lots on a small portion of the tract where the developer can maintain the same residential, but offer smaller lots with the remaining land dedicated or reserved for open space, agriculture or recreation. The land within an approved planned development is intended to be planned and developed by a single developer or group as a single, entire unit of land. Land within a Planned Unit Development District shall not be subdivided and sold to others prior to completion of the installation of required improvements. 
                  It is the intent of the Planned Development District to provide maximum flexibility with regard to the mixture of land uses. Within a Planned Development District, any land use, may be permitted if such use or uses can be shown to provide an orderly relation and function to other uses in the development and to existing land uses, as well as with due regard to the comprehensive plan. The permitted use or uses of property located in the planned development shall be determined at the time the land use district and development plan is approved, and development within the district shall be limited to those uses specifically requested as part of the application and approved by the board of commissioners, unless otherwise specifically noted in the board's approval of the Planned Development Land Use District. 
                  This district is to be utilized as a "floating zone" which shall mean that areas will not be pre-designated as Planned Development Districts but rather each such designation shall result from a specific and separate application for amendment. Planned Development Districts are separate land use districts and shall follow the same amendment procedures as other districts. Unless otherwise stated in this section, the development standards and the land uses which are presented with the application for amendment shall, if approved, become the standards for the subject property and shall become a part of the land use regulations. 
                  A Planned Development District must contain a minimum area of 20 contiguous acres, a minimum lot width of 500 feet and must have a minimum of 100 feet of frontage on a public street, which shall provide access to such public street.

                  Section 1601. - Permitted uses. 
                  1.  Any use permitted in a residential district. 
                  2.  Commercial, office, public, semi-public and industrial uses serving the residents of the development, not to exceed 40 percent of the total land area of the development. 
                  3.  Agricultural, forestry and recreation uses established for open space, green space and amenities serving the development and surrounding community.

                  Section 1602. - Letter of intent and development agreement. 
                  Applications for land use to a Planned Development District shall require a letter of intent from the developer, which shall contain a report that explains the intent, type, nature, size and characteristics of the proposed development. The letter shall contain data stating the total number of acres (or square feet) proposed for each type of land use, including public facilities, within the proposed development. In addition, the letter of intent should provide a clear explanation of why the proposed development standards are necessary if the above proposed standards vary from existing standards in the land use regulations. 
                  A development agreement is a negotiated agreement between the county and a developer. It shall include how the development will be phased and constructed over an extended period of time. The development agreement shall bring certainty and flexibility of requirements that will govern the development over the established time. In reciprocating to "lock in" the current and negotiated development requirements for the development over the established time period, the county shall receive agreement from the developer to install infrastructure or take other agreed upon actions that further the public interest.

                  Section 1603. - Site plan approval. 
                  Applications for a Planned Development District shall require a site plan. Site plans shall be prepared by a professional engineer or architect and include the stamp or seal of registration and initials on the plan. 
                  All site plans required by this section, shall at a minimum, contain the following information:

                  9.  Name, address, and phone number of owner of record. 
                  10.  Name, address, and phone number of preparer of plan. 
                  11.  Date of plan drawing and revision date(s) if any. 
                  12.  Existing buildings and structures on or encroaching on the tract. 
                  13.  Proposed buildings, structures, common/green space and amenity areas on the tract. 
                  14.  Existing streets, utilities, and utility easements on and adjacent to the tract. 
                  15.  Proposed streets, utilities, fire and life safety infrastructure and easements on and adjacent to the tract. 
                  16.  Environmental conditions (streams, wetlands, watersheds, groundwater recharge areas, flood hazard areas, river corridor protection boundaries, mountain and hillside protection areas, etc.). 
                  17.  Right-of-way widths and pavement widths for abutting streets and existing and proposed streets.

                  Section 1604. - Recommendations for design. 
                  The following specifications are not regulations, but recommended guidelines to be utilized: 
                  1.  Unless topographical or other barriers protect the privacy of existing adjoining uses, structures or buildings located at the perimeter of the planned unit development should be setback a distance of at least 100 feet to protect the privacy and amenities of adjacent, existing uses. 
                  2.  Structures or buildings located at the perimeter of the development should be permanently screened in a manner that sufficiently protects the privacy and amenities of the adjacent, existing uses. 
                  3.  Uses should be predominantly residential in accordance with the use recommendations of the comprehensive plan. 
                  4.  Where appropriate, the planned development should provide for more than just one type of dwelling unit, such as townhouses, duplexes, and multi-family dwellings. 
                  5.  Multi-family dwellings should not comprise more than 25 percent of the total dwelling units within the proposed development. 
                  6.  Sites for churches, schools, community or club buildings, and similar civic or semi-public facilities are encouraged to be provided, where appropriate. 
                  7.  Commercial and offices uses, if proposed, should be located in careful relation to other land uses within and outside of the development; they should be scaled so that they primarily serve the occupants of the planned development; they should be designed and oriented to face the interior of the planned development rather than oriented toward passer-by traffic exterior to the planned development. In residential districts, the amount of land in a planned development devoted to commercial and office uses should not exceed 15 percent of the unit of land within the planned development unless it can be shown that a greater percentage of land devoted to such uses is more conducive to the mix of uses. 
                  8.  Industrial uses are not typically considered to be appropriate for inclusion within planned developments; however, such uses are not prohibited and may be proposed and approved in larger (e.g., 50 acres or more) planned developments where living and working areas need to be proximate to one another, subject to separation and screening requirements to avoid nuisances. 
                  9.  Common space, open space, green space and amenity areas should be presented along with ownership agreements and maintenance programs for stormwater management facilities.

                  Section 1605. - Revisions to the approved planned development application. 
                  Any additions in the types of land uses, increases in the square footage or density, decreases in lot sizes, changes in the location or dimension of streets, decreases in dwelling unit floor areas, increases in non-residential floor areas, major alteration in the land use patterns, or other substantial changes in common space, or amenities which result in a development of such intent and character which has not been conceptually approved by the governing body shall require additional approval in accordance with the procedures established in this resolution and may require amendment of the development agreement. Otherwise, minor changes may be approved by the county planning department prior to issuance of building permits.

                  ARTICLE XVII. - SPECIAL USE PERMITS AND CONDITIONAL USES 

                  Section 1700. - Special use permits. 
                  The special use permit is designed to be used when: 
                  (a)  A special use listed under the land use district is desired would not be appropriate without restrictions and is not permitted by right or conditionally, but allowed through regulations as to the number, area, location, relation to neighborhoods, operations or other pertinent considerations and specification/criteria as specified in this Code; or 
                  (b)  A unique use not addressed in any land use district is desired for development and is not likely to be duplicated within White County. 
                  In order to accommodate these special uses, the special use permit allows the board of commissioners to approve a special use on a particular lot or tract without changing the general land use district. Such approval shall be subject to the requirements set forth below and any additional conditions deemed necessary to ensure the compatibility or reduce conflict of the special use with the surrounding properties. All special use permit applications shall be for firm development proposals only. The special use permit shall not be used for securing early land use for conceptual proposals which may not be undertaken for some time. A special use permit application shall be considered only if it is made by the owner of the property or his/her authorized agent. The minimum requirements for a special use permit are: 
                  (1)  Any uses permitted under a special use permit shall also conform to the requirements of this resolution and the development regulations for the use as found in the land use district. 
                  (2)  Special use permits shall be considered and issued within only those designated districts of this appendix. 
                  (3)  The application and review process for a special use permit shall be the same as for the land use district under which the special use is found. In addition to the information and/or site plans which are required to be submitted for the proposed development, additional information deemed necessary by the director in order to evaluate a proposed use and its relationship to the surrounding area shall be submitted. In the review process, particular emphasis shall be given to the evaluation of the characteristics of the proposed use in relationship to its immediate neighborhood and the compatibility or conflict of the proposed use with its neighborhood. 
                  (4)  In the approval process for a special use permit application, the board of commissioners shall consider the policies and objectives of the comprehensive plan, particularly in relationship to the proposed site and surrounding area, and shall consider the potential adverse impacts on the surrounding area, especially with regard to but not limited to traffic, storm drainage, land values and compatibility of land use activities. 
                  (5)  If an application is approved and a special use permit is granted, all conditions which may have been attached to the approval are binding on the property. All subsequent development and use of the property shall be in accordance with the approved plan and conditions. Once established, the special use shall be in continuous operation. Upon discovery that the operation of the special use has or had ceased for a period of 90 days or more and the owner of the property has not requested voluntary termination of the special use permit, the director shall forward a report to the board of commissioners through the planning commission which may recommend that action be taken to remove the special use permit from the property. 
                  (6)  Changes to a special use or development of a site for the special use shall be treated as an amendment to the special use permit and shall be subject to the same application and review process as a new application. 
                  (7)  The special use for which a special use permit is granted shall commence operations or construction within 12 months of the date of approval by the board of commissioners. If, at the end of this 12-month period, the director determines that active efforts are not proceeding toward operation or construction, a report may be forwarded to the board of commissioners through the planning commission which may recommend that action be taken to remove the special use permit from the property. 
                  (8)  An application for a special use permit in a residential district and which use is proposed to operate in a dwelling or as an accessory use to a dwelling is subject to the following additional requirements: 
                  a.  The special use permit shall be valid for no more than a two-year period. Upon or before the expiration of a special use permit, the owner shall make application to continue the special use permit if continuance is desired. However, after the first two-year period the board of commissioners may waive the two-year time limitation with the concurrence of the planning commission. 
                  b.  The special use shall operate within the dwelling on the property or, if approved by the board of commissioners, in an accessory structure. 
                  c.  The exterior character of the dwelling shall be preserved in its residential state and there shall be no outside evidence of the operation of the special use to the neighborhood, except for any accessory structure approved by the board of commissioners. 
                  d.  The owner of the property shall occupy the property and shall operate any business associated with the special use. 
                  e.  The owner of the property shall submit with the application a signed statement in which he/she agrees that the special use permit, if approved, shall automatically terminate in the event that the property is sold, transferred or otherwise conveyed to any other party, or the business which operates the special use is sold, transferred, otherwise conveyed or discontinued. The owner shall also agree to notify the director in writing upon the occurrence of any of these events. 
                  f.  In addition to the information and/or site plans required by this section, the owner of the property shall submit with the application for a special use permit information regarding the ownership of any business associated with the use, the experience and background qualifications related to the operation of said business, prior similar businesses operated, applicable State of Georgia certifications, licenses and like information. 
                  (9)  The owner of the property approved for a special use may voluntarily request termination of the special use permit by notifying the director in writing. The director shall notify the board of commissioners through the planning commission of the voluntary terminations as they occur and shall change the official land use maps to reflect any voluntary terminations. The approval of a special use permit for a specific use which may be operated by a lessee under a private agreement with a lessor in any non-residential district shall not obligate the board of commissioners to be responsible for or be required to resolve any disputes which may arise out of the voluntary termination of the special use permit by the property owner. 
                  (10)  The planning department shall have the right to periodically examine the operation of the specific use to determine compliance with the requirements of any conditions. If the director determines that the requirements and conditions are being violated, a written notice shall be issued to the owner of the property outlining the nature of the violations and giving the owner of the property a maximum of ten days to come into compliance. If after ten days the violations continue to exist, the director shall forward a report to the board of commissioners through the planning commission, which may recommend that action be taken to remove the special use permit from the property. 
                  (11)  Upon approval by the board of commissioners, a special use permit shall be identified on the official land use maps. 
                  (12)  Upon approval by the board of commissioners of a special use permit, the owner of the property shall be issued a notice from the director, which states the specific use permitted, the requirements of this section and any conditions attached to the approval. 
                  (13)  The building department shall not issue a certificate of occupancy for the specific use unless all requirements and conditions of the special use permit have been fulfilled by the owner of the property.

                  In adopting an amendment to the land use map, or approving a special use permit, the board of commissioners may impose special conditions which it deems necessary in order to make the requested action acceptable and consistent with the purposes of the district(s) involved and to further the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan. Such conditions may consist of, but are not limited to: setback requirements from any lot line; specified or prohibited locations for buildings, parking, loading or storage areas or other land uses; driveway curb cut restrictions; restrictions as to what land uses or activities shall be permitted; maximum building heights or other dimensions; special drainage or erosion provisions; landscaping or planted area, which may include the location, type and maintenance of plant materials; fences, walls, berms, or other buffering provisions or protective measures; preservation of existing trees or other vegetation; special measures to alleviate undesirable views, light, glare, noise, dust or odor; permitted hours of operation; architectural style; a requirement that the existing building(s) be retained; a requirement that developers must build according to the site plans as adopted; a limitation on exterior modifications of existing buildings; or any other requirement that the board of commissioners may deem appropriate and necessary as a condition of reclassification of use or issuance of a variance or special use permit. 
                  Such conditions: 
                  (1)  Shall only be valid if they are included in the motion approving the amendment for adoption; 
                  (2)  Shall be in effect for the period of time specified in the amendment; 
                  (3)  Shall be required of the property owner and all subsequent owners as a condition of their use of the property; 
                  (4)  Shall be interpreted and continuously enforced by the development director in the same manner as any other provision of this resolution; and 
                  (5)  A building permit shall not be issued until after the presentation and approval by the planning commission and/or the board of commissioners of final site, architecture and development plans required by such conditions.

The procedures for granting such permits shall be the same as for amendments to the zoning ordinance or zoning map. 
                  2.  Those conditions specified in this appendix shall be considered to be the minimum standards which must be met before the conditional use application may be considered by the planning commission for review and recommendation and the board of commissioners for decision. In deciding upon whether or not a conditional use meets the minimum standards and promotes the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the county, the board of commissioners shall utilize the applicable standards of review set forth in this appendix. 
                  3.  If the board of commissioners, after applying the evidence to the standards of review and conditions, have been convinced that the allowance of the conditional use will promote the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the county, a conditional use permit may be granted, subject to those provisions that may be imposed by the board of commissioners.

In doing so, they will consider one or more of the following factors, in addition to other factors and criteria set forth in this appendix, as they may be relevant to the application: 
                  (1)  The existing land use pattern; 
                  (2)  The possible creation of an isolated district unrelated to adjacent and nearby districts; 
                  (3)  The population density pattern and possible increase or overtaxing of the load on public facilities including, but not limited to, schools, utilities, and streets; 
                  (4)  The cost of the county and other governmental entities in providing, improving, increasing or maintaining public utilities, schools, streets and other public safety measures; 
                  (5)  The possible impact on the environment, including, but not limited to, drainage, soil erosion and sedimentation, flooding, air quality and water quantity; 
                  (6)  Whether the proposed zoning map amendment will be a deterrent to the value or improvement of development of adjacent property in accordance with existing regulations; 
                  (7)  Whether there are substantial reasons why the property cannot be used in accordance with existing regulations; 
                  (8)  The aesthetic effect of existing and future use of the property as it relates to the surrounding area; 
                  (9)  The extent to which the proposed zoning map amendment is consistent with the land use plan; 
                  (10)  The possible effects of the proposed zoning map amendment on the character of a zoning district, a particular piece of property, neighborhood, a particular area, or the community; 
                  (11)  The relation that the proposed zoning map amendment bears to the purpose of the overall zoning scheme, with due consideration given to whether or not the proposed change will help carry out the purposes of these zoning regulations; 
                  (12)  Applications for a zoning map amendment which do not contain specific site plans carry a rebuttable presumption that such rezoning shall adversely affect the zoning scheme; 
                  (13)  The consideration of the preservation of the integrity of residential neighborhoods shall be considered to carry great weight; 
                  (14)  In those instances in which property fronts on a major thoroughfare and also adjoins an established residential neighborhood, the factor of preservation of the residential area shall be considered to carry great weight. 
                  After reviewing evidence, the board of commissioners shall apply the evidence to the standards of review in making their decision. It will not be required that the board of commissioners consider every criteria contained in the standards of review. It shall be the duty of the applicant to carry the burden of proof that the proposed zoning map amendment promotes the public health, safety, morality or general welfare. 
                  If the board of commissioners determine that the applicant has shown that the proposed zoning map amendment promotes the health, safety, morals and general welfare under the standards of review, then the application shall be granted, subject to those reasonable provisions as may be imposed by board of commissioners as provided in this appendix. Otherwise, such application shall be denied. 
                  In ruling on any petition in which the petitioner has brought a challenge of the existing zoning classification, the board of commissioners may impose upon such property any appropriate zoning classification, which might be consistent with the considerations contained above.

                  ARTICLE XX. - VARIANCES 

                  Section 2000. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of a variance is to provide relief when a strict application of the district requirements would impose unusual practical difficulties or unnecessary physical hardships on the applicant. Practical difficulties and unnecessary hardships may result from the size, shape, or dimensions of a site or the location of existing structures thereon; from geographic, topographic, or other conditions on the site or in the immediate vicinity. No variance shall be granted to allow the use of property for a purpose not authorized within the district in which the proposed use would be located. A variance cannot be self-created. A variance should be granted only after evidence is presented and accepted that enforcement of all of the required standards on the property in question would render the property useless. This article establishes conditions; criteria for granting variances; public hearings on proposed variances; variances to road requirements; variance procedures; compliance with conditions of approval; vested interest in approved variances; investigations and reports; revocation; limitations on re-applications; and use variance.

                  Section 2001. - Conditions. 
                  (a)  Reasonable conditions may be imposed in connection with a variance as deemed necessary to protect the best interests of the surrounding property or neighborhood, and otherwise secure the purpose and requirements of this article. Guarantees and evidence may be required that such conditions will be and are being complied with. Such conditions may consist of, but are not limited to: setback requirements from any lot line; specified or prohibited locations for buildings, parking, loading or storage areas or other land uses; driveway curb cut restrictions; restrictions as to what land uses or activities shall be permitted; maximum building heights or other dimensions; special drainage or erosion provisions; landscaping or planted area, which may include the location, type and maintenance of plant materials; fences, walls, berms, or other buffering provisions or protective measures; preservation of existing trees or other vegetation; special measures to alleviate undesirable views, light, glare, noise, dust or odor; permitted hours of operation; architectural style; a requirement that the existing building(s) be retained; a requirement that developers must build according to the site plans as adopted; a limitation on exterior modifications of existing buildings; or any other requirement that the board of commissioners may deem appropriate and necessary as a condition of reclassification of use or issuance of a variance or special use permit. 
                  (b)  The planning commission is responsible for considering and making recommendations on applications for variances. Variances apply only to the land use standards and requirements specified for each district. They do not apply to other provisions of this chapter. 
                  (c)  The variance must specify which development standards and requirements are to be varied from. It must specify alternative standards and requirements to be met, replacing those varied from.

                  Section 2002. - Criteria for granting variances. 
                  Variances to standards and requirements of this chapter, with respect to open area, setbacks, yard area, lot coverage, height of structures, vision clearance, and other quantitative requirements may be granted only if, on the basis of the application, investigation, and evidence submitted by the applicant, all four expressly written findings below are made: 
                  (1)  That a strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of the specified standard or requirement would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship; and 
                  (2)  That there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applicable to the property involved or to the intended use of the property which do not apply generally to other properties in the same district; and 
                  (3)  That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare or materially injurious to properties or improvements in the near vicinity; and 
                  (4)  That the granting of the variance would support general objectives contained within this chapter. 
                  Variances in accordance with this article should not ordinarily be granted if the special circumstances on which the applicant relies are a result of the actions of the applicant or owner or previous owners.

Their recommendations shall be in writing and shall include written findings on each of the applicable criteria. If the planning commission fails to take action within 30 days after the public hearing, the request shall be deemed to have been approved. 
                  (c)  Decision on variance requests shall be the responsibility of the planning commission and shall become final after an elapsed period of 30 days from the date of decision. 
                  (d)  The planning commission's decision, with findings, shall be sent by mail to the applicant within five working days of the date of action. 
                  (e)  From time to time the planning commission may find it necessary to require a variance request to also meet approval of the White County Board of Commissioners. In doing so the variance request must follow the public hearing procedures prescribed in this resolution. 
                  (f)  An application of a variance which is not acted upon by the county commissioner within 90 days from the receipt of application may be deemed denied.

                  The director of community and economic development shall have the power to grant variances (except for density and use) from the development standards of this chapter if the intent of the appendix can be achieved and equal performance obtained by granting a variance. 
                  (1)  Authority. The authority to grant variances in accord with this section shall be limited to variances from the following requirements:

                  d.  Building height: A variance may be granted up to, but not exceeding, ten feet if such variance does not allow space habitable by humans and is also approved by the fire marshal and would not result in an increase in the number of stories that would otherwise be allowed by the land use district; 
                  e.  Buffers: The dimensions of a landscaping buffer required by this chapter if the intent of the required buffer can be equally achieved; however, no buffer required as a condition of land use shall be modified;

                  g.  Home occupations: If the intended use is clearly allowed pursuant to the definition of "Home occupation," then an administrative variance may be granted to conduct such business.

                  (3)  Basis for approval. The following criteria shall be considered by the director before allowing an administrative variance. No variance may be granted administratively for an application for a variance that has been heard by the planning commission within one year or if the application is for the expansion of a non-conforming use or structure. 
                  a.  The variance neither interferes with the rights of others as provided in this chapter nor is injurious to the public health, safety, and general welfare; 
                  b.  A strict interpretation and enforcement of the standards or requirement would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship; 
                  c.  No exceptional or extraordinary circumstances applicable to the subject property exist that do not generally apply to other properties in the same district; 
                  d.  The variance provides for reasonable use under the specified circumstances of each application;

                  g.  The variance does not exceed the scope of the authority set forth in subsection (1) of this section. 
                  (4)  Conditions of approval. The director of community and economic development may impose reasonable conditions upon any administrative variance to ensure that the public health, safety, and general welfare are protected. A violation of any imposed condition shall be a violation of this section. 
                  (5)  Administration. After all requirements for a variance application in accord with the terms hereof are received, the planning and development department shall review and certify that all required information is complete and that the request is within the limits of consideration set forth in subsection (1) of this section. The applicant shall then be advised to proceed with public notice in accord with subsection (2) of this section. After required notice has been provided and the time period for response has passed, the planning director shall have ten business days to render a decision. Notice of the decision shall be provided to the applicant by mailing such decision within five business days of the decision. Notice of the action taken by the director shall be provided to the planning commission of White County and shall be placed as an item of old business for no further action upon the agenda of the planning commission within 31 days. 
                  (6)  Compliance with other county codes. The effect of an administrative variance approval shall be that a specific request is determined to be appropriate for a specific location. The administrative variance application shall not approve a site plan nor waive or modify any other requirements of any other county code other than as specifically granted pursuant to the variance. 
                  (7)  Appeal. The applicant or an adjoining property owner may appeal to the county commission the decision of the director regarding an administrative variance within ten days of the decision via written objection and appeal.
