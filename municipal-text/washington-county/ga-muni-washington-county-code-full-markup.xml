PREFACE

         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of Washington County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were ordinances adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been provided catchlines to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Daniel Walker, Code Attorney, and D. J. Heath, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
                  The publisher is most grateful to Chris Hutchings, County Administrator/Clerk, for his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.

               Editor's note— This is not an exhaustive publication of all legislative acts and resolutions pertaining to Washington County. However, the provisions concerning the board of commissioners are comprehensive and current. This information is presented unofficially, strictly for information; the official published acts of the Georgia legislature are definitive and controlling. 
               
               ARTICLE I. - BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS[2] 
               
               Footnotes: 
               --- (2) --- 
               Editor's note— Printed herein is 1913 Ga. Laws (Law No. 271), page 452, establishing the county board of commissioners, as later amended. The absence of a subsequent history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original Act. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. Enactment, severability, repealer, transitional, ratification, publication and effective date provisions have been omitted, and where a section has been amended or repealed by a later provision, only the current effective language has been printed. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. 
               
               Sec. 1. - [Board as governing authority.] 
               The governing authority of Washington County shall be the board of commissioners of Washington County, sometimes referred to in this Act as the "board." From January 1, 1986, until December 31, 1986, that board shall consist of three members elected pursuant to the prior provisions of this Act. On and after January 1, 1987, that board shall consist of a chairman and four additional members, which four members shall be elected from commissioner districts described in section 2 of this Act. 
               (1985 Ga. Laws (No. 489), page 4882) 
               Sec. 2. - [Commission districts.] 
               (a)  For purposes of electing the members of the board, other than the chairman, Washington County is divided into four commissioner districts which shall be and correspond to those four numbered districts described in and attached to and made a part of this Act and further identified as Plan Name: washccsb2 Plan Type: Local User: Gina Administrator: Washington Co[unty]. 
               (b)  When used in such attachment, the terms "tract" and "BG" (block group) shall mean and describe the same geographical boundaries as provided in the report of the Bureau of the Census for the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. The separate numeric designations in a tract description which are underneath a BG heading shall mean and describe individual blocks within a block group as provided in the report of the Bureau of the Census for the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. Any part of Washington County which is not included in any such district described in that attachment shall be included within that district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. Any part of Washington County which is described in that attachment as being in a particular district shall nevertheless not be included within such district if such part is not contiguous to such district. Such noncontiguous part shall instead be included within that district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. Except as otherwise provided in the description of any district, whenever the description of such district refers to a named city, it shall mean the geographical boundaries of that city as shown on the census map for the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia.

                  (4)  Change the term "this ordinance," or similar terms, to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _____ to _____" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code that embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated in the Code). 
                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of the ordinances inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
                  Sec. 1-10. - Altering Code.

                  (e)  The imposition of a penalty does not prohibit equitable relief to include stop work orders and temporary restraining orders or injunctions when applicable. 
                  (f)  The imposition of a penalty does not prohibit revocation or suspension of a license, permit, or franchise or the imposition of other administrative sanctions.

Such records include, but are not limited to, security plans, vulnerability assessments for public buildings or facilities, anti-terrorist plans, plans or blueprints that reveal security devices or otherwise compromise security and contingency plans for meetings. 
                  (2)  Procedure for entering into executive sessions.

No other individuals shall be permitted in the executive session. 
                  (4)  Nonexempt topics. If a commissioner or any other person in an executive session attempts to discuss a nonexempt topic during an executive session, the chairperson shall immediately rule that commissioner or other person out of order and such discussion shall cease.

                  b.  Other executive sessions. Minutes of executive sessions devoted to any topic other than land acquisition may be maintained by the county administrator/clerk at the direction of the chairperson.

                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
                  (1)  Built on a single chassis; 
                  (2)  400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
                  (3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and 
                  (4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: Accessory structures are not exempt from any article requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the start of construction of the improvement. Note: The market value of the structure should be the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or, in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (i) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing provisions of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (ii) any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
                  Sec. 8-72. - Authorization. 
                  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the board of county commissioners does ordain this article. 
                  Sec. 8-73. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  Sec. 8-74. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  Sec. 8-75. - Objectives. 
                  The objectives of this article are:

                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
                  Sec. 8-76. - Lands to which this article applies. 
                  This article shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the county.

                  DIVISION 3. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 8-121. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater: 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction; 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms; 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces; 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
                  Sec. 8-122. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 8-121(4), pertaining to elevated buildings. All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 8-103(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (i) on individual lots or parcels, (ii) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (iii) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (iv) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. section 8-121(6).) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.  Meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections (3)a and (3)c of this section. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established section 8-77 are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection (4)a of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 3 of this article. 
                  Sec. 8-123. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 8-77, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 8-77, then the administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of division 3 of this article. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  b.  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (Note: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 8-121(4), pertaining to elevated buildings. All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  (2)  The administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  Sec. 8-124. - Standards for areas of special flood hazard (zones AE) with established base flood elevations without designated floodways. 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 8-77, where streams with base flood elevations are provided but no floodways have been designated (zones AE), the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 
                  (2)  New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or floodproofed to elevations established in accordance with section 8-122. 
                  Sec. 8-125. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). 
                  Areas of special flood hazard established in section 8-77 may include designated AO shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 8-121(4), pertaining to elevated buildings. The administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in sections 8-102(a)(1)c and 8-102(a)(2). 
                  (3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure. 
                  Sec. 8-126. - Standards for subdivisions. 
                  The following are standards for subdivisions: 
                  (1)  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
                  (2)  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
                  (3)  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and 
                  (4)  For subdivisions and/or developments greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less, base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions. Any changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted to FEMA for review as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. Upon completion of the project, the developer is responsible for submitting the as-built data to FEMA in order to obtain the final LOMR.

                  DIVISION 4. - VARIANCES 

                  Sec. 8-151. - Procedures. 
                  (a)  The county floodplain board as established by the board of county commissioners shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the county floodplain board may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Washington County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the county floodplain board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances. 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed in this section and the purposes of this article, the county floodplain board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  Sec. 14-1. - Regulations continued in effect. 
                  All ordinances, resolutions, motions and orders pertaining to civil defense, emergency management and disaster relief, which are not in conflict with this chapter, are continued in full force and effect. Such ordinances, etc., are on file in the office of the board of commissioners. 
                  Sec. 14-2. - Emergency management and response powers. 
                  (a)  Declaration of local emergency. 
                  (1)  Grant of authority. In the event of an actual or threatened occurrence of a disaster or emergency, which may result in the large-scale loss of life, injury, property damage or destruction or in the major disruption of routine community affairs, business or governmental operations in the county and which is of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant extraordinary assistance by federal, state and local departments and agencies to supplement the efforts of available public and private resources, the chairperson of the board of commissioners may declare a local emergency for the county. The form of the declaration shall be similar to that provided in subsection (b) of this section. 
                  (2)  Request for state assistance. Consistent with a declaration of local emergency, the chairperson may request the governor to provide assistance, provided that the disaster or emergency is beyond the capacity of the county to meet adequately and state assistance is necessary to supplement local efforts to save lives and protect property, public health and safety, or to avert or lessen the threat of a disaster. 
                  (3)  Continuance. The declaration of local emergency shall continue until the chairperson finds that emergency conditions no longer exist, at which time, the chairperson shall execute and file with the county administrator/clerk of the board of commissioners a document marking the end of the state of emergency. No state of local emergency shall continue for longer than 30 days, unless renewed by the chairperson. The board of commissioners may, by resolution, end a state of local emergency at any time. 
                  (4)  Effect of declaration of emergency. 
                  a.  Activation of emergency operations plan. A declaration of emergency by the governor or a declaration of local emergency by the chairperson shall automatically activate the county emergency operations plan and shall be the authority for deployment of personnel and use of any forces to which the plan applies and for use or distribution of any supplies, equipment, materials, and facilities assembled, stockpiled or arranged to be made available pursuant to the Georgia Emergency Management Act or any other laws applicable to emergencies or disasters. 
                  1.  The county emergency management agency (EMA) director shall have the legal authority to exercise the powers and discharge the duties conferred upon the emergency management agency, including the implementation of the emergency operations plan, coordination of the emergency responses of public and private agencies and organizations, coordination of recovery efforts with state and federal officials, and inspection of emergency or disaster sites. 
                  2.  In responding and conducting necessary and appropriate investigations, the director or his designee is authorized to enter at a reasonable time upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigating and inspecting sites involved with emergency management functions. The director is authorized to execute a right of entry and/or agreement to use property for these purposes on behalf of the county; however, any such document shall be later presented for ratification at a meeting of the board of commissioners. 
                  3.  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the county who requests entry for purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials. Nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while that individual is in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  b.  Emergency powers. Following a declaration of emergency and during the continuance of such state of emergency, the chairperson is authorized to implement local emergency measures to protect life and property or to bring the emergency situation under control. In exercising this authority, the chairperson may cause to become effective the following section of this chapter as appropriate: section 14-5 (closed or restricted areas and curfews). If any of these sections are included in a declaration of local emergency, the same shall be filed in the office of the county administrator/clerk of the board of commissioners and shall be in effect until the declaration of local emergency has terminated. 
                  c.  Authority to waive procedures and fees. Pursuant to a declaration of emergency, the board of commissioners is authorized to cause to be effective any of the subsections of section 14-4 as appropriate. The implementation of such subsections shall be filed in the office of the county administrator/clerk of the board of commissioners. 
                  d.  Additional emergency powers. The chairperson of the board of commissioners shall have, and may exercise for such period as the declared emergency exists or continues, the following additional emergency powers: 
                  1.  To direct and compel the evacuation of all or part of the population from any stricken or threatened area, for the preservation of life or other disaster mitigation, response or recovery; 
                  2.  To prescribe routes, modes of transportation and destinations in connection with evacuation; 
                  3.  To suspend or limit the sale, dispensing or transportation of alcoholic beverages, firearms, explosives and flammable liquids and substances; 
                  4.  To make provision for the availability and use of temporary emergency housing, emergency shelters and/or emergency medical shelters. 
                  5.  To transfer the direction, personnel or functions of any county departments and agencies or units thereof for the purpose of performing or facilitating emergency services; 
                  6.  To utilize all available resources of the county and subordinate agencies over which the county has budgetary control as reasonably necessary to cope with the emergency or disaster; 
                  7.  To utilize public property when necessary to cope with the emergency or disaster or when there is compelling necessity for the protection of lives, health and welfare; and/or the property of citizens; 
                  8.  To suspend any law, code provision or regulation prescribing the procedures for conduct of county business, or the orders, rules or regulations of any county agency, if strict compliance with any ordinance, resolution, order, rule or regulation would in any way prevent, hinder or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency or disaster, provided that such suspension shall provide for the minimum deviation from the requirements under the circumstances and further provided that, when practicable, specialists shall be assigned to avoid adverse effects resulting from such suspension; 
                  9.  To provide benefits to citizens upon execution of an intergovernmental agreement for grants to meet disaster-related necessary expenses or serious needs of individuals or families adversely affected by an emergency or disaster in cases where the individuals or families are unable to meet the expenses or needs from other means, provided that such grants are authorized only when matching state or federal funds are available for such purposes; 
                  10.  To perform and exercise such other functions, powers and duties as may be deemed necessary to promote and secure the safety and protection of the civilian population, including individuals with household pets and service animals prior to, during and following a major disaster or emergency. 
                  (b)  Form of declaration of local emergency. Upon the declaration of local emergency, an official "declaration of local emergency," in substantially the same form set forth in this subsection, shall be signed and filed in the office of the county administrator/clerk and shall be communicated to the citizens of the affected area using the most effective and efficient means available.

                  Sec. 14-4. - Authority to waive procedures and fee structures. 
                  (a)  County business. Upon declaration of an emergency or disaster by the governor or chairperson of the board of commissioners, the affairs and business of the county may be conducted at places other than the regular or usual location, within or outside of the county, when it is not prudent, expedient or possible to conduct business at the regular location. When such meetings occur outside of the county, all actions taken by the board of commissioners shall be as valid and binding as if performed within the county. Such meetings may be called by the presiding officer or any two members of the board of commissioners without regard to or compliance with time-consuming procedures and formalities otherwise required by law. 
                  (b)  Public works contracts. Upon declaration of an emergency or disaster by the governor or chairperson of the board of commissioners, the board of commissioners may contract for public works without letting such contract out to the lowest, responsible bidder and without advertising and posting notification of such contract for four weeks; provided, however, that the emergency must be of such nature that immediate action is required and that the action is necessary for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare. Any public works contract entered into pursuant to this subsection shall be entered on the minutes of the county as soon as practical and the nature of the emergency described therein in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 36-91-22(e).

Upon declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor or chairperson of the board of commissioners, the board of commissioners may temporarily suspend the enforcement of the ordinances of the county, or any portion thereof, where the emergency is of such nature that immediate action outside the code is required, such suspension is consistent with the protection of the public health, safety and welfare, and such suspension is not inconsistent with any federal or state statutes or regulations. 
                  (e)  Fees. Upon declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor or chairperson of the board of commissioners, the board of commissioners may temporarily reduce or suspend any permit fees, application fees or other rate structures as necessary to encourage the rebuilding of the areas impacted by the disaster or emergency. 
                  (1)  The term "fees" includes fees or rates charged by the county for building permits, land disturbance permits, zoning applications, special land use permits, temporary land use permits and other fees relating to the reconstruction, repair and clean up of areas impacted by the disaster or emergency. 
                  (2)  The term "fees" does not include fees collected by the county on behalf of the state or federal government or fees charged by the county pursuant to a state or federal statute or regulation. 
                  (f)  Temporary dwellings. Upon the declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor or chairperson of the board of commissioners, the board of commissioners or its designees may issue temporary mobile home, trailer, recreational vehicle or other temporary dwelling structures or parks in any zoning district, even though not otherwise permitted by development code, while the primary dwelling is being repaired, provided that such temporary dwellings or parks are designed by an engineer and the plans are approved by the county health department and development services. The temporary permit shall not exceed six months in duration.

                  ARTICLE II. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREA PROTECTION 

                  Sec. 18-19. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Aquifer means any stratum (rock layer) or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well. 
                  Groundwater recharge area (synonymous with aquifer recharge area) means an area of the earth's surface where water infiltrated the ground, thereby replenishing the groundwater supplies within an aquifer. 
                  Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of groundwater to pollution from chemical spills, leaching of pollutants from dump sites, animal waste from agricultural operations or pollution generated by other human activities. 
                  Pollution susceptibility maps means maps prepared by the state department of natural resources (DNR) that show the relative susceptibility of groundwater to pollution. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas of high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential. 
                  Significant groundwater recharge areas means areas mapped by the state department of natural resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 edition. Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology (chemical nature and form of the rock), soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts, geologic structure, presence of karst topography (sinkholes, caves and fissures associated with limestone and other carbonate rocks), and potentiometric surfaces. 
                  (Res. No. WC-59, § 10, 1-11-2001) 
                  Sec. 18-20. - Title; findings; objectives. 
                  (a)  Title. This article shall be known as the "groundwater recharge area protection ordinance of the county." 
                  (b)  Findings of fact. In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the county and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources contained within aquifers, which are permeable, rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized. 
                  (c)  Objectives. The objectives of this article are to protect groundwater quality by: 
                  (1)  Restricting land uses that generate, use or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas; 
                  (2)  Limiting density of development; and 
                  (3)  Ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality. 
                  (Res. No. WC-59, § 1, 1-11-2001) 
                  Sec. 18-21. - Establishment of a district.

                  Sec. 18-61. - Penalty; suspension; revocation. 
                  (a)  Any person who commits, takes part in or assists in any violation of any provision of this article may be fined not more than $500.00 for each offense. Each violation shall be a separate offense and, in the case of a continuing violation, each day's continuance shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense. 
                  (b)  When a building or other structure has been constructed in violation of this article, the violator may be required to remove the structure at the discretion the county. 
                  (c)  When removal of vegetative cover, excavation or fill has taken place in violation of this article, the violator may be required to restore the affected land to its original contours and to restore vegetation, as far as practicable, at the discretion of the county. 
                  (d)  If the county discovers a violation of this article that also constitutes a violation of any provision of the Clean Water Act as amended, the county shall issue written notification of the violation to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the landowner. 
                  (e)  Suspension; revocation. The county may suspend or revoke a permit if it finds that the applicant has not complied with the conditions or limitations set forth in the permit or has exceeded the scope of work set forth in the permit.

                  (Res. No. WC-60, § 5, 1-11-2001) 
                  Sec. 18-62. - Findings and purpose. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. The wetlands within the county are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state. Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. It is therefore necessary for the county to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities that may adversely affect wetlands. 
                  (b)  Title and purpose. This article shall be known as the "wetland protection ordinance" for the county. The purpose of this article is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this article is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic nature and wildlife habitat. 
                  (Res. No. WC-60, § 1, 1-11-2001) 
                  Sec. 18-63. - Wetland protection district. 
                  (a)  Applicability. This article shall apply to all lands within wetlands located within the jurisdiction of the county. The generalized wetland map, adopted as part of this article, shows the general location of wetlands and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the county administrator/clerk. 
                  (b)  District boundaries. The generalized wetland map is a general reference document, and the wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the county and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
                  (Res. No. WC-60, § 2, 1-11-2001) 
                  Sec. 18-64. - Local development permits. 
                  (a)  Local development permit requirements. No regulated activity will be allowed within the wetland protection district without written permission from the county in the form of a local development permit. Issuance of a local development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. All activities that are not identified in subsection (b) of this section shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a local development permit. If the area proposed for development is located within 200 feet of the wetland protection district boundary, as determined by the locally appointed enforcement official from the generalized wetland map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site and that a section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, a local development permit will be issued only following issuance of the section 404 permit or letter of permission. The locally appointed enforcement official shall be responsible for coordinating the necessary permitting process between the applicant and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  (b)  Permissible uses (uses as of right). The following uses shall be allowed as of right within a wetland to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging except as provided in this subsection: 
                  (1)  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require an additional 404 permit. 
                  (2)  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing. 
                  (3)  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission and as specified in section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
                  (4)  The continued cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture. 
                  (5)  The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed. 
                  (6)  Education, scientific research and nature trails. 
                  (c)  Temporary emergency permit. A temporary emergency permit can be issued by the county for the following reasons: 
                  (1)  Maintenance or repair of lawfully located roads or structures and of facilities used in the service of the public to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telegraph, telecommunication or other services, provided that such roads, structures, or facilities are not materially changed or enlarged and written notice prior to the commencement of work has been given to the county and provided that the work is conducted using best management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns and chemical and biological characteristics of the wetland are not impaired and that any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be minimized. 
                  (2)  Temporary water-level stabilization measures associated with ongoing silvicultural operations. 
                  (3)  Limited ditching, tilling, dredging, excavating or filling done solely for the purpose of maintaining or repairing existing drainage systems necessary for the cultivation of agricultural crops, provided that the maintenance or repair activity does not result in the impairment, alteration or loss of wetlands not previously subject to agricultural and silvicultural use under the terms and provisions of subsection (b)(4) of this section. 
                  (4)  Limited excavating and filling necessary for the repair and maintenance of piers, walkways, nature trails, observation decks, wildlife management shelters, boathouses or other similar water-related structures, provided that they are built on pilings to allow unobstructed flow of water and preserve the natural contour of the wetland. 
                  (d)  Site plans. Applications for a local development permit within the generalized wetland protection district shall include a site plan, drawn at a scale of one inch equals 50 feet or other approved scale, with the following information: 
                  (1)  A map of all planned excavation and fill, including calculations of the volume of cut and fill involved, cross sectional drawings showing existing and proposed grades. Elevations, horizontal scale and vertical scale must be shown on the cross sectional drawings. 
                  (2)  A map of any wetland boundaries occurring within the site must be provided. This boundary may be included on other maps provided by the applicant. 
                  (3)  Location, dimensions and area of all impervious surfaces, both existing and proposed, on the site and adjacent to the site for a distance of 200 feet. 
                  (4)  The orientation and distance from the boundaries of the proposed site to the nearest bank of an affected perennial stream or water body. 
                  (5)  Elevations of the site and adjacent lands within 200 feet of the site at contour intervals of no greater than two feet; and no greater than one foot for slopes less than or equal to two percent. 
                  (6)  Location and detailed design of any spill and leak collection systems designed for the purpose of containing accidentally released hazardous or toxic materials. 
                  (7)  All proposed temporary disruptions or diversions of local hydrology. 
                  (e)  Activities to comply with site plan. All development activities or site work conducted after approval of the site plan shall conform to the specifications of said plan. The site plan may be amended only with the approval of the county. The county may require additional information deemed necessary to verify compliance with the provisions of this article or to evaluate the proposed use in terms of the purpose of this article. 
                  (f)  Filing fee. At the time of the application, the applicant shall pay a filing fee specified by the county. Filing fees in a minimum amount of $50.00 or $15.00 per acre, whichever is greater, may be required to evaluate the application. This fee may be used to retain expert consultants who will provide services pertaining to functional assessment, mitigation and wetland boundary determinations as deemed necessary by the county. 
                  (g)  Enforcement authority. A person or persons appointed by the board of county commissioners (hereinafter enforcement official) is hereby established as the administrator of this article. 
                  (h)  Review procedures. The application shall be made to the enforcement official and will be reviewed within 60 days.

                  River corridor means all land, inclusive of islands, not regulated under the Metropolitan River Protection Act (O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-440—12-5-457), or the Coastal Marshland Protection Act (O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-280—12-5-293), in areas of a protected river and being within 100 feet horizontally on both sides of the river as measured from the river banks. The 100-foot buffer shall be measured horizontally from the uppermost part of the river bank, usually marked by a break in slope. Although not within the measured 100-foot wide buffer, the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river shall be treated by local governments in the same manner as the river corridor and shall be included within the river corridor protection plan. Because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering, riverbank erosion, and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time. For the purposes of these standards, the river corridor shall be considered to be fixed at its position at the beginning of each review period for local comprehensive plans. Any shift in the location of the protected river after the start of the review period will require a revision of the boundaries of the river corridor at the time of the next review by the department of community affairs. 
                  River corridor protection plan means that part of the local comprehensive plan which deals with the river corridor protection requirements specified herein. 
                  Sensitive natural areas means any area, as identified now or hereafter by the state department of natural resources, which contains one or more of the following:

                  Sec. 18-99. - Boundaries of the district. 
                  (a)  The river corridor protection district consists of a natural vegetative buffer area extending 100 feet from the top of the riverbank on the eastern side of the Oconee River within the county and the western side of the Ogeechee River within the county as established by the state. Also included is the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river, although this strip of land is not included as part of the 100-foot buffer requirement contained in the minimum standards. 
                  (b)  The top of the riverbank is defined as the uppermost part of the riverbank, usually marked by a break in the slope. All land that lies within this corridor is part of the river corridor protection district. The river corridor protection district is delineated on the protected river corridors map, which is made a part of this article by reference, and is used to show the boundaries of the river corridor protection district.

The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent any issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

                  Sec. 20-22. - Findings. 
                  The incineration of biomedical waste is increasingly proposed as a partial alternative to land disposal, however incineration of biomedical waste poses certain hazards to the environment and creates special problems of residue disposal in landfills. Also, other facilities that handle and dispose of biomedical waste pose certain unique hazards and are of special public concern. Under article 9, section 2, paragraph 3 of the Georgia Constitution and under the provisions of the Georgia Solid Waste Management Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-8-39) local governments are empowered with the responsibility to regulate biomedical waste incinerator facilities and biomedical waste disposal facilities in such manner as to ensure the public health, safety and welfare.

                  Sec. 22-19. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Manufactured home shall have the definition contained in O.C.G.A. § 8-2-131, a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which, in the traveling mode, is eight body feet or more in width or 40 body feet or more in length or, when erected on site, is 320 or more square feet and which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used as a dwelling with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities and includes the plumbing, heating, air-conditioning, and electrical systems contained therein; except that such term shall include any structure which meets all the requirements of this paragraph except the size requirements and with respect to which the manufacturer voluntarily files a certification required by the secretary of housing and urban development and complies with the standards established under the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. Section 5401, et seq. 
                  Mobile home means a mobile home as such term is defined in O.C.G.A. § 8-2-131(4), including such mobile home which is permanently located on property owned by owner of such mobile home or his spouse. The term "mobile home" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which, in the traveling mode, is eight body feet or more in width or 40 body feet or more in length or, when erected on site, is 320 or more square feet and which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used as a dwelling with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities and includes the plumbing, heating, air conditioning, and electrical systems contained therein and manufactured prior to June 15, 1976. 
                  (Ord. No. WC-47, § 1, 8-13-1981; Res. No. 2014-4, 6-12-2014) 
                  Sec. 22-20. - Penalty. 
                  Any person violating the provisions of this article shall be guilty of an ordinance violation and upon the conviction thereof, shall be punished as provided by law. Each day on continued violation shall constitute a separate offense. 
                  (Ord. No. WC-47, § 8, 8-13-1981) 
                  Sec. 22-21. - Permit and decal required; conditions to be satisfied. 
                  (a)  Payment of taxes. Prior to a mobile home or manufactured home being transported into the county, or relocated, or located into Washington County, a permit to transport must be obtained from the tax assessor and a decal showing payment of taxes must be obtained from the tax commissioner. Both items are required for such transport, location or relocation of such home in the county. Transporting or relocating or locating a mobile home or manufactured home without first obtaining such permit and decal is a violation of this article, and is punishable as permitted by this Code. 
                  (b)  Water and sewage system approval. Before a permit to transport and a decal showing taxes paid shall be issued for the location or relocation of a mobile home or manufactured home within the limits of the county, applicant must first submit to the tax assessor and the tax commissioner of the county, proof that the county board of health has approved the individual water system and the individual sewage system used or to be used in connection with said mobile home or manufactured home. This section shall not apply as to renewal permits, provided there has been no relocation of the mobile home or manufactured home since the last permit was issued. 
                  (c)  Certification of occupancy. Prior to the issuance of a permit by the tax assessor for transport, relocation, or location, the homeowner, landlord, or transporter must submit a certification from a certified home inspector, certifying that the mobile home or manufactured home meets minimum occupancy and safety standards. No permit will issue unless said certification is presented at the time of application. If however the mobile home to be transported is new, purchased from a manufacturer, then a receipt of such new purchase will suffice in place of a certification of occupancy and safety. 
                  (1)  Home inspectors with credentials from ASHI or GAHI will be accepted as certified home inspectors. 
                  (2)  Minimum occupancy and safety standards shall mean at a minimum that the home is structurally sound and the plumbing and electrical systems are sound. 
                  (3)  The county will provide forms for applicant to be executed either by a manufacturer, dealer, or home inspector, as appropriate.

                  No person shall occupy any mobile home or manufactured home as a residence nor permit any other person to occupy the same as a residence unless a permit and decal shall have been obtained as provided by this article. 
                  (Ord. No. WC-47, § 5, 8-13-1981; Res. No. 2014-4, 6-12-2014) 
                  Sec. 22-25. - Permit conditions—For park. 
                  No owner or operator of a mobile home park shall permit any mobile home or manufactured home to be located or relocated within the confines of such park for residential use unless the permit and decal required by this article shall have been obtained. No owner or operator of any mobile home park shall permit any mobile home or manufactured home presently located within the limits of such park owned or operated by him to remain in such park after the date of the ordinance from which this article is derived unless a permit and decal authorizing such continued location as required by this article shall have been obtained.

                  Right-of-way miter means a right-of-way line at an intersection, which is parallel to neither road but forms a triangle with extensions of the ROW lines of the adjacent sides of the intersecting roads. The purpose of the ROW miter is to provide improved visibility for vehicles approaching the intersection by enabling the county to eliminate visual obstructions or provide room for a traffic signal support pole or guy wire.

The distance is measured based on an eye height of 3.5 feet and an object height of 3.5 feet. Sight distance should be determined to provide adequate time for an entering vehicle to accelerate to within ten mph of posted speed limit, prior to being overtaken by approaching vehicles. (Refer to AASHTO, Green Book.) 
                  Stopping sight distance means the sum of two distances: the distance traversed by the vehicle from the instant the driver sights an object necessitating a stop to the instant the brakes are applied and the distance required to stop the vehicle from the instant brake application begins. Stopping sight distance is measured based on an eye height of 3.5 feet and an object height of 2.0 feet. 
                  Utility means all privately, publicly or cooperatively owned water distribution and sanitary sewer facilities and systems for producing, transmitting or distributing communication, cable television, power, electricity, light, heat, gas, oil, crude products, steam, wastewater and stormwater not connected with highway drainage, including river gages, fire and police signals, traffic control devices, and street lighting systems, which directly or indirectly serve the public or any part thereof.

The post-to-box attachment details should be of sufficient strength to prevent the box from separating from the post top if a vehicle strikes the installation. Figures of acceptable attachment details and acceptable mailbox support assemblies are available from the county. 
                  Sec. 26-73. - Removal of nonconforming or unsafe mailboxes. 
                  The postal patron upon notification by the county shall remove any mailbox that is found to violate this policy. If such patron does not comply with the removal request it will be the county's prerogative to remove such mailbox. The following procedure may be used by the county to address an unacceptable mailbox: 
                  (1)  A letter shall be sent by certified mail to the postal patron stating that the patron has 30 calendar days to remove or modify the unacceptable mailbox. 
                  (2)  After 30 calendar days if the mailbox is not removed or made to comply, a second letter shall be sent by certified mail, advising the owner that the county will be removing the patron's mailbox after 15 calendar days. 
                  (3)  After the time limit on the second letter has expired, the county may schedule the removal of the mailbox. 
                  (4)  The removed mailbox will not be reinstalled but shall be placed out of the clear zone and next to the property line if possible. If placement of the removed mailbox is not possible out of the clear zone or on the patron's property by authorization, the mailbox shall be disposed of.

                  DIVISION 3. - RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL DRIVEWAYS 

                  Sec. 26-101. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of the driveway permit process is to manage access on the county road system. Access regulations are necessary in order to preserve the functional integrity of the county road system and to promote the safe and efficient movement of people and goods. 
                  Sec. 26-102. - When driveway permits are required. 
                  A driveway permit is required prior to performing any construction work or nonroutine maintenance within the county rights-of-way. This generally includes residential and commercial driveways, but this may also include but is not limited to the following: grading, landscaping, drainage work, or construction of a development. Any revisions to any portion of existing driveways (i.e., widening and/or relocation that are within the county rights-of-way) shall also require a permit. In addition to being unlawful, performing the above-described work within the county rights-of-way without a permit shall entitle the county to barricade, displace, or otherwise close such driveway and to collect the costs thereof from the violator as provided for in this article. 
                  Sec. 26-103. - Application. 
                  (a)  Application to perform any construction or nonroutine maintenance work within county rights-of-way must be made to the county. 
                  (b)  Application for a permit under these regulations will be accepted only from the property owner, leaser or an official representing the company, organization, or group, which owns or leases the property abutting the ROW and upon which the driveway will be constructed. In the event the applicant leases the property to be served by the driveway, the lease should be for a period of at least three years; otherwise the permit must be issued to the property owner. In any case, written acknowledgement of the permit work must be obtained from the owner or his agent. In cases where a site with multiple owners is being developed by a single entity under a development agreement, the developer may apply for the permit. A copy of the development agreement between the developer and all affected property owners must be included with the application. The agreement must give responsibility for developing all affected driveways to the entity that is making application. When application is made by an agent of the owner or if the owner is a partnership or corporation, written authorization allowing the agent to act on behalf of the owner must be provided by applicant. An application for right-of-way encroachment may be obtained from the county. 
                  Sec. 26-104. - Preliminary site plan review. 
                  For large developments, the applicant's engineer is encouraged to meet with the public works director early in the plan development process. A preliminary site plan is helpful to facilitate the exchange of information so the public works director can see the intent of the applicant. The preliminary site plan will also be useful in discussing the relevant requirements of these regulations. 
                  Sec. 26-105. - Performance bonds for commercial driveways only. 
                  Each applicant will provide a performance bond or letter of escrow to ensure that the authorized commercial driveway is accomplished in accordance with the approved permit. In cases of noncompliance, the bond will be used to offset the cost of correcting or removing uncompleted or unauthorized work, and to offset the cost of any damages incurred by the county or other parties as a result of the work or activities of the applicant in relation to this permit. The amount of the bond or letter of escrow is based on the estimated construction costs as determined by the county. A bond may be underwritten by a company housed outside of the state, if a state resident agent of said surety company countersigns. All letters of escrow must be from a bank housed in the state. Blanket performance bonds are acceptable. The blanket bond must contain the name of the owner or entity that is making application for permit. If the site is being developed on behalf of more than one owner under a development agreement, the surety must be in the name of the developer making application. A letter of credit from a bank housed in the state may be used for surety. It must be written without expiration or be written so as to automatically renew annually and the bank must agree to notify the county by registered letter at least 60 days prior to its expiration date if it does not intend to renew the letter of credit. 
                  Sec. 26-106. - Plan requirements for commercial driveways only. 
                  The applicant must submit construction drawings stamped by a registered engineer in the state with the permit application. Plans must conform to the minimum guidelines described herein. In addition, the applicant's engineer shall also use his judgment to prepare plans that conform to accepted guidance including but not limited to the most current edition of A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets published by AASHTO and the GDOT Regulations for Driveway and Encroachment Control. When submitting plans for review, the applicant must provide four sets of construction drawings. The county prefers plans with 24 inch by 36 inch sheet size or smaller. A plan review checklist containing information that should be shown on the construction plans is available from the county. 
                  Sec. 26-107. - Commercial driveway permit procedures. 
                  The plan review and application process is initiated when the applicant or their engineer submits an application permit, the necessary construction drawings to the county and the application fee as set from time to time by the board of county commissioners. When the county has completed its review of the permit and the plans and any necessary revisions have been made to their satisfaction, the applicant will be notified that his permit has been approved. The applicant is required to notify the county when the work will begin and when the work is complete. The works must be completed to the satisfaction of the county before the project can be accepted and the bond released. The project must be constructed according to the approved permitted plans. If, during the construction of the work, questions arise or unforeseen conditions are encountered, the contractor shall contact the county for consultation. The county will require as-built drawings if significant modifications are approved in the field. It is the responsibility of the property owner to provide routine maintenance of the pipe and driveway up to the roadway edge without making improvements to it as governed by the permit process including driveways installed prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived. 
                  Sec. 26-108. - Residential driveway permit procedures. 
                  (a)  The county administers residential driveway permits and the application fee, as set from time to time by the board of county commissioners. The county will advise the applicant regarding location of the drive, the size pipe if required to be placed under the driveway, and approve the grading plan from the outer edge of the road to the ROW line. Residential driveways are, as the name implies, driveways to private residences. Normally they are a minimum 20 feet wide. It is recommended that turnarounds be provided to avoid vehicles backing into the roadway. Under special circumstances, certain design vehicles require more width to safely negotiate a turn into or out of the drive without stopping and/or backing on the roadway. The county may also approve a driveway wider than 20 feet. If the driveway is paved, but without curb and gutter, there should be at least two-foot shoulder along the drive and around the radii before beginning the slope down to the drainage ditch. The front slope, back slope and the slope around the end of the drain pipe under the drive, if present, should be the same as if it were a commercial driveway. All side drain pipes larger than 48 inches must have an inlet and an outlet headwall. Only safety headwalls or those specifically approved by the county are allowed. On residential driveways this can be accomplished in several ways. If the pipe is corrugated metal and the applicant chooses to cut the end off to provide a 6:1 or flatter slope, he may install a concrete "collar" around the pipe end to provide stability and control erosion. Metal cross members must then be firmly attached to the pipe or collar at not more than two-foot spacing. The end treatment will be acceptable in lieu of attaching a prefabricated metal safety end treatment when applied to a residential driveway. When residential driveways are used to accommodate a semi-truck and trailer, the county will require the applicant to enlarge the driveway width to a minimum of 40 feet wide or larger if needed to appropriately permit ingress and egress of such semi-tractors, without the tractor entering into the ditch or right-of-way, and to be responsible for all additional driveway pipe and installation costs. It is the responsibility of the property owner to provide routine maintenance of the pipe and driveway up to the roadway without making improvements to it as governed by the permit process including driveways installed prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived. Per this article, the county will no longer maintain or repair driveways. However, this article does permit the county to repair drop off areas immediately adjacent to the pavement or roadway surface. If, during routine county maintenance of a roadside ditch, a residential driveway pipe is discovered to be nonfunctional, it is the property owner's responsibility to replace the subject pipe. Should a driveway pipe create an unsafe roadway or right-of-way condition due to its nonfunction, the county may remove the driveway pipe to return the area to a safe condition. The removed driveway pipe shall be placed out of the clear zone and next to the property line if possible. If placement of the removed driveway pipe is not possible out of the clear zone or on the owner's property by authorization, the driveway pipe shall be disposed of. 
                  (b)  A typical residential driveway plan and profile and other special requirements is available from the county. All driveway pipes must be made of corrugated metal or concrete pipe or DOT approved double walled type S composite pipe, must be of sufficient grade to withstand vehicular traffic, and must be of sufficient diameter to allow for anticipated flow of water. No used pipes will be permitted for installation of a permanent driveway. 
                  (c)  The provisions of this section for residential driveways will not apply to driveways in place prior to enactment of the ordinance from which this section is derived, but will apply to whole new renovations of existing driveways, as well as to all new driveways. 
                  (Res. No. 2015-2, 2-17-2015) 
                  Sec. 26-109. - Utility driveway permit procedures. 
                  Utility driveways for accesses to utility sites such as power substations, water tanks, or telephone services sites are to be permitted by the county and should be treated much the same as a residential driveway for design and sight distance. The utility driveway must function in such a manner, which will allow the utility vehicle to pull completely off the roadway without stopping and backing into the drive or having to back out into roadway when exiting the driveway. The vehicle must not reduce the site distance for driveway located along the same section of roadway. A utility driveway will normally not count as one allowed access point along an applicant's frontage, depending on the length of frontage and safety considerations. A typical utility driveway layout is available from the county. The county will administer the issuance of permits and accompanying fee as set from time to time by the board of county commissioners. Relocation of an existing driveway by county, state, and federal entities, within the ROW will not require issuance of a permit. 
                  Sec. 26-110. - Farm use, logging, and mining driveways. 
                  (a)  Farm use, logging and mining driveways are to be permitted in a manner similar to utility driveways. A logging driveway will be a temporary driveway. Such driveways are regulated under article III of this chapter, pertaining to timber operations. However, if the driveway is to be installed to become a farm use or any other use driveway, then a permit will be required and all provisions and requirements for a driveway permit must be met. A mining operation may require a more substantial design to function properly. All temporary driveways, as with all other driveways, must sufficiently provide for proper water flow, and must not impede anticipated water flow. 
                  (b)  Signage requirements for driveways described in (a) above shall be the same as those for logging driveways as provided for in section 26-224(b). 
                  (Res. No. 2015-2, 2-17-2015) 
                  Sec. 26-111. - General restrictions. 
                  No driveway approach or other improvements constructed on county ROW, as an exercise of the permit, shall be relocated or have its dimensions altered without the written permission of the county. 
                  (1)  A letter from the county approving the change should be obtained by the applicant who received a copy of the original permit. 
                  (2)  Parking is prohibited on county ROW except those instances where a temporary conditional special encroachment permit is approved for parking on the county ROW. 
                  (3)  Driveways should not be provided within the county ROW for purposes of parking, loading, servicing, etc. 
                  (4)  Geometric and safety requirements shall be maintained as stipulated in the permit and shall not be altered by the applicant. 
                  (5)  The applicant must take possession of an approved permit within 60 days of approval. If not, the permit will be canceled. 
                  (6)  Work under the permit shall begin within 90 days after approval. Failure to begin work will be cause for the permit to be canceled. 
                  (7)  Construction work authorized by an approved permit shall be completed within 12 months following approval of the permit. Permitted work not completed within 12 months, for just reasons, may be officially extended, by the county, for an additional six months. If the permitted work is not completed, action will be taken to secure the bond, escrow or letter of credit in order to complete the work or restore the county ROW. 
                  (8)  Once a permit has been canceled or voided, it cannot be reactivated or reinstated for any reason. A new permit must be submitted when the applicant is ready to begin work. This also includes the appropriate number of copies of up-to-date plans and all related documentation needed to review the application. 
                  (9)  New driveways to new businesses should not be opened for use by the traveling public until the final inspection and release of any bond or escrow by the county. In order to insure a timely release, the applicant is encouraged to coordinate all phases of work with the county. 
                  (10)  It is the responsibility of the property owner to provide routine maintenance of the commercial driveway up to the roadway edge of pavement without making improvements to it as governed by the permit process. Maintenance or replacement of the side drain pipe installed by the permittee will be their responsibility. 
                  Sec. 26-112. - Ownership of completed work. 
                  A median crossover constructed under a special encroachment permit or a commercial driveway permit becomes a feature of the roadway and the unconditional property of the county. The permit applicant or property owners and/or lessees adjacent to the ROW at the crossover site retain no ownership or legal interest therein. The county reserves the right and all authority to close, relocate or remove a crossover when such action is deemed necessary in the interest of public safety or efficiency of the roadway. 
                  Secs. 26-113—26-140. - Reserved. 
                  DIVISION 4. - ABOVEGROUND AND BELOWGROUND UTILITIES 

                  Sec. 26-141. - Purpose. 
                  Before any public utility may be installed or relocated within county ROW or across county ROW, application for a permit shall be made to the county. The application for the permit shall contain a description of the location, nature of the public utility, direction, height or depth, distance and such other information as the county may reasonably require. The term "public utility," for any purposes of this section, shall include but shall not be limited to water lines, gas lines, sewer lines, pipelines, telephone lines, power lines, telecommunication cables, conduits and every other structure or device which by physical or electronic means conveys energy or substance, whether overhead or underground, along with supporting pedestals, poles and equipment. 
                  Sec. 26-142. - Protection of traffic and roadway. 
                  It is the policy of the county that no public utility may occupy the county ROW unless sufficient space is available so that the free flow and safety of roadway traffic is not unduly impaired and the utility installation does not prevent the county from reasonably maintaining the roadways, structures, traffic control devices and other appurtenant facilities, and further provided that maintenance and operations of the utility do not jeopardize the traffic, or the highway structure or the maintenance thereof. 
                  Sec. 26-143. - Policy of relocation. 
                  The county reserves the right to require the utility or entity that provides utility services to remove, repair, adjust or relocate any utility facilities installed within the county ROW of a road which the county has undertaken to improve, or intends to improve when, in the opinion of the county, the facility constitutes an obstruction or interference with the use of safe operation of such road by the traveling public or will interfere with such construction of maintenance. All utilities or entities providing utility services utilizing the county ROW are expected to react to the county's notification of proposed projects in time sufficient to assure removal or relocation so as not to adversely affect the county's construction schedule for the project. The utility owner may be held liable for any damages or excess costs of construction when delays are caused by failure of a utility to relocate within a reasonable time. Upon receiving written notification from the county to remove, relocate, repair or adjust its facilities which are using or occupying county ROW, which the county has undertaken to improve, the utility owner shall within 60 days thereafter begin arrangements for said removal, relocation, repair or adjustment in accordance with the written notification and instructions from the public works director. Should the owner fail to comply with such notice within a reasonable time sufficient to allow for engineering and other procedures reasonably necessary to the removal and relocation of the facilities, the county may give the utility a final notice directing that such removal be begun not later than ten days from the receipt of the final notice. 
                  Sec. 26-144. - Plans, specifications, and supervision of work. 
                  Such work shall be done in accordance with construction plans and specifications prepared by a registered engineer in the state. These plans are subject to the approval of county, and the work shall be performed under the review of the county. In all cases, it will be necessary for project plans to show the size, type and extent of utility facilities located on county ROW. Also, in all cases, it will be necessary for the construction plans to show any proposed adjustment or relocation of the utility facilities within the county ROW. 
                  Sec. 26-145. - Location of utilities within county rights-of-way. 
                  (a)  Protection of service. Utilities are to be located so as to minimize the need for future adjustment to accommodate future roadway improvements and to permit access for servicing such facilities with minimum interference to roadway traffic. The county may, on a case-by-case basis, require the utility to be encased. 
                  (b)  Longitudinal installations. Longitudinal installations are to be located on uniform alignment as near as practical to the ROW line, usually a five-foot offset, so as to provide a safe environment for traffic operation and preserve space for future roadway improvements or other utility installations. Underground pipeline installations are not to be located within the pavement or between the edge of pavement and the ditch or toe of front slope except where no other practical alternative exists and a special request for exception is submitted to and approved by the county. 
                  (c)  Highway crossing installations. To the extent feasible and practicable, utility line crossing of the highway shall cross on a line generally normal to the highway alignment. 
                  (d)  Clear roadside areas. The horizontal and vertical location of utilities within the roadway ROW limits shall conform to the clear roadside policies applicable for the system, type of roadway, and specific conditions for the particular roadway section involved. Aboveground utilities are a form of roadside obstacles, and their location must be consistent with the clearances applicable to all roadside obstacles for the type roadway involved. 
                  (e)  Preservation of safety, visual quality and maintenance efficiency. Full consideration shall be given to the measures, reflecting sound engineering principles and economic factors, necessary to preserve and protect the integrity and visual quality of the highway, its maintenance efficiency, and the safety of highway traffic. 
                  Sec. 26-146. - Depth of pipe or main. 
                  No such pipe or main shall be laid upon any such ROW unless the same is at least 36 inches below the grade of such ROW, including 36 inches below the bottom grade of the ditch if crossing the ditch. 
                  Sec. 26-147. - Preservation, restoration, cleanup. 
                  (a)  Construction methods are to be in accordance with the GDOT's Standard Specifications, current edition. Unsatisfactory restoration work shall be promptly corrected by the permit applicant. If necessary, unsatisfactory restoration work will be corrected by the county and its cost billed to the permit applicant. 
                  (b)  Drainage. Care must be taken in utility installations to avoid disturbing existing drainage facilities. 
                  (c)  Vegetative management on the ROW. Cutting and trimming of trees and shrubs growing on the highway ROW shall be held to the minimum required for installation and preservation of utilities. Generally, the maximum amount of clearance allowed for the utility is ten feet. Bush hogging will be allowed in areas where it is done on a frequent enough basis to avoid unsightly cuttings. 
                  Sec. 26-148. - Safety and convenience of traffic. 
                  Traffic control for utility construction and maintenance operations shall conform to the MUTC. Individual traffic control plans may be required as directed by the county. 
                  Sec. 26-149. - Closing of trenches. 
                  Whenever open trenching is required for the installation or maintenance of utilities within the ROW, the work shall be so scheduled that not more than 500 feet of trench shall be open at any one time. More restrictive controls may be imposed where conditions warrant. Insofar as possible work shall be scheduled so that open excavations will not be left overnight. Where trenches or pits are within the clear roadside areas and cannot be backfilled before leaving the job site, they shall be cordoned off and protected by reflectorized or lighted barricades as appropriate, or by other safety means as deemed appropriate. 
                  Sec. 26-150. - Storage of materials. 
                  The storage of materials on the county ROW within the clear roadside area is prohibited, except upon specific approval by the county when no other practical alternative exists. When such approval is given special safety precautions may be necessary for the protection of highway traffic. Such precautions will be stipulated in the permit or in a separate approval. Storage of materials outside the clear roadside area shall be temporary only, for a sufficient duration to facilitate their incorporation into the construction, which shall be expeditiously pursued. 
                  Sec. 26-151. - Pavement cuts. 
                  No open cuts in pavement will be permitted except by special permission from the county when there is an emergency or for making a service tap on a line under the pavement when no other distribution line is available in the area where the service is required. In no event will an open cut be permitted when it is reasonably practical to bore, tunnel, etc., under the surface of the roadway. 
                  Sec. 26-152. - Underground utilities and other pipes or lines. 
                  (a)  It being the case that certain utilities, pipes, or lines that may run under county roads, may pose a hazard to said roads, utilities, lines, or pipes that run under a county road must be encased in a pipe which meets engineering standards or GDOT standards. The following list includes, but is not exhaustive, of all such utilities that must specifically meet these requirements: electric, gas, water, sewage, slurry, flowable suspendables, irrigation water, and any other pipe or line which may compromise the integrity of the road should failure occur. 
                  (b)  Additionally, any utilities, pipes, or lines to be run underneath county roads must take the shortest route, that is, must be run as perpendicular to the road it crosses as practicable. 
                  Sec. 26-153. - Disturbed areas. 
                  The size of the disturbed area during installation shall be kept to a minimum. 
                  Secs. 26-154—26-180. - Reserved. 
                  DIVISION 5. - SPECIAL ENCROACHMENTS 

                  Sec. 26-181. - Purpose. 
                  This division describes the county's process and standard of review to allow other entities to grade, landscape or otherwise conduct roadside encroachment activity within, under, or over county ROW. The responsibility for maintenance of permitted roadside landscape activities that are constructed on county ROW by entities other than the county shall be borne by the permit entity. 
                  Sec. 26-182. - Grading/excavating. 
                  The elevation of the roadway may affect the ability of the adjacent property owner to fully utilize their property. In those cases, changes to the grade of the roadway ROW may be a less expensive option than the construction of a retaining structure outside the ROW. Where there is a documented benefit to the county, applicants may be permitted to grade the right-of-way to reduce the cost of development. Grading that requires tree removal within 500 feet of an outdoor advertisement sign is prohibited. The following general requirements for grading or excavating must be adhered to: 
                  (1)  Typically, if an earth embankment is in place, it may be lowered but not totally removed. In "cut" sections a berm of four feet to six feet in height may be required between the roadway ditch or curb and the right-of-way line to prevent headlight glare from adjacent properties onto the roadway. 
                  (2)  All slopes associated with allowable grading on county ROW shall be 4:1 or flatter. 
                  (3)  Reimbursement for soil removal from county ROW shall be at a rate determined by the county. 
                  (4)  Mitigation for tree removal or disturbance is required. 
                  Sec. 26-183. - Aesthetics, landscaping, roadside development and maintenance, water on road. 
                  Treatment of the roadside may be considered to conserve, enhance, and effectively display the indigenous character and quality of the environment it passes through by means of proper location, design, construction, and maintenance of their related features. All landscaping, roadside development and maintenance shall conform to the GDOT Standard Specifications, current edition, and any procedures and manuals maintained by the GDOT office of maintenance, including MOG 6160 (Roadside Development—Georgia Highway Landscape Guide). Maintenance management activities may include: selective tree and shrub pruning in conformance with industry standards for fine or standard pruning and/ or removal; introduction of predominately low maintenance native plants and subsequent maintenance of unmanaged natural areas or other maintained areas of the ROW. No crown reduction pruning or tree abuse shall be permitted. Any water placed on or in county roads or rights-of-way by means other than natural precipitation is prohibited, other than the temporary spraying of roads to clean off accumulated mud.

                  Sec. 26-184. - Grading and landscape permit considerations. 
                  (a)  The county will give consideration for approval of grading and/or landscaping activities based on compatibility with primary use and protection of the county's investment in the roadway facility. Beneficial reasons for encroachment activity may include, but are not limited to the following: 
                  (1)  Improved shoulder or clear zone distances. 
                  (2)  Improved drainage. 
                  (3)  Elimination of hazards and/or guardrail. 
                  (4)  Reduced maintenance costs. 
                  (b)  Applications are reviewed to determine the impact of the encroachment on the following: 
                  (1)  Safety of motorists, pedestrians, and workers. 
                  (2)  Design, construction, operation, maintenance, or integrity of the highway system. 
                  (3)  Aesthetic. 
                  (4)  Environment. 
                  (5)  Existing drainage. 
                  (c)  An encroachment activity may be considered when there is no cost to the county and all negative real value changes to the ROW are reimbursed to the county. Items of real value include the costs for recurring maintenance, material removed, and the value of trees and other vegetation. Care must be taken to prevent encroachments that devalue county ROW. The applicant shall be responsible for all liability for personal injury and property damages for permitted activities. Permit applications may be acceptable if all the following items are satisfied: 
                  (1)  The county is compensated for removal of material or use of the ROW. 
                  (2)  No safety hazard is created. 
                  (3)  No additional maintenance is created. 
                  (4)  No additional liability is assumed by the county. 
                  (5)  No transportation use restriction is created. 
                  (6)  No unwanted easement or other permanent ROW encumbrance is created. 
                  (7)  Activity will not be detrimental to the future use or expansion of the roadway. 
                  (d)  Permits will not be issued for encroachments if any of the following conditions exists: 
                  (1)  The activity adversely affects the safety, capacity or integrity of the county road system. 
                  (2)  The activity compromises or jeopardizes the drainage system on the ROW. 
                  (3)  The activity is to grade, remove or prune trees, shrubs and groundcovers when the county has determined that the activities will significantly disrupt natural systems, roadside aesthetics, or have other negative impacts on the operation of the highway. Structural integrity and tree health as well as vegetative ground cover for erosion control are of primary importance to the maintenance of the ROW and shall not be compromised for purposes of grading to reduce development costs, day lighting, or landscaping development activities. 
                  (4)  Tree removal and/or grading for "daylighting" purposes when there is no benefit to the ROW or traveling public. 
                  (5)  The applicant has not complied with the provisions of prior permits. 
                  Sec. 26-185. - Permit procedures. 
                  All plans developed for a special encroachment permit shall be submitted to the county for review. In most cases, the applicant will be best served by providing four sets of preliminary site plans for an initial review. Upon receipt of an application with plans, the county shall check to ensure that plans and related documents are complete and meet the requirements of this procedure. The applicants will have 90 calendar days to revise the plans, should the county generate comments. New application submittal packages will be required after 90 days. The applicant shall submit two copies of the revised plans for final review by the county. If modifications to the plan are beyond the comments made or a major modification is made for other reasons, the plan should be treated as a preliminary submittal and rechecked. 
                  Sec. 26-186. - Plan requirements for special encroachments. 
                  When submitting plans for review, the applicant must provide four sets of construction drawings. The county prefers plans with 24 inch by 36 inch sheet size or smaller. A plan review checklist containing information that should be shown on the construction plans is available from the county. 
                  Sec. 26-187. - Removal of nonconforming special encroachments. 
                  The owner of a nonconforming special encroachment upon notification by the county shall remove any encroachment that is found to violate this policy. If such owner does not comply with the removal request it will be the county's prerogative to remove such encroachment. The following procedure may be used by the county to address a nonconforming special encroachment such as mailboxes, driveways, grading/excavating, etc.: 
                  (1)  A letter shall be sent by certified mail to the owner stating that the owner has 30 calendar days to remove or modify the nonconforming encroachment. 
                  (2)  After 30 calendar days if the nonconforming encroachment is not removed or made to comply, a second letter shall be sent by certified mail, advising the owner that the county will be removing the owner's nonconforming encroachment after 15 calendar days. 
                  (3)  After the time limit on the second letter has expired, the county may schedule the removal of the nonconforming encroachment. 
                  (4)  The removed nonconforming encroachment will not be reinstalled but shall be placed out of the clear zone and next to the property line if possible. If placement of the nonconforming encroachment is not possible out of the clear zone or on the owner's property by authorization, the nonconforming encroachment shall be disposed of. 
                  (5)  A violation of this section is punishable by a fine up to $1,000.00 and or 60 days imprisonment. Additionally, any cost associated with such removal will be placed as a lien on the subject property.

                  (5)  No person accused of violating this article shall be arrested prior to trial, but any defendant who fails to appear for trial shall be arrested thereafter on the warrant of the magistrate, and required to post a bond to his future appearance. 
                  (c)  Penalties. Pursuant to state law any person violating this article, or any provision hereof, upon conviction, shall be punished by one or more of the following:

                  Sec. 32-31. - Restricted road use by vehicles of certain weight rating. 
                  (a)  All motor vehicles having a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) or vehicle combinations with a gross combination weight rating (GCWR) in excess of 56,000 pounds, except vehicles designed to carry passengers, whether loaded or unloaded, are prohibited from using any road within the unincorporated county except those authorized as truck routes by this article, such routes being state roads or any other specified routes determined by the county. 
                  (b)  GVWR is the total weight a vehicle is rated to carry by the manufacturer, including its own weight and the weight of its load. GCWR is determined by adding the GVWR of the motor vehicle and the GVWR of any towed units. In the absence of a manufacturer assigned GVWR for a towed unit, the GVWR shall be the actual weight of the towed unit including any load carried thereon. 
                  (c)  Restricted vehicles must stay on designated truck routes unless a destination necessary for business, such as a pickup or delivery point, garage, or terminal, is accessible only via a nondesignated truck route or state highway. Ingress and egress to and from such points shall be made by the most direct route available from the nearest designated truck route. Such restricted vehicles include 18-wheelers used for agricultural purposes, mining, timber operations, and other applications.

The maximum gross weight shall then not exceed the maximum permitted gross weight for state-designated routes as provided for in O.C.G.A. § 32-6-26. Any truck operated on a county road not approved as a truck route must provide proof of compliance with the weight restriction for the road traveled. In the absence of such proof, there shall be a presumption of overweight status. 
                  (b)  A special permit shall be obtained to drive loaded or unloaded trucks greater than six wheels on a county road to a private residence or parking spot for parking. Such permit application shall include a certification that a proper driveway is in place at the residence or parking place to permit proper ingress and egress, and if on an unimproved road, applicant/driver shall further certify that he/she will not cause the road to become impassable for use by the general public. All ingress and egress routes will be determined by the county. 
                  Sec. 32-33. - Penalty. 
                  Any driver, company, or business that operates a vehicle in violation of this article is subject to penalties as provided by law and not to exceed $1,000.00 and or 60 days in jail. Any driver or company operating a vehicle in violation of this article may be further subject to civil penalties for any damage caused to county roads due to their violation. It shall not be a defense to a violation of this article that weight limit signs are not posted on roads. Rather, it shall be the responsibility of all drivers and operators in the county to be aware of all approved truck routes in the county, and to travel solely on state roads and approved truck routes. 
                  Sec. 32-34. - Oversized loads, special permits. 
                  The operation of oversized loads as defined by state law and off-road vehicles (such as equipment used for logging/forestry, agriculture, and mining) on county roads is a violation of this article. However, these operations are allowed through a special use permit obtained in advance from the county. 
                  Sec. 32-35. - Signs required for truck routes. 
                  (a)  The county shall post signage on those roads that are approved as truck routes. Further, a list of approved truck routes can be obtained from the county road department. For purposes of this article, all county truck routes are those designated as such by board of county commissioners. 
                  (b)  The current routes are all state routes in the county, and the following designated county-maintained roads: 
                  (1)  Old 85; 
                  (2)  Yank Brown Road;

                  (5)  Kaolin Road from Hwy. 68 to Hwy. 15. 
                  (c)  Any deletions or additions to these routes must be approved by the board of county commissioners. 
                  Sec. 32-36. - Enforcement by code enforcement officer. 
                  The code enforcement officer shall be empowered to enforce this article, and may inspect trucks on county roads that by appearance are overweight, or that may be overweight such as closed-container 18-wheelers. At no time may the code enforcement officer enforce any traffic violations or any other matters other than county ordinance violations.
