PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of Forsyth County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances and resolutions adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Palmer Carr, Senior Code Attorney, and William B. Eddy, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
                  The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Walker Bramblett, Senior Staff Attorney, for his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that his efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the county readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the county's affairs.

Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall continue or occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any Code section, whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the county may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief and revocation of licenses or permits. 
                  Section 5. Additions or amendments to the Code when passed in such form as to indicate the intention of the county to make the same a part of the Code shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments.

                  (1972 Ga. Laws, page 2065) 
                  Section 2. - Membership; composition. 
                  (a)  The board of commissioners of Forsyth County shall consist of five members. For the purpose [of] electing such members, Forsyth County shall be divided into five commissioner districts. The districts shall be and correspond to those five numbered districts described in and attached to and made a part of this Act and further identified as "Plan Name: forsythccsb-2011 Plan Type: Local User: bak". 
                  (b)  (1)  For the purposes of such plan: 
                  (A)  The term "VTD" shall mean and describe the same geographical boundaries as provided in the report of the Bureau of the Census for the United States decennial census of 2010 for the State of Georgia. The separate numeric designations in a district description which are underneath a "VTD" heading shall mean and describe individual Blocks within a VTD as provided in the report of the Bureau of the Census for the United States decennial census of 2010 for the State of Georgia; and 
                  (B)  Except as otherwise provided in the description of any district, whenever the description of any district refers to a named city, it shall mean the geographical boundaries of that city as shown on the census maps for the United States decennial census of 2010 for the State of Georgia. 
                  (2)  Any part of Forsyth County which is not included in any district described in subsection (b) of this section shall be included within that district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 2010 for the State of Georgia. 
                  (3)  Any part of Forsyth County which is described in subsection (b) of this section as being included in a particular district shall nevertheless not be included within such district if such part is not contiguous to such district. Such noncontiguous part shall instead be included within that district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 2010 for the State of Georgia. 
                  (c)  There shall be one member of the board from each commissioner district. A commissioner must reside in the commissioner district such person represents. A candidate shall designate the district from which such candidate offers for election. Beginning with the general election in 2010 and continuing in subsequent elections, members of the board shall be elected by the electors of their respective districts and not by the voters of the entire county. The election of members of the board shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 2 of Title 21 of the O.C.G.A., the "Georgia Election Code." 
                  (d)  The members of the board who were elected at the general election in November 2008 shall continue in office for the terms to which they were elected and until successors are elected and qualified as provided in this Act. The members of the board who were elected at the general election in November 2010 shall continue in office for the terms to which they were elected and until successors are elected and qualified as provided in this Act. 
                  (e)  The first members of the reconstituted board of commissioners of Forsyth County from Commissioner Districts 2, 4 and 5 shall be elected at the general election in November 2012. Such members shall take office on January 1 following their election for terms of four years and until their successors are elected and qualified. 
                  (f)  The first members of the reconstituted board of commissioners of Forsyth County from Commissioner Districts 2, 4, and 5 shall be elected at the general election in November 2004. Such members shall take office on January 1 following their election for terms of four years and until their successors are elected and qualified. 
                  (g)  Successors to members elected under subsections (e) and (f) of this section shall be elected at the November general election next preceding the expiration of such terms of office and shall take office on January 1 following their election for terms of four years and until their successors are elected and qualified. 
                  (h)  Commissioner Districts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 as they existed on January 1, 2011, shall continue to be designated as Commissioner Districts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively, but as newly described under this Act, and, on and after the effective date of this Act, such members of the board serving from those former commissioner districts shall be deemed to be serving from and representing their respective districts as newly described under this section.

                  (b)  All bonds, notes, and other obligations of the district shall be authorized by resolution of its board which shall be adopted by a majority vote of the board members at a regular or special meeting. 
                  (c)  Bonds, notes, or other obligations shall bear such date or dates, shall mature at such time or times (not more than 40 years from their respective dates), shall bear interest at such rate or rates (which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time), shall be subject to redemption on such terms and shall contain such other terms, provisions, covenants, assignments, and conditions as the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds, notes, or other obligations may permit or provide. The terms, provisions, covenants, assignments, and conditions contained in or provided or permitted by any resolution of the board authorizing the issuance of such bonds, notes, or other obligations shall bind the board members of the district then in office and their successors. 
                  (d)  The board shall have power from time to time and whenever it deems it expedient to refund any bonds by the issuance of new bonds, whether or not the bonds to be refunded have matured, and may issue bonds partly to refund bonds then outstanding and partly for any other purpose permitted under this Act. The refunding bonds may be exchanged for the bonds to be refunded, with such cash adjustments as may be agreed upon, or may be sold and the proceeds applied to the purchase or redemption of the bonds to be refunded. 
                  (e)  There shall be no limitation upon the interest rates or any maximum interest rate or rates on any bonds, notes, or other obligations of the district; and the usury laws of this state shall not apply to bonds, notes, or other obligations of the district. 
                  (f)  Bonds issued by the district shall be fully registered and may be subject to such exchangeability and transferability provisions as the bond resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or any indenture or trust agreement may provide. 
                  (g)  Bonds shall bear a certificate of validation. The signature of the clerk of the Superior Court of Forsyth County may be made on the certificate of validation of such bonds by facsimile or by manual execution, stating the date on which such bonds were validated; and such entry shall be original evidence of the fact of judgment and shall be received as original evidence in any court in this state. 
                  (h)  In lieu of specifying the rate or rates of interest which such bonds are to bear and the principal amount and maturities of such said bonds, the notice to the district attorney or the Attorney General, the notice to the public of the time, place, and date of the validation hearing, and the petition and complaint for validation may state that the bonds when issued will bear interest at a rate not exceeding a maximum per annum rate of interest (which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time) and that the principal amount will not exceed and the final maturity date will not be later than as specified in such notices and petition and complaint or may state that, in the event the bonds are to bear different rates of interest for different maturity dates, none of such rates will exceed the maximum rate (which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time) so specified; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting or restricting the right of a board to sell such bonds at a discount, even if in doing so the effective interest cost resulting therefrom would exceed the maximum per annum interest rate specified in such notices and in the petition and complaint. 
                  (i)  The terms "cost of the project" and "cost of any project" shall have the meaning prescribed in this Act whenever those terms are referred to in bond resolutions of a board, in bonds, notes, or other obligations of the district, or in notices of proceedings to validate such bonds, notes, or other obligations of the district. 
                  Section 12. - Authorized contents of agreements and instruments of the board generally; use of proceeds of sale of bonds, notes, or other obligations; subsequent issues of bonds, notes, or other obligations. 
                  (a)  Subject to the limitations and procedures provided by this section and by the immediately preceding section, the agreements or instruments executed by the board may contain such provisions not inconsistent with law as shall be determined by the board. 
                  (b)  The proceeds derived from the sale of all bonds, notes, and other obligations issued by the district shall be held and used for the ultimate purpose of paying, directly or indirectly as permitted in this Act, all or part of the cost of any project, or for the purpose of refunding any bonds, notes, or other obligations issued in accordance under this Act. 
                  (c)  Issuance by the board of one or more series of bonds, notes, or other obligations for one or more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds, notes, or other obligations in connection with the same project or with any other project; but the proceeding wherein any subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations are issued shall recognize and protect any prior loan agreement, security agreement, or other agreement or instrument made for any prior issue of bonds, notes, or other obligations, unless in the resolution authorizing such prior issue the right is expressly reserved to the board to issue subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations on a parity with such prior issue. 
                  (d)  Upon the final repayment of any and all bonds, notes, or other obligations of the district issued under this Act, the board shall make an offer to convey all property and facilities of the board and district to Forsyth County.

                  This Act shall be liberally construed to effect the purposes hereof. The offer, sale, or issuance of bonds, notes, or other obligations by a district shall not be subject to regulation under O.C.G.A. title 10, chapter 5, the "Georgia Securities Act of 1973."

                  (1985 Ga. Laws, page 4925) 
                  Section 5. - Revenue bonds. 
                  The authority, or any authority or body which has or which may in the future succeed to the powers, duties, and liabilities vested in the authority created by this Act shall have power and is authorized to provide by resolution for the issuance of negotiable revenue bonds of the authority for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost, as defined in Section 3 of this Act, of any one or more projects. The principal of and interest on such revenue bonds shall be payable solely from the special fund provided in this Act for such payment. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates per annum, shall be payable at such time or times, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding 40 years from their date or dates, and shall be payable in such medium of payment as to both principal and interest as may be determined by the authority, and may be redeemable before maturity, at the option of the authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority in the resolution for the issuance of bonds. 
                  Section 6. - Same; form; denomination; registration; place of payment. 
                  The authority shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest thereon, which may be at any bank or trust company within or outside the state. The bonds may be issued in coupon or registered form, or both, as the authority may determine; and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bond as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest. 
                  Section 7. - Same; signatures; seal. 
                  In case any officer whose signature shall appear on any bonds or whose facsimile signature shall appear on any coupon shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if such officer had remained in office until such delivery. All such bonds shall be signed by the chairman of the authority and the official seal of the authority shall be affixed thereto and attested by the secretary of the authority and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signatures of the chairman and the secretary of the authority. Any coupon may bear the facsimile signatures of such persons and any bond may be signed, sealed, and attested on behalf of the authority by such persons as at the actual time of the execution of such bonds shall be duly authorized or hold the proper office, although at the date of such bonds such person may not have been so authorized or shall not have held such office. 
                  Section 8. - Same; negotiability; exemption from taxation. 
                  All revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall have and are declared by this Act to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the laws of this state. Such bonds, their transfer, and the income therefrom shall be exempt from all taxation within the state. 
                  Section 9. - Same; sale; price; proceeds. 
                  The authority may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interest of the authority. The proceeds derived from the sale of such bonds shall be used solely for the purpose or purposes provided in the resolutions and proceedings authorizing the issuance of such bonds. 
                  Section 10. - Same, interim receipts and certificates or temporary bonds. 
                  Prior to the preparation of any definitive bonds, the authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts, interim certificates, or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter. 
                  Section 11. - Same; replacement of lost or mutilated bonds. 
                  The authority may provide for the replacement of any bonds or coupons which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost. 
                  Section 12. - Same; conditions precedent to issuance. 
                  Such revenue bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things other than those proceedings, conditions, and things which are specified or required by this Act. In the discretion of the authority, revenue bonds of a single issue may be issued for the purpose of any particular project. Any resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this Act shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special meeting of the authority by a majority of its members. 
                  Section 13. - Credit not pledged. 
                  Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of Forsyth County nor a pledge of the faith and credit of said county; but such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund hereinafter provided for and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate said county to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment. All such bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this section. 
                  Section 14. - Trust indenture as security. 
                  In the discretion of the authority, any issuance of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues, and earnings to be received by the authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for the protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair, and insuring of the project, and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor, and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the project affected by such indenture. 
                  Section 15. - To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid. 
                  In the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, the authority shall provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who, or any agency, bank, or trust company which, shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as this Act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide. 
                  Section 16. - Sinking fund. 
                  The revenues, fees, tolls, and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such fees, earnings, and revenues were produced by a particular project for which bonds have been issued unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the authority to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds of the authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or the trust instrument may provide. Such funds so pledged from whatever source received, including funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture into a sinking fund which shall be pledged to and charged with the payment of (1) the interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due, (2) the principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due, (3) the necessary charges of the paying agent for paying principal and interest and other investment charges, and (4) any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as hereinabove provided. The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be maintained as a trust account for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, any surplus moneys in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be canceled and shall not again be issued. 
                  Section 17. - Remedies of bondholders. 
                  Any holder of revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act or any of the coupons appertaining thereto and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Georgia or granted hereunder or under such resolution or trust indenture and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this Act or by such resolution or trust indenture to be performed by the authority or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished.

                  While any of the bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties, or existence of said authority or its officers, employees, or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of such bonds. No other entity, department, agency, or authority will be created which will compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds, nor will the state itself so compete with the authority. The provisions of this Act shall be for the benefit of the authority and the holders of any such bonds and, upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions hereof, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds. 
                  Section 22. - Moneys received considered trust funds.

                  The authority shall also have the authority, where it deems it feasible, to sell its products and services to customers, governmental agencies, or governmental instrumentalities of adjoining states, providing the laws of the adjoining states do not prohibit or tax said activity. 
                  The authority shall not have the authority to construct water lines for the distribution of water directly to customers within any municipality without first obtaining the express written consent of the appropriate governing bodies of said municipality and, likewise, the authority shall not have the authority to construct sewer lines for the collection of waste and sewage directly to customers within any municipality without first obtaining the express written consent of the appropriate governing body of said municipality."

                  (4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ to ____________ " (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code that embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code). 
                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

                  DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

                  Sec. 2-61. - Findings. 
                  (a)  The Constitution of the State of Georgia, approved by the voters of the state in November 1982 and effective July 1, 1983, provides in article IX, section II, paragraph I thereof, that the governing authority of the county may adopt clearly reasonable ordinances, resolutions, and regulations. 
                  (b)  O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20 authorizes counties to enact ordinances for protecting and preserving the public health, safety, and welfare of the population of the unincorporated areas of the county. 
                  (c)  The board of commissioners, desires to exercise its authority in adopting this article. 
                  (d)  It is essential to the proper operation of democratic government that public officials be independent and impartial, that governmental decisions and policy be made in the proper channels of the governmental structure, that public office not be used for private gain other than the remuneration provided by law, and that there be public confidence in the integrity of government. 
                  (e)  The attainment of one or more of these ends is impaired whenever there exists a conflict between the private interests of an elected official or a governmental employee and his duties. 
                  (f)  The public interest, therefore, requires that the law protect against such conflicts of interest and establish appropriate ethical standards with respect to the conduct of elected officials and government employees in situations where conflicts exist. 
                  (g)  It is also essential to the proper operation of government that those best qualified be encouraged to serve the government. Accordingly, legal safeguards against conflicts of interest must be so designed as not unnecessarily or unreasonably to impede the recruitment and retention by the government of those men and women who are best qualified to serve it. 
                  (h)  An essential principle underlying the staffing of our government structure is that its elected officials and employees should not be denied the opportunity, available to all other citizens, to acquire and retain private economic and other interests, except where conflicts with the responsibility of such elected officials and employees to the public cannot be avoided. 
                  (i)  In recognition of these goals and principles, it is the policy of the board of commissioners to institute, establish, promote, and enforce standards of ethical conduct for all of the county's officers and employees. 
                  (j)  It is a further policy of the board of commissioners that the proper administration of the county's government and the promotion and enforcement of standards of ethical conduct for the county's officers and employees would be best served by the creation of a county ethics panel for the investigation of complaints related to ethical standards.

                  (1)  Any person may file a complaint alleging a violation of any of the provisions of this Code of Ethics by submitting it to the ethics panel clerk. A copy of such complaint shall be immediately delivered by hand, facsimile or email to the county official or employee against whom the complaint was filed with a second copy being provided to the county office or employee by registered mail. The complaint must be supported by affidavits based on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein. All documents referred to in an affidavit should be attached to the affidavit. The person filing the complaint shall verify the complaint by his signature thereon. Every ethics complaint shall be signed and notarized, and shall contain the following statement: 
                  "I have read the ethics complaint and aver that the facts contained therein are true to the best of my knowledge and belief." 
                  The complaint must contain the full legal name of the complainant along with a current valid mailing address, phone number, and, if applicable, an email address. 
                  A complaint must be filed within six months of the date the alleged violation is said to have occurred, or in case of concealment or nondisclosure within six months of the date the alleged violation should have been discovered after due diligence. If the ethics panel clerk makes an initial determination that a complaint is technically deficient, the ethics panel clerk shall submit a list of the deficiencies to the complainant and offer the complainant the opportunity to correct the deficiencies within seven days prior to the complaint being dismissed on technical grounds. For purposes of this Code of Ethics, "technical deficiencies" shall mean that the complaint is not supported by affidavits based on personal knowledge, is not signed and notarized, pertains to conduct occurring more than six months prior to the complaint being filed or contains no statement that the conduct was concealed or non-disclosed, or does not contain the full legal name, mailing address, or phone number of the complaining party. Unremedied technical deficiencies shall authorize the ethics panel clerk to dismiss the complaint. 
                  (2)  Upon receipt of a complaint alleging misconduct, the county official or employee against whom the complaint was filed may reply to the complaint within 30 days, unless such time for reply is extended by the ethics panel upon good cause shown. The response of the county official or employee must be supported by affidavits based on personal knowledge, must set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and must show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein. All documents referred to in an affidavit should be attached to the affidavit. 
                  (3)  Within 60 days of receipt of a complaint, the ethics panel shall conduct an investigatory review to determine whether specific substantiated evidence from a creditable source(s) exits to support a reasonable belief that there has been a violation of this Code of Ethics. In addition to any notice required under the Georgia Open Meetings Act, the clerk shall provide written notice to the party tendering the complaint, and the official or employee that is the subject of the complaint, of the date, time and location of the ethics panel meeting where the investigatory review is to be conducted. This notice shall be provided via statutory overnight or certified mail delivered to the residence or other provided address of the respective party, with said notice to be received a reasonable time and in no event less than two days prior to the date of said meeting. The above notice notwithstanding, neither the complaining nor responding party shall be entitled to make a presentation or otherwise address the ethics panel during the investigatory review meeting. The opportunity for presenting evidence and otherwise addressing the ethics panel shall occur in accord with subsection (4) of this section. If after reviewing the complaint the ethics panel by majority vote determines that no specific, substantiated evidence from a credible source(s) exists to support a reasonable belief that there has been a violation of this Code of Ethics or determines that no violation occurred, it may dismiss the complaint without further proceedings. In the event a complaint is dismissed based upon the merits of the complaint, the complaint may not be re-filed. 
                  (4)  If the ethics panel determines that specific, substantiated evidence from a creditable source exists to support a reasonable belief that there has been a violation of this Code of Ethics, certified written notice of a hearing, containing the time, date and place of such hearing, shall be given to each party by the ethics panel, and a formal public hearing shall be conducted and both parties afforded an opportunity to be heard. Any formal public hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements of due process. The ethics panel is authorized to swear witnesses. 
                  (5)  Any final determination resulting from the hearing shall include written findings of fact and conclusions of law. The ethics panel shall determine if clear and convincing evidence shows any violation of this Code of Ethics. 
                  (6)  In the event an ethics complaint brought against a county official or employee (both hereafter referred to as "respondent") arising out of their official duties is dismissed, the respondent shall be entitled to reimbursement for reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred in defending said ethics complaint. Upon securing a final determination by the ethics panel of the complaint being dismissed, the respondent shall submit a copy of the order making such findings to the Forsyth County Manager along with a copy of all applicable itemized attorneys' fees and costs incurred in defending same. The itemized attorney's fees and costs shall have attorney time and tasks broken down in 1/10 of an hour increments along with the attorney's hourly fee, paralegal costs and all other itemized costs coupled with a sworn statement by the attorney that the amount submitted for repayment is the same amount for which the Respondent would otherwise have been responsible. No paralegal or other expenses shall be subject to reimbursement. 
                  The county manager shall submit, within three business days of receipt, the attorney fee statement to the county attorney for a determination of reasonableness, of which determination shall be provided in writing (or email) to the county manager and respondent within business days. Upon the fees being deemed reasonable, the county manager shall submit all documentation to the department of finance for issuance of a reimbursement check to the respondent or respondent's attorney, at respondent's sole discretion, with reimbursement payment occurring within ten days from the date of the county attorneys' determination notification. In no event shall reimbursement under this paragraph exceed $10,000.00.

                  (d)  The applicant, whether it be an individual, a partnership, a limited liability company, a corporation, a nonprofit tax exempt civic, patriotic, or social club, or a private club, shall be the owner of the premises for which the license is held or the holder of the lease thereon for the period covered by the license.

Said tax shall be paid by the licensee to the county, and remitted monthly by said licensee. The imposition of this tax shall be administered pursuant to the following rules and regulations. 
                  (a)  Every licensee or his agent is hereby authorized and directed to collect the tax imposed herein from purchasers of alcoholic beverages by the drink within the licensed premises. Such licensee or agent shall furnish such information as may be required by the director to facilitate the collection of the tax. 
                  (b)  If requested by the purchaser, every licensee for the sale of alcoholic beverages by the drink shall at the time of collection for food and drinks served give to the purchaser a receipt on which the purchase price and tax imposed by this article on alcoholic beverages by the drink shall be itemized separately. In all cases where the collection of food and drinks is by deferred payment or credit, the licensee is liable at the time of, and to the extent that such credits are incurred in accordance with the rate of tax owing on the amount thereof. The Director and the board of commissioners shall have the authority to adopt rules and regulations prescribing methods and schedules for the collection and payment of the tax. 
                  (c)  The taxes imposed by this section shall become due and payable from the purchaser at the time of purchase of any alcoholic beverage by the drink in this county. The full amount of such taxes collected by the licensee shall be due and payable to the county monthly, on or before the 20th day of the month following each monthly period a return for the preceding monthly period shall be filed with the finance department in such form as the director may prescribe by every licensee liable for the payment of tax hereunder; all returns shall show the gross receipt from the sale of alcoholic beverages by the drink and the amount of the tax collected on such drinks. 
                  (d)  If the director has cause to believe that the return, or the amount of tax required to be paid to the county by any licensee in not proper, her my compute and determine the amount required to be paid upon the basis of any information that is available to him. Should the county determine that a deficiency exists in the amount of the tax due by the licensee for one or more monthly periods, the amount of the deficiency shall bear interest at the rate of one and one-half percent per month, or fraction thereof from the due date of taxes. The director or his designated representative shall give to the licensee written notice of this deficiency determination, and notice may be served by the Forsyth County Sheriff's Office or by mail; if by mail such service shall be addressed to the registered agent of the licensee. Service by mail is complete when delivered by certified mail with a receipt signed by the addressee or by receipt of mailing. Except in the case of failure to make a return, every notice of a deficiency determination shall be mailed within three years after the 20th day of the calendar month following the monthly period for which the amount is proposed to be determined, or within three years after the return is filed, whichever period should last expire. 
                  (e)  If any licensee fails to make a return, the director shall make an estimate of the amounts of the gross receipts of the licensee, or as the case may be, the amount of the total sales within the county which are subject to the tax. The estimate shall be made for the period or periods in respect to which the person failed to make the return, and shall be based upon any information which is available to the director. Written notice shall be given in the manner prescribed in the preceding paragraph. The amount of the determination shall bear interest at the rate of one and one-half percent per month, or fraction thereof, from the 20th day of the month following the monthly period for which the amount or any portion thereof would have been returned until the date of payment. 
                  (f)  Any licensee who fails to pay the tax herein imposed, or fails to pay any amount of tax required to be collected ad paid to the county within the time required, shall pay a penalty or 20 percent of the tax or amount of the tax in addition to the tax or amount of the tax plus interest on the unpaid tax or any portion thereof as set forth in the preceding section. 
                  (g)  At any time within three years after any tax, or any amount of tax required to be collected becomes due and payable, and at any time within three years after the delinquency of any tax, or any amount of tax required to be collected, the county may bring an action in the courts of this state, of any other state, or of the United States to collect the amount delinquent, together with penalties and interest, court fees, filing fees, attorney's fees, and other legal fees incident thereto. Whenever the amount of any tax, penalty, or interest has been paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the county under this chapter, it may be offset against any future liability for the tax. If the licensee determines that he has overpaid or paid more than once, which fact has not been determined by the director, he will have three years from the date of payment to file a claim in writing, stating the specific ground upon which his claim is founded. The claim shall be audited. If the claim is approved by the director, the excess amount paid to the county may be credited on any amounts then due and payable from the licensee, or may be refunded to the licensee if the licensee is no longer operation a licensed premises in the county. 
                  (h)  The director and/or the Forsyth County Finance Department shall administer and enforce the provisions of this section for the collection of the tax imposed by this section. Every licensee for the sale of alcoholic beverages by the drink in the county shall keep such records, receipts, invoices, and other pertinent papers in such forms as the director may require. The director or any person authorized in writing by the board of commissioners may examine the books, papers, records, financial reports, equipment, and other facilities of any licensee liable for the tax in order to verify the accuracy of any return made, or if no return is made by the licensee, to ascertain and determine the amount required to be paid. In the administration of the provision of this section, the director may require the filing of the reports by any person or class of persons having in such person's or possession or custody information relating to the purchases which are subject to the tax. The report shall be filed with the director and shall set forth the purchase price for each purchase, the date or dates of purchase and such other information as the director may require. The licensee shall keep a copy of this chapter at the outlet at all times. All employees of the licensee will be informed of the contents of this section. 
                  (i)  Any person violating any of the provisions of this section shall be deemed guilty of an offense and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine and/or imprisonment. Each such person shall be guilty of a separate offense for each and every day during any portion of which any violation of any provision of this section is committed, continued, or permitted by such person and shall be punished accordingly. Any licensee or any other person who fails to furnish any return required to be made, or fails or refuses to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the director, or who renders a false or fraudulent return shall be deemed guilty of an offense and upon conviction thereof, shall be punished as aforesaid.

                  (a)  "In-room service" is the provision of a cabinet or other facility located in a hotel-motel guest room which contains beer, wine, and/or distilled spirits and which is provided upon written request of the guest and which is accessible by lock and key only to the guest and for which the sale of beer, wine, and/or distilled spirits contained therein is final at the time requested except for a credit which may be given to the guest for any unused portion.

                  Sec. 6-143. - Nude dancing; findings; public purpose. 
                  Based on the experience of other urban counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; and Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida, which experiences we believe are relevant to the problems faced by Forsyth County, Georgia, we take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the finding of the board of commissioners that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment," begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increase burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity. To that end, this section 6-143 is hereby adopted. 
                  (a)  Enactment. The following types of entertainment, attire and conduct are prohibited upon any premises licensed to sell, serve or dispense alcohol beverages for consumption on such premises within the unincorporated area of Forsyth County: 
                  (1)  The employment or use of any person, in any capacity, in the sale or service of alcohol beverages while such person is unclothed or in such attire, costume or clothing, as to expose to view any portion of the female breast below the top of the areola or of any portion of the male or female pubic hair, anus, cleft of the buttocks, vulva and genitals. 
                  (2)  Live entertainment where any person appears in the manner described in subsection (1) of this section or where such persons (or person) perform(s) acts of or acts which simulate any of the following: 
                  a.  Sexual intercourse, masturbation, sodomy, bestiality, oral copulation, flagellation or any sexual act which is prohibited by law. 
                  b.  The caressing or fondling of the breasts, buttocks, anus or genitals. 
                  c.  The displaying of the male or female pubic hair, anus, vulva or genitals. 
                  (3)  The holding, promotion, sponsoring or allowance of any contest, promotion, special night, event or any other activity where patrons of the license establishment are encouraged or allowed to engage in any of the conduct described in subsections (1) and (2) above; provided, however, that nothing shall apply to the premises of any mainstream performance house, museum or theater which derives less than 20 percent of its gross annual income from the sale of alcoholic beverages.

                  (e)  Brewpubs must pay all applicable county taxes. 
                  (f)  Brewpubs shall be required to obtain an on premise consumption license for those sales of malt beverages for consumption on premises. Brewpubs shall be required to obtain a package sales license to authorize the retail sale of growlers.

                  Sec. 10-31. - Purpose and intent. 
                  (a)  It is the intent and purpose of this article to regulate the place of operation of adult entertainment establishments as defined herein. This article is intended to be a carefully tailored regulation to minimize the adverse land use impacts caused by the undesirable secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments. The Board of Commissioners of Forsyth County finds that restricting adult entertainment establishments to industrially zoned areas and imposing development standards can legitimately regulate such establishments by delineating zones where adult entertainment establishments are most compatible with other uses and the surrounding neighborhood. The board also finds that requiring minimum distances to be maintained between adult entertainment establishment uses and other uses will afford the most protection to residential uses. It is not the intent or purpose of the board of commissioners, in enacting this article, to deny any person's right to speech, conduct or expression protected by the United States or Georgia Constitutions. In the enactment of this article, the board intends to adopt a content neutral measure to address the secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments. 
                  (b)  The board of commissioners finds, based on a 1984 study entitled Adult Entertainment Business in Indianapolis, that areas with sexually oriented businesses have higher crime rates than similar areas with no sexually oriented business. Specifically, the board finds that the study reveals that sex-related crimes, defined in the study as rape, indecent exposure, obscene conduct, child molestation, adult molestation, and commercial sex, are much more prevalent in areas where adult entertainment is offered than in areas where no adult entertainment is offered. The same finding is true as to the occurrences of major crimes. 
                  (c)  The board of commissioners further finds, based on a May 19, 1986 study from Austin, Texas, entitled Report on Adult Oriented Businesses in Austin, that a severe decline in residential property values may be precipitated by the presence of an adult entertainment establishment, particularly where that adult entertainment establishment is located within one block of residential property uses. Furthermore, the board finds that there is an indication that the introduction of adult entertainment establishments into areas of family-oriented, owner-occupied residential neighborhoods may precipitate a transition to a more transient, renter-occupied neighborhood, which leads to depressed property values and urban blight. 
                  (d)  The board of commissioners further finds, based on an October 1980 study of the Minnesota Crime Prevention Center, Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota, entitled An Analysis of the Relationship Between Adult Entertainment Establishments, Crime and Housing Values, that adult businesses do have a significant and consistent positive correlation with the crime rate index and a negative correlation with the mean single-family housing value. The board of commissioners also finds, based on this study, that adult entertainment businesses should be permitted only in locations that are at least 1,500 feet, from residential areas and that adult entertainment businesses should not be placed adjacent to one another. 
                  (e)  The board of commissioners further finds, based on a June 1978 study from St. Paul, Minnesota, entitled Effects on Surrounding Area of Adult Entertainment Businesses in Saint Paul, that the presence of adult entertainment establishments correlates statistically with poor neighborhood conditions. The board of commissioners finds based on this study that the location of adult entertainment establishments correlates significantly with neighborhood blight and deterioration. 
                  (f)  Moreover, it is the finding of the board of commissioners that public nudity, either partial or total, under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages, leads to an increase in the surrounding area of criminal behavior and creates undesirable community conditions, blight and diminution in property values.

The issuance of such an annual license shall not be deemed to authorize, condone or make legal any activity thereunder if the same is deemed illegal or unlawful under the laws of the state or the United States.

Applications for renewal must be filed before November 30 of each year.

If a license renewal application is received after January 1, such application shall be treated as an initial application and the applicant shall be required to comply with all rules and regulations for the granting of licenses as if no previous license had been held.

                  Sec. 14-31. - Running at large prohibited. 
                  (a)  It shall be the duty of the owner of any animal or anyone having an animal in his possession to keep the animal under control at all times while the animal is off the real property limits of the owner, possessor or custodian. For the purposes of this section, an animal is deemed under control when it is confined within a vehicle; is secured by a leash or other device held by a competent person; is under voice control; or is properly confined within an enclosure with permission of the owner of the property where the enclosure is located. 
                  (b)  No person shall tie, stake or fasten any animal within any street, alley, sidewalk or other public place or in such manner that the animal has access to any portion of any street, alley, sidewalk or other public place.

                  (c)  For purposes of this section 14-32, a dog handler shall be considered a person who, for compensation, trains, conditions, and shows dogs in competition.

                  (e)  Once impounded, an animal shall be kept for a period of time as outlined in this article, and, thereafter, if the animal is not claimed by anyone after a reasonable effort has been made to locate the owner, possessor or custodian of the animal as provided in this article, the animal may be disposed of in a humane fashion or in accordance with the rules and regulations of the state.

                  (1)  If the animal is not claimed by the owner within five days of being telephoned or personally contacted or seven days of a notice being left at the owners residence, the animal shall be deemed abandoned and representatives of the animal control shelter may at their discretion adopt such animal or dispose of such animal in accordance with state law.

In such event, the owner will be responsible for all costs associated with the spay-neuter procedure. If an owner does not comply with the agreement, upon confirmation of same the dog or cat shall be surrendered to the county upon such terms as are set forth in the agreement and as otherwise required by pertinent animal shelter policies. 
                  (c)  The requirement set forth in section 14-77(b) shall not apply if the owner of the dog or cat claims or presents evidence that such dog or cat is the property of such person or organization.

In any case, a minimum of a dual check valve will be required in any new construction. 
                  (2)  For premises existing prior to the start of this program, the department will perform evaluations and inspections of plans and/or premises and inform the owner by letter of any corrective action deemed necessary, the method of achieving the correction, and time allowed for the correction to be made. Ordinarily, 90 days will be allowed; however, this time period may be shortened depending upon the degree of hazard involved and the history of the device in question. 
                  (3)  The department will not allow any cross connection to remain unless it is protected by an approved backflow preventer for which a permit has been installed and which will be regularly tested to ensure satisfactory operation. 
                  (4)  The department shall inform the owner by letter of any failure to comply by the time of the first reinspection. The department will allow an additional 15 days for the correction. If the owner fails to comply with the necessary correction by the time of the second reinspection, the department will inform the owner by letter that the water service to the owner's premises will be terminated within a period not to exceed five days. If the owner informs the department of extenuating circumstances as to why the correction has not been made, a time extension may be granted by the department but in no case will exceed an additional 30 days. 
                  (5)  If the department determines at any time that a serious threat to the public health exists, the water service will be terminated immediately.

                  Sec. 18-140. - Periodic testing. 
                  (a)  Reduced pressure principle backflow devices shall be tested and inspected at least semi-annually. 
                  (b)  Periodic testing shall be performed by the department's certified tester or his delegated representative. This testing will be done at the owner's expense. 
                  (c)  The testing shall be conducted during the department's regular business hours. Exceptions to this, when at the request of the owner, may require additional charges to cover the increased costs to the department. 
                  (d)  Any backflow preventer which fails during a periodic test will be repaired or replaced. When repairs are necessary, upon completion of the repair the device will be retested at owner's expense to ensure correct operation. High hazard situations will not be allowed to continue unprotected if the backflow preventer fails the test and cannot be repaired immediately. In other situations, a compliance date of not more than 30 days after the test date will be established. The owner is responsible for spare parts, repair tools, or a replacement device. Parallel installation of two devices is an effective means of the owner ensuring the uninterrupted water service during testing or repair of devices and is strongly recommended when the owner desires such continuity. 
                  (e)  Backflow prevention devices will be tested more frequently than specified in subsection (a) of this section in cases where there is a history of test failures and the department feels that due to the degree of hazard involved, additional testing is warranted. Cost of the additional test will be borne by the owner.

                  (b)  The Director of the Forsyth County Department of Water and Sewer ("department"), and his authorized agent or representative, shall be the enforcement authority for this subsection. The board of commissioners may also authorize other county departments as may be deemed necessary to support enforcement by the director. 
                  (c)  Unless otherwise specified or ordered by the board of commissioners, violators of this article or other water use restrictions issued by the department or the board of commissioners shall be subject to the following schedule of administrative penalties to the extent that violations occur within a 24-month period: 
                  (1)  First violation. Written notice delivered by one of the following methods: (a) posting at the property, (b) hand delivery or (c) by sending both regular and certified mail to the property where the violation occurred. The notice shall be in writing and shall include the address of where the violation occurred, a description of the violation, and notification of the consequences of subsequent violations. 
                  (2)  Second violation. $100.00 administrative penalty placed upon water bill of customer's property where violation occurred. 
                  (3)  Third violation. $500.00 administrative penalty placed upon water bill of the service address where violation occurred. 
                  (4)  Fourth and subsequent violations. $1,000.00 administrative penalty placed upon the water bill of the service address where violation occurred and service termination, plus applicable charges for reconnection of service. 
                  (d)  Notice. In addition to delivering a first violation notice to the property as provided in section 18-185(c)(1) above, notices of violation for the first violation and all subsequent violations of the restrictions in this article or issued pursuant to this article shall be sent by regular and by certified mail to the customer of record at the customer's billing address. In the event the certified mail is declined by the customer, proof of this decline shall be maintained and the customer shall be deemed to have received the notice on the date of declination. The notice shall be in writing, include the address of where the violation occurred, a description of the violation, and the consequences of subsequent violations. The notice may order that the violation be corrected, cured, or abated immediately or within such specified time as the department determines is reasonable under the circumstances. In the case of multi-family residential dwellings where two or more units are served by a single meter, written notice shall be mailed to the person in whose name the water bill is issued and administrative penalties shall be assessed accordingly. 
                  (e)  Any administrative penalties imposed pursuant to this section may, at the discretion of the department director under extraordinary circumstances, be waived or reduced. 
                  (f)  Any administrative penalties imposed pursuant to this section shall be payable to the department as part of the customer's regular bill for water service and shall not be affected by the filing of any appeal. Failure to remit payment in full as required under this section and the customer's service agreement will subject the customer to a termination of service. 
                  (g)  Any customer aggrieved or adversely affected by an administrative penalty imposed pursuant to this ordinance shall have an opportunity to request and be given a hearing before the Forsyth County Zoning Board of Appeals, wherein the aggrieved or adversely affected customer shall have an opportunity to show cause as to why an administrative penalty or other enforcement action under this ordinance should not be taken. Such request shall be made in writing and delivered to the department director, accompanied by a $50.00 administrative processing fee, within ten days of the date of receipt of the notice of violation via certified mail; or, in the event that certified mail is declined, within ten days of the date of such declination. 
                  (h)  Criminal and alternative penalties. Any violation of this section may alternatively be enforced by a citation or accusation returnable to the magistrate court of the county pursuant to section 1-12 of the County Code or by any other legal means as set forth in this article. Utilization of a citation to magistrate court shall be in lieu of the imposition of an administrative penalty placed upon the water bill. However, in the event that a magistrate court hearing results in a finding of guilty, said finding of guilt shall count against the customer for purposes of assessing cumulative fines during any 24-month period. 
                  (i)  Notwithstanding and in addition to the foregoing, abatement of any nuisance occurring under this article may be handled as authorized and using the procedures established in article VIII of this chapter.

Whenever a request is filed with the public officer by a public authority or by at least five residents of unincorporated Forsyth County charging that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the Public Officer shall make an investigation or inspection of the specific dwelling, building, structure or property. 
                  (b)  Issuance of notice or filing of complaint. If the public officer's investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer shall notify the board of commissioners of such finding and shall either issue a 30-day notice to comply or file a complaint in rem as indicated below. 
                  (c)  Issuance of 30-day notice.

The notice shall instruct the owner to repair, alter, improve, vacate and close or demolish said dwelling, building, structure, or property within 30 days of the date the notice is mailed via regular delivery. 
                  (d)  Filing a complaint. If the dwelling, building, structure or property is not repaired, altered, improved, vacated and closed or demolished within 30 days, or, if the public official determines that it is in the best interest of the county to proceed without first issuing a 30-day notice, the public official may issue a complaint in rem against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general nuisance exists and shall cause summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the interested parties for such dwelling, building, structure, or property. 
                  (e)  Contents of complaint. The complaint shall: 
                  (1)  Identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference;

                  (3)  State with particularity the factual basis for the action; and 
                  (4)  Contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. Unless specifically authorized by the board of commissioners, demolition shall not be sought for any dwelling, building, structure or property that is occupied or has exceptional historical, architectural or social uniqueness or significance. 
                  (f)  Service of complaint. Complaints issued by a public officer shall be served in the following manner: 
                  (1)  At least 14 days prior to the date of the hearing, the public officer shall mail copies of the complaint by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery, return receipt requested, to all interested parties whose identities and addresses are reasonably ascertainable. Copies of the complaint shall also be mailed by first-class mail to the property address to the attention of the occupants of the property, if any, and shall be posted on the property within three business days of filing the complaint and at least 14 days prior to the date of the hearing. 
                  (2)  For interested parties whose mailing address is unknown, a notice stating the date, time, and place of the hearing shall be published in the newspaper in which the sheriff s advertisements appear in such county once a week for two consecutive weeks prior to the hearing. 
                  (3)  At the time of filing the complaint in the Forsyth County Magistrate Court, a notice of lis pendens shall be filed in the office of the Forsyth County Clerk of Superior Court. Such notice shall have the same force and effect as other lis pendens notices provided by law. 
                  (4)  Orders and other filings made subsequent to service of the initial complaint shall be served in the manner described above on any interested party who answers the complaint or appears at the hearing. Any interested party who fails to answer or appear at the hearing shall be deemed to have waived all further notice in the proceedings. 
                  (g)  Issuance of summons; hearing. The summons shall notify the owner and other interested parties that a hearing will be held before the Forsyth County Magistrate Court, at the date and time certain and at a place within Forsyth County. Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days nor more than 45 days after the filing of said complaint in the proper court. The owner and other interested parties shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for hearing. 
                  (h)  Issuance of order by court. If, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building, structure, or property in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state in writing findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order requiring any building, dwelling, structure, or property to be repaired, altered, improved, vacated, closed and/or demolished in accordance with the following: 
                  (1)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, structure, or property can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, structure, or property, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, structure, or property so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  (2)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, structure, or property in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, structure, or property, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to vacate and close or demolish and remove such dwelling, building, structure, or property and all debris from the property. 
                  For the purposes of this section, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, structure, or property" without consideration of the value of the land on which a structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure or property to bring it into compliance may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with the Georgia appraiser classification as provided in Chapter 39A of Title 43, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure or property shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure or property into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in Forsyth County. 
                  (i)  Noncompliance with the order. If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, vacate and close, or demolish and remove the dwelling, building, structure, or property, the public officer or his designee may cause such dwelling, building, structure, or property to be repaired, altered, or improved or to be vacated and closed or demolished. Such abatement action shall commence within 270 days after the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action must commence. The public officer, or his designee, shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, structure, or property a placard with the following words: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (j)  Demolition procedure. If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and Forsyth County Board of Commissioners are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
                  (k)  Recovery of costs of abatement. The amount of the cost of repair, closure or demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the county tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
                  Said lien shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the Forsyth County Clerk of Superior Court and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12(c). The Forsyth County Clerk of Superior Court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien in the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. 
                  After filing a certified copy of the order with the Forsyth County Clerk of Superior Court and final determination of costs, fees, and expenses incurred in accordance with this section, the public officer shall transmit to the county tax commissioner a statement of the total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all notices provided to interested parties. The statement of the public officer shall be transmitted within 90 days of completion of the repairs, demolition, or closure. 
                  It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner, who is responsible or whose duties include the collection of county taxes, to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. tit. 48, ch. 4; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The county tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the Board of Commissioners for Forsyth County. 
                  Enforcement of liens pursuant to this section may be initiated at any time following receipt by the county tax commissioner of the final determination of costs in accordance with this section. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. An enforcement proceeding pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this section. 
                  The redemption amount in any enforcement proceeding pursuant to this section shall be the full amount of the costs as finally determined in accordance with this section together with interest, penalties, and costs incurred by the governing authority and county tax commissioner in the enforcement of such lien. Redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. 
                  If legally possible and the property is still in existence, the board of commissioners may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the county agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, structure, or property on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
                  (l)  Appeal; injunction. Review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, closure or demolition of a dwelling, building, structure, or property shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under Code section 5-3-29. 
                  Any person affected by an order issued by the public officer may petition to the Forsyth County Superior Court for an injunction restraining the Public Officer from carrying out the provisions of the order, and the court may, upon such petition, issue a temporary injunction restraining the public officer pending the final disposition of the cause; provided, however, that such person shall present such petition to the court within 15 days of the posting and service of the order of the public officer. De novo hearings shall be held by the court on petitions within 20 days. The court shall hear and determine the issues raised and shall enter such final order or decree as law and justice may require; provided, however, that it shall not be necessary to file bond in any amount before obtaining a temporary injunction under this section.

                  (a)  The public officer may post a notice of non-compliance and of actions taken by code enforcement officials or the court with respect thereto, and the fixing of penalties for the defacing, destruction, or removal of such notices; provided that no such notices shall be posted on any property then designated by proper governmental authority for acquisition by eminent domain.

Instead, this article is intended to balance competing interests, reduce criminal activity and protect county citizens from abusive sales techniques versus the conduct of proper commercial sales activity. This article is not intended to allow any business activity which would otherwise be unlawful.

                  (b)  The dealer shall obtain from each person selling any article, the fingerprint (using an electronic digital fingerprint scanner) of the right hand index finger, unless such finger is missing, in which event the print of the next finger in existence on the right hand shall be obtained with a notation as to the exact finger printed.

                  ARTICLE VI. - MASSAGE AND SPA ESTABLISHMENTS 

                  Sec. 22-223. - Purpose and legislative findings. 
                  The Georgia General Assembly has declared that the licensed practice of massage therapy by health care professionals is an activity affecting and benefiting the public interest and involving the health, safety, and welfare of the public but that the illegal and illicit practice of physical and bodily manipulation by a person who is not licensed under the Georgia Massage Therapy Practice Act (O.C.G.A. §§ 43-24A-1, et seq.) is a public nuisance, harmful to the public health, safety, and welfare. The board of commissioners agrees with those findings. Furthermore, the board of commissioners finds that, for some massage establishments, the business in fact is sexual conduct or the intimation of sexual conduct, rather than lawful massage therapy. Such establishments offer massage services as a subterfuge for prostitution, masturbation for hire, and other paid sexual contact, which are harmful to the public health, safety, and welfare. There is difficulty and expense in conclusively distinguishing between such establishments and legitimate massage or spa establishments by licensed or certified health care professionals, but one criteria that may assist in distinguishing a legitimate versus illegitimate operator is whether the establishment has a relationship with a corporate or franchising hierarchy, which would tend to provide a check against unlawful sexual activities on the massage establishment premises because illegal activity would have repercussions on the corporate/franchise affiliation. The recitation of this criterion is not intended to impugn the integrity or motivation of the many wholly-independent, legitimate providers; it is simply one of many factors that may be legitimately considered. It is a purpose of this article to impose county licensing requirements to help prevent illegal massage, prostitution, sex trafficking and related sex crimes, without hindering legitimate massage or spa establishments operating under a business structure with external oversight that serves that purpose. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 43-24A-22 (allowing local regulation of massage businesses and of persons not licensed by the state), it is the purpose of this article to regulate the operation of massage and spa establishments, and to regulate employees of such establishments who are not licensed as massage therapists by the state, as an exercise of the county's police power in order to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the county. 
                  (Ord. No. 124, § 1, 11-5-2015)

                  (c)  Licenses and work permits issued before the adoption of this article shall continue in effect for their original terms, subject to the regulations herein, including the provisions in section 22-232 as amended.

An exemption under this subsection expires on December 31 of the year for which it was granted. Upon the expiration of an exemption, the establishment and its employees are subject to all requirements of sections 22-227, 22-228, and 22-229. Any request for an exemption shall be submitted in writing to the sheriff. The request for an exemption is automatically rejected unless the sheriff grants the exemption.

                  (5)  Whether the establishment is operated by a person who has been continually licensed pursuant to the Georgia Massage Therapy Practice Act for at least four years. The four-year consideration evidences that a licensed individual has secured and maintained the license for a reasonable duration. However, possessing a license for less than four years shall not automatically preclude receipt of an exemption.

                  Sec. 22-259. - Schedule of criteria. 
                  The board of commissioners and development authority shall adopt a schedule of criteria that identifies selected target business and establishes the minimum criteria for eligibility for inducements for each target industry that includes but is not limited to: Minimum number of jobs created, minimum average salary compared that of the county average for that industry, minimum net present value of the estimated fiscal impact as determined by a fiscal analysis to be conducted by the Cumming-Forsyth County Chamber of Commerce. The schedule shall be adopted by the board of commissioners and the development authority by June 30 each year for the following fiscal year. Failure by the board of commissioners and/or the development authority to adopt an updated schedule for any particular fiscal year shall in no way abrogate any inducement provided to a target business so long as the inducement is consistent with the last-approved schedule. In order to be eligible for inducements, a Targeted Business shall also meet the following criteria: 
                  (1)  The targeted business must not be located within a designated redevelopment area. 
                  (2)  A targeted business shall be required to contract with the county to meet the fiscal impact requirements of this section. The county manager is hereby authorized to execute the contract referenced herein, but any such contracts shall be placed upon an agenda of the board of commissioners for ratification and shall not be binding upon Forsyth County until such ratification, as required by Georgia law. 
                  (3)  In order to remain competitive on projects that are also targets for the State of Georgia, the county manager may consider whether the targeted business has or will receive a funding commitment from the State of Georgia contingent upon the business' relocation or expansion within the State of Georgia. The project eligibility for funding from the State of Georgia is often contingent upon a local inducement or other commitment. In determining whether Forsyth County should offer inducements to a targeted business, the county manager may consider factors including, but not limited to, the impact of the targeted business upon infrastructure, traffic generation, water usage, sewer generation, and storm water generation. The final determination whether to offer inducements to a targeted business will be made by the county manager after considering whether such an offer of inducements is in the best interest of Forsyth County. 
                  A targeted business in a designated redevelopment area shall only be eligible for inducements if it meets the following criteria: 
                  (1)  The targeted business shall be required to contract with the county to meet the fiscal impact requirements of this section. The county manager is hereby authorized to execute the contract referenced herein. Any such contract may be placed upon an agenda of the board of commissioners for ratification and shall not be binding as to Forsyth County until such ratification has occurred. 
                  (2)  In order to remain competitive on projects that are also targets for the State of Georgia, the county manager may consider whether the targeted business has or will received a funding commitment from the State of Georgia contingent upon the business' relocation or expansion within the State of Georgia. The project eligibility for funding from the State of Georgia is often contingent upon a local inducement or other commitment. In determining whether Forsyth County should offer inducements to a targeted business, the county manager may consider factors including, but not limited to, the impact of the targeted business upon infrastructure, traffic generation, water usage, sewer generation, and stormwater generation. The final determination whether to offer inducements to a targeted business will be made by the county manager after considering whether such an offer of inducements is in the best interest of Forsyth County. 
                  Any targeted business which receives any inducement under the provisions of this article shall agree not to relocate outside Forsyth County for the entire period during which the inducement is granted and for which the effects of the inducement are executory. Should the targeted business relocate outside Forsyth County during the inducement period, the targeted business shall immediately reimburse Forsyth County or the issuing authority for the full value of any and all inducements received pursuant to this article. This claw back provision shall be a part of every inducement contract. Should the targeted business fail to meet its fiscal impact requirement, income requirement, or employment requirement, any economic inducement offered to the targeted business by Forsyth County or any authority of Forsyth County shall be reduced by 20 percent for the first such year. In the event that the targeted business fails to meet its requirements pursuant to this agreement for more than one year, any economic inducement offered to the targeted business shall be reduced by 50 percent for the second such year. The third year of non-attainment of its requirements pursuant to this agreement shall result in termination of all inducements pursuant to this article.

                  Considering the fact that this county has been richly blessed with the heritage and history of its people who are now deceased; that many of those who have passed on have been memorialized with resting places in cemeteries, graveyards, and burial grounds that have been abandoned, desecrated, neglected, unmarked, and are threatened by unknowing development; and that such abandoned, desecrated, neglected, and unmarked cemeteries, graveyards, and burial grounds are not a befitting tribute to such honorable citizens of the past; therefore, it is the desire of the board of commissioners to provide for the preservation, protection, and maintenance of all such family and community cemeteries, graveyards, and burial grounds.

Within 48 hours, the county coroner, the planning and community development director, and local law enforcement shall determine whether or not the grave is part of a cemetery. If it is determined that the grave is a cemetery, then the planning and community development director shall undertake efforts to identify and preserve the burial ground.

                  --- (2) --- 
                  State Law reference— Georgia Emergency Telephone Number 911 Service Act of 1977, O.C.G.A. § 46-5-120 et seq. 

                  Sec. 30-31. - Findings. 
                  (a)  By virtue of O.C.G.A. § 46-5-133, the governing authority of any local government which operates or which contracts for the operation of an emergency telephone number 911 system is authorized to adopt a resolution to impose a monthly 911 charge upon each exchange access facility subscribed to by telephone subscribers whose exchange access lines are in the areas served or which would be served by the 911 service. 
                  (b)  The board of commissioners has deemed the enhancement of emergency 911 service within the county to be necessary and of the utmost importance in order to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry by shortening the time required for a citizen to request and receive emergency aid as well as the response time to situations requiring law enforcement, fire, medical, rescue, and other emergency services resulting in the saving of lives, a reduction in the destruction of property, and quicker apprehension of criminals. 
                  (c)  Appropriate notice and hearings on this article have been carried out. 
                  (Ord. No. 67, 12-27-1990) 
                  Sec. 30-32. - Monthly 911 service charge. 
                  For the enhancement of emergency 911 service within the county, there shall be imposed a monthly 911 charge upon each exchange access facility subscribed to by telephone subscribers within the county whose exchange access lines are in the areas served or which would be served by the 911 service. 
                  (Ord. No. 67, § 1, 12-27-1990) 
                  Sec. 30-33. - Billing and collection of charges. 
                  The subscriber of an exchange access facility may be billed for the monthly 911 charges imposed with respect to that facility by the service supplier. Such 911 charge may not exceed $1.00 per month per exchange access facility provided to the telephone subscriber. All exchange access facilities billed to federal, state, or local governments shall be exempt from the 911 charge. Each service supplier shall, on behalf of the county, collect the 911 charge from those telephone subscribers to whom it provides exchange telephone service within the county. As part of its normal monthly billing process, the service supplier shall collect the 911 charge as a separate entry on each bill. If a service supplier receives a partial payment for a monthly bill from a telephone subscriber, the service supplier shall apply the payment against the amount the telephone subscriber owes the service supplier first. 
                  (Ord. No. 67, § 2, 12-27-1990; Amendment B, 10-20-2003) 
                  Sec. 30-34. - Liability for charges. 
                  Every telephone subscriber within the county served by the emergency 911 system shall be liable for the 911 charge imposed under this article until it has been paid to the service supplier. A service supplier shall have no obligation to take any legal action to enforce the collection of the 911 charge. The service supplier shall provide the county board of commissioners within 60 days with the name and address of each subscriber who has refused to pay the 911 charge after such 911 charge has become due. A collection action may be initiated by the county, and reasonable costs and attorneys' fees associated with that collection action may be awarded to the county. 
                  (Ord. No. 67, § 3, 12-27-1990) 
                  Sec. 30-35. - Responsibility of county. 
                  The county shall remain ultimately responsible to the service supplier for all emergency 911 system installation, service, equipment, operation, and maintenance charges owed to the service supplier. Any taxes due on emergency 911 system service provided by the service supplier will be billed to the county. State and local taxes do not apply to the 911 charge billed to telephone subscribers under this article. 
                  (Ord. No. 67, § 4, 12-27-1990) 
                  Sec. 30-36. - Retention of administrative fee by service supplier. 
                  Each service supplier that collects 911 charges on behalf of the county is entitled to retain as an administrative fee an amount equal to three percent of the gross 911 charge receipts to be remitted to the county. The remaining amount shall be due quarterly to the county and shall be remitted to it no later than 60 days after the close of a calendar quarter. The 911 charges collected by the service supplier shall be deposited and accounted for in a separate restricted revenue fund known as the emergency telephone system fund maintained by the county. The county may invest the money in the fund in the same manner that other moneys of the local government may be invested and any income earned from such investment shall be deposited in the emergency telephone system fund. 
                  (Ord. No. 67, § 5, 12-27-1990) 
                  Sec. 30-37. - Reaffirmation of necessity for charge. 
                  The board of commissioners shall, by resolution, reaffirm the necessity for the 911 charge beginning with the 13th month following the month in which emergency 911 system service is first provided in the county and during such month annually thereafter. 
                  (Ord. No. 67, § 6, 12-27-1990) 
                  Sec. 30-38. - Reduction of charge. 
                  Such monthly 911 charge may be reduced at any time by the board of commissioners by resolution; provided, however, that such board shall be required to reduce such monthly 911 charge at any time the projected revenues from 911 charges will cause the unexpended revenues in the emergency telephone system fund at the end of the fiscal year to exceed by 1½ times the unexpended revenues in such fund at the end of the immediately preceding fiscal year or at any time the unexpended revenues in such fund at the end of the fiscal year exceed by 1½ times the unexpended revenues in such fund at the end of the immediately preceding fiscal year. Such reduction in the 911 charge shall be in an amount which will avert the accumulation of revenues in such fund at the end of the fiscal year which will exceed by 1½ times the amount of revenues in the fund at the end of the immediately preceding fiscal year. 
                  (Ord. No. 67, § 7, 12-27-1990) 
                  Sec. 30-39. - Use of funds. 
                  Money from the emergency telephone system fund shall be used only to pay for: 
                  (1)  The lease, purchase, or maintenance of emergency telephone equipment, including necessary computer hardware, software, and data base provisioning; addressing; and nonrecurring costs of establishing and enhancing a 911 system; 
                  (2)  The rates associated with the service supplier's 911 service and other service supplier's recurring charges; 
                  (3)  The actual cost of salaries of employees hired by the county solely for the operation and maintenance of the emergency 911 system; 
                  (4)  Office supplies of the public safety answering points used directly in providing emergency 911 system services; and 
                  (5)  The cost of leasing or purchasing a building used as a public safety answering point.

                  Sec. 30-40. - Contracting with service supplier. 
                  The county may contract with a service supplier for any term negotiated by the service supplier and the county for an emergency 911 system and may make payments from the emergency telephone system fund to provide any payments required by the contract. 
                  (Ord. No. 67, § 9, 12-27-1990) 
                  Sec. 30-41. - Retention of records by service supplier. 
                  The service supplier shall maintain records of the amount of the 911 charge collected for a period of at least three years from the date of collection. The county may, at its expense, require an annual audit of the service supplier's books and records with respect to the collection and remittance of the 911 charge. 
                  (Ord. No. 67, § 10, 12-27-1990) 
                  Sec. 30-42. - Prepaid wireless 911 charge. 
                  The Forsyth County Board of Commissioners does hereby levy and impose a prepaid wireless 911 charge in the amount of $0.75 per retail transaction as authorized by O.C.G.A. § 46-5-134.2(b) and (j). Such charge shall be collected by sellers, as defined in O.C.G.A. § 46-5-134.2(a)(8), and remitted to the state revenue commissioner in conformance with O.C.G.A. § 46-5-134.2. Funds received by the county from charges imposed by this resolution shall be deposited in the emergency telephone system fund maintained by the county pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 46-5-134 and kept separate from general revenue of the county, all such funds to be used exclusively for the purposes authorized by O.C.G.A. § 46-5-134(e) and (f).

                  (16)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for control or treatment of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent streams beyond the levels specified in section 34-34(b)(2); 
                  (17)  Except as provided in subsections (18) and (19) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of state waters requiring buffers, as measured on a horizontal plane from the edge of the state water or top of state water bank, whichever results in a greater buffer, except: (1) where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, (2) where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, (3) where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented, (4) or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; (5) or along any ephemeral stream. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; 
                  (18)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured on a horizontal plane from the edge of the state water or top of state water bank, whichever results in a greater buffer along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, providing for notice to the division or local issuing authority of the location and extent of the piping and prescribed methodology for minimizing the impact of such piping and for measuring the volume of water discharged by the stream. Any such pipe must stop short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner must comply with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout steams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (19)  There is established a 25-foot buffer a long coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with O.C.G.A. tit. 12, ch. 5, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to Code Section 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to Code Section 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade stormwater detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "Minor Buffer Impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
                  (20)  Clearing and grading required for construction of streets, drainage, and utilities is not considered mass grading, therefore mass grading shall not be allowed in RES1 and RES2 zoning districts; however, mass grading may be allowed for commercial and institutional uses permitted in the RES1 and RES2 zoning districts. Mass grading may be allowed in the RES3 zoning district if the department of engineering determines that the topography and configuration of the property reasonably require mass grading. Mass grading is allowed in R-4 and R-6 zoning districts provided that all mass grading activities shall be kept to a practicable minimum. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in section 34-34(b) and (c) of this article. 
                  (e)  In addition to the stream buffer requirements in section 34-34(b) and (c) of this article, the Forsyth County Board of Commissioners has adopted a 50-foot undisturbed buffer with an additional 25-foot impervious surface setback as outlined in Sections 18.11.2 and 18.11.3 of the Uniform Development Code. 
                  (f)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 73-C, § IV, 6-3-2010; Ord. No. 73-D, § IV, 12-1-2016)

All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a), half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10), shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond or irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof, acceptable to the issuing authority prior to the issuance of the permit. The amount of the bond or irrevocable letter of credit, or combination thereof, shall be $3,000.00 per disturbed acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, except that in the event the director of engineering determines that special circumstances exist such as would warrant a need for additional protection, the director of engineering shall have the discretion to increase the bond amount up to a total of $5,000.00 per disturbed acre or fraction thereof. If the applicant does not comply with this article or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements: 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 34-34(b) and (c) of this article. Conformance with the minimum requirements may be attained through the use of design criteria in the current issue of the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, published by the state soil and water conservation commission as a guide; or through the use of alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections of any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plans shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in no event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary, and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation, and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 34-34(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per section 34-35(b)(6), are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority.

The notice shall provide five days in which to correct the issues of noncompliance. If the issues are not corrected within five days of the second notice, the local issuing authority may issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the issue presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state, the director or local issuing authority may issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a notice to comply. Fines and penalties associated with violations of this paragraph shall be in accord with the provisions of section 34-37(a) and (c). 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent failure to comply with the provisions of this article on the site in question, the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order. 
                  (3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action and mitigation have occurred, and all penalties have been paid. No certificate of occupancy or final plats will be issued until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  (4)  Notwithstanding the provisions of section 34-37(b)(1) above, when a failure to comply occurs in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, then an immediate stop work order may be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the project with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. Fines and penalties associated with violations of this paragraph shall be in accord with the provisions of section 34-37(a) and (c). 
                  (c)  Administrative penalties: Any issuance of a stop work order may be accompanied by administrative fines of up to $1,000.00 per day per violation until such time as all issues of noncompliance that constitute a violation are brought into compliance and a site inspection has been conducted by the department of engineering. Any administrative fine assessed under this paragraph may be appealed in accord with section 34-39(a). In lieu of a $1,000.00 per day administrative fine, a magistrate court citation may be issued with fines up to $2,500.00 per day as outlined in subsection (e) below. 
                  The following penalties shall apply to land-disturbing activities performed in violation of any provision of this article, any rules and regulations adopted pursuant hereto, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or any activities performed in violation of the state general permit. 
                  (1)  There shall be a minimum penalty of $250.00 per day for each violation involving land-disturbing activities involving the construction of a single-family dwelling. There shall be a minimum penalty of $1,000.00 per day for each violation involving land-disturbing activities involving the construction of any structure other than a single-family dwelling. 
                  (2)  There shall be a minimum penalty of $1,000.00 per day for each violation involving impacts to the applicable state waters buffer; and a buffer revegetation must be performed in accordance with the Forsyth County State Waters, River, and Tributary Riparian Buffer-Revegetation Checklist. 
                  (d)  Bond forfeiture: If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with any provision of this article, any rules and regulations adopted pursuant hereto, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or any activities performed in violation of the state general permit, then a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person in accordance with section 34-37(b)(1). The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the noncompliance issues. The stop work order shall provide the owner/operator ten days to achieve compliance with any violations associated with the stop work. If the owner/operator fails to comply with the violations in the time specified then the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (e)  Monetary penalties: Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the local issuing authority issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article under county ordinances approved under this article shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation. Once a person demonstrates that the land disturbance has been stabilized and a site inspection has been conducted by the department of engineering, the court may suspend subsequent monetary penalties. 
                  (f)  Notification of notices to comply and stop work orders: The local issuing authority shall provide official notification of the issuance of notices to comply and stop work orders by posting copies thereof on the property in compliance with the provisions of the state general permit.

                  Sec. 34-182. - Findings. 
                  (a)  Uncontrolled stormwater drainage/discharge may have a significant, adverse impact on the health, safety, and welfare of the county and the quality of life of its citizens. More specifically, surface water runoff can carry pollutants and nutrients into receiving waters. The potential impacts of these pollutant and nutrient loadings include: 
                  (1)  Sediment can alter natural systems, scouring vital habitat and smothering stream life; 
                  (2)  Increased bacteria can pose a significant health risk; 
                  (3)  Excessive nutrients can accelerate algae growth and eutrophication of receiving waters, affecting adversely flora and fauna; 
                  (4)  Pollutants and nutrients can negatively affect vital habitat for fish, birds, wildlife and native plant communities; 
                  (5)  Metals can be toxic to aquatic life; 
                  (6)  Oil and grease can reduce oxygen levels; and 
                  (7)  The temperature of receiving waters can increase, affecting animal and plant habitat adversely. 
                  (b)  Uncontrolled stormwater drainage can increase the incidence of flooding and the level of floods which occur, endangering roads, other public and private property and human life. 
                  (c)  Altered land surfaces can change the rate and volume of runoff. These changes may result in the following: 
                  (1)  Stream banks can erode and slump, resulting in widening of streams; 
                  (2)  Tree root systems can be undercut; 
                  (3)  Erosion rates can increase; and 
                  (4)  Streambeds can become more uniform and shallow, providing less varied aquatic habitats. 
                  (d)  Adverse water quality and quantity consequences described in subsections (a) through (c) of this section could result in substantial economic losses. Potential losses include, but are not limited to, increases in water treatment costs, as well as state and federal fines associated with water quality violations. 
                  (e)  Many future problems can be avoided through proper stormwater management. 
                  (f)  Every parcel of real property, both public and private, either uses or benefits from the maintenance of the county storm sewer system. 
                  (g)  Current and anticipated growth will contribute to and increase the need for improvement and maintenance of the storm sewer system.

                  (3)  Require that new development and redevelopments maintain the predevelopment hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution, and increases in stream temperature. 
                  (4)  Establish procedures that minimize damage from flooding caused by development, while recognizing that natural fluctuations in water levels are beneficial. 
                  (5)  Require construction of drainage systems that aesthetically and functionally approximate natural systems. 
                  (6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety. 
                  (7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management reports, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow-up.

A violation of this article, including any noncompliance for correction or alleviation of violations specified in the county engineer's first notice within the specified time for the alleviation in the notice, shall constitute a misdemeanor. In the absence of a time specified for the correction, all violations must be corrected or alleviated as specified in the first notice within 30 days from the date of such notice. Failure to comply shall also constitute a misdemeanor and Forsyth County may impose a penalty not to exceed $1,000.00 (depending on the severity of the violation) for each day the violation remains unremedied after receipt of the notice of violation. The maximum penalty and punishment for any single violation of this article may not exceed that provided for in O.C.G.A § 36-1-20(b) as that subsection now provides or as it may be hereafter amended. Each day the noncompliance or violation is not corrected constitutes a separate violation. 
                  (b)  For flagrant violations of this article, Forsyth County may issue a citation to the applicant or other responsible person, requiring such person to appear in Forsyth County Magistrate Court to answer charges for such violation. Upon conviction, such person shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 or imprisonment for 60 days or both. 
                  (c)  The county may institute appropriate action or proceedings at law or equity for the enforcement of this article or to correct violations of this article. Any court of competent jurisdiction may have the right to issue restraining orders, temporary or permanent injunctions, and other appropriate forms of remedy or relief. Each day of noncompliance is considered a separate offense. Nothing contained in this article shall prevent the county from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation, including application for injunctive relief. 
                  (d)  Upon notice from the issuing authority or its agent, work on any project that is being done contrary to the provisions of this article or in a dangerous or unsafe manner shall be immediately stopped. Such notice shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner of the property, his authorized agent or the person or persons in charge of the activity on the property and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed. Where an emergency exists, no written notice shall be required. 
                  (Ord. No. 75, Amendment A, 6-21-2004)

                  Sec. 34-221. - Findings. 
                  It is necessary to exercise the police powers delegated to the board of commissioners by 1979 Ga. Laws, page 4001, to designate a floodplain, to regulate construction therein; to provide for floodplain and watershed integrity, to provide for violations and punishment thereof, to enact provisions for those purposes, and for other purposes. 
                  (Ord. No. 7, 8-5-1980) 
                  Sec. 34-222. - Floodplain established. 
                  (a)  The regulated floodplain of Big Creek, South Forsyth County, is hereby established to extend from the intersection of Big Creek with McGinnis Ferry Road on the south, northward along both sides of Big Creek to the intersection of Big Creek with Shiloh Road on the north. The boundaries of the regulated floodplain on either side of Big Creek are hereby established with reference to distance above mean sea level. At the following specific locations, land lying at or below the indicated contour elevations shall be part of the regulated floodplain of Big Creek, South Forsyth County. Excluded therefrom is land lying within the right-of-way of Georgia Highway 400: 
                  (1)  Intersection of Big Creek with the north right-of-way of McGinnis Ferry Road, 998 feet above mean sea level; 
                  (2)  Intersection of Big Creek with the north right-of-way of McFarland Road, 1,007.5 feet above mean sea level; 
                  (3)  Intersection of Big Creek with the southeast right-of-way of Georgia Highway 400, 1,008 feet above mean sea level; 
                  (4)  Intersection of Big Creek with the northwest right-of-way of Georgia Highway 400, 1,009 feet above mean sea level; and 
                  (5)  Intersection of Big Creek with the south right-of-way of Shiloh Road, 1,011 feet above mean sea level. 
                  (b)  Between the established elevation points listed in subsection (a) of this section, the floodplain maximum elevations shall increase or decrease in the same proportion as the streambed elevation of Big Creek increases or decreases at a given time of measurement. Calculations shall be made according to the shortest straight line distance to Big Creek. For example, all points at or below 1,007.5 feet contour elevation perpendicular to the centerline of Big Creek at the point established in subsection (a)(2) of this section are within the regulated floodplain; likewise all points at or below 1,008 feet contour elevation perpendicular to the centerline of Big Creek at the point established in subsection (a)(3) of this section are within the regulated floodplain; therefore, the actual streambed elevation increase of Big Creek between those points shall determine the floodplain elevation at intermediate points; should the Big Creek streambed elevation at the point established in subsection (a)(2) of this section be four feet less than the point established in subsection (a)(3) of this section at the same time of measurement, then any point closest to where the streambed level of Big Creek is two feet above the point established in subsection (a)(2) of this section shall be within the regulated floodplain if such point is at or below 1,007.75 feet above mean sea level. The formula for determining whether a given point is within the regulated floodplain is given in Exhibit C in section 34-229.

                  ARTICLE III. - RAW WOOD WASTE PROCESSING/RECYCLING STORAGE AND OPERATIONS 

                  Sec. 38-71. - General. 
                  Scope. The storage and processing of wood chips, hogged material, fines, compost, mulch and raw products in association with yard waste and recycling facilities located within Forsyth County shall be in accordance with the Forsyth County Ordinance and the International Fire Code. 
                  Purpose. This standard shall provide guidelines for raw wood waste processors and recyclers and their operations. Wood chipping, hogging, composting and mulching operations and storage create a significant fire hazard and are rated as a very high hazard based on the "Heat of Output" Btu per pound of product. 
                  While generally more difficult to ignite than usual class A combustibles such as paper and cardboard, after being ignited the spread of fire and smoke can be rapid and deepseated. The larger the storage of raw wood products, the greater the fire hazard and the more difficult a fire is to control. Wood waste processors and recyclers and their operations shall comply with this standard. 
                  Responsibility. All individuals and companies who engage or intend to engage in the storage, processing or handling of compost, mulch and organic materials shall comply with the requirement of the Forsyth County Fire Department and this standard. 
                  Permit required. A permit shall be obtained from the fire department prior to engaging in the storing or processing of wood chips, hogged material, fines, compost and raw product in association with yard waste and similar material recycling facilities. The permit shall be renewed on an annual basis, or shall be limited to such period of time as designated by the Fire Code official. Permits shall not be transferable and any change in use, location, occupancy, operation, or ownership shall require a new permit.

Internal pile temperatures must be taken at two-thirds the pile height, 12 to 24 inches from the surface with a probe-type thermometer. Readings shall be made at not greater than 50-foot intervals along the length of the pile. 
                  Once windrows exceed 158 degrees F, the operator must institute reasonable measures to prevent internal temperatures from continuing to rise. 
                  Once windrows exceed 170 degrees F, the windrows must be reduced in size, be rotated, and be monitored daily until temperatures drop below 158 degrees F. All green waste stockpiles shall be re-mixed as necessary to alleviate any fire due to spontaneous combustion or temperatures above 170 degrees F°. 
                  Windrows shall be visually inspected on a weekly basis. Once fires have been detected in any windrows at a site, this visual inspection shall be a minimum daily requirement. Daily inspections shall continue until the threat of fire no longer exists, and the Fire Code official approves suspension. 
                  All temperature and pile-handling records shall be kept on file at the site and be made available for inspection by fire department personnel. Data shall include date, time, temperature, specific location, and person conducting measurement.

                  Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a building, taking place during the life of a building, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the building. The market value of the building should be (i) the appraised value of the building prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (ii) in the case of damage, the value of the building prior to the damage occurring. The term "substantial improvement" includes structures that have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the code enforcement official and which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.

                  Cross reference— Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
                  Sec. 46-33. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
                  (c)  Flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas.

                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
                  (2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
                  (4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
                  (5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions; 
                  4.  Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and 
                  5.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (2)  For individual residential structures that are not part of a larger development, the first floor shall be at least three feet above the base flood elevation only if the water surface elevation of the future conditions floodplain is not known for the location. If the base flood elevation for an individual residence cannot be determined from the effective FEMA maps, the best estimate shall be made by comparing the extent of the floodplain in the FIRM with the best available topographic mapping. This estimation shall be conducted and certified by a land surveyor or engineer registered in the State of Georgia and approved by the department of engineering. 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. 
                  a.  New manufactured homes shall not be allowed to be placed within the limits of the future conditions floodplain unless all requirements of general standards (see above section 46-81). 
                  b.  All manufactured homes placed, or substantially improved, in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than three feet above the level of the base flood elevation or one foot above the future conditions flood elevation whichever is higher; 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength of no less than 36 inches in height above grade; and 
                  3.  The manufactured home must be securely anchored to the adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
                  c.  In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, any manufactured home placed or substantially improved must meet the standards of subsection (4)a. this section.

                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, and be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or 
                  2.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for manufactured homes, including anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (4)a. of this section. 
                  3.  A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached structures. 
                  (4)  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 46-37, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and has erosion potential, no encroachments shall be allowed in the floodway including placement of manufactured homes, construction or substantial improvement of structures, grading, filling, cutting or displacement of earth. 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in subsection b. below. 
                  b.  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and, 
                  c.  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by Forsyth County until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) and no-rise certification is issued by FEMA. 
                  (5)  Future conditions floodplain. No development shall be allowed within the future conditions floodplain that could result in any of the following: 
                  a.  Raising the base flood elevation or future conditions flood elevation equal to or more than 0.01 foot;

                  d.  Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation. 
                  (6)  Any development within the future conditions floodplain allowed under subsection (1) above shall also meet the following conditions: 
                  a.  Compensation for storage capacity shall occur between the average ground water table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and between the average ground water table elevation and the future condition flood elevation for the future conditions flood, and lie either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed and shall be within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain storage. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the top of the natural (pre-development) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel; 
                  b.  Cut areas shall be stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than 2.0 percent; 
                  c.  Effective transitions shall be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased; 
                  d.  Verification of no-rise conditions (0.01 foot or less), flood storage volumes, and flow characteristics shall be provided via a step-backwater analysis meeting the requirements of section 46-83; 
                  e.  Public utilities and facilities, such as water, sanitary sewer, gas, and electrical systems, shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration or contamination from flood waters; and 
                  f.  Any significant physical changes to the base flood floodplain shall be submitted as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. The CLOMR submittal shall be subject to approval by Forsyth County using the community consent forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for final approval. The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Within six months of the completion of construction, the applicant shall submit as-built surveys for a final letter of map revision (LOMR).

                  Warehouse means an establishment primarily engaged in the display, storage and sale of goods to other firms for resale, or activities involving significant movement and storage of products or equipment, or leasing of dead storage space. Typical uses include wholesale distributors, storage warehouses, moving and storage firms, trucking and shipping operations, mail processing centers, mini-warehouse, and self-storage facilities.

                  (2)  When requested, the impact fee administrator shall interpret the impact fee schedules as they may apply to a particular development using the procedures described in the appropriate impact fee ordinance and in this chapter. 
                  (3)  When requested, the impact fee administrator shall certify the impact fees applicable to a particular development using the procedures described in the appropriate impact fee ordinance and in this chapter. 
                  (4)  With respect to an individual fee determination, the impact fee administrator shall:

                  ARTICLE II. - IMPOSITION OF FEES 

                  Sec. 47-11. - Imposition of impact fees. 
                  (a)  Feepayer. Any person who, after the effective date of the appropriate impact fee ordinance, seeks to develop land by applying to the county for any of the following permits shall be required to pay an impact fee in the manner and amount set forth in the relevant ordinance and in this chapter: 
                  (1)  The issuance or extension of a building permit, or 
                  (2)  The issuance or extension of a permit that would allow the construction or installation of a structure, including a mobile home, or 
                  (3)  The issuance or extension of a permit that would allow the installation or placement of a recreational vehicle. 
                  Persons who filed a fully completed application for a permit prior to 5:00 p.m., the business day prior to the date on which the collection of road impact fees commences, which was subsequently approved within 30 days of submission, shall not be subject to the road impact fees for that permit. 
                  (b)  Payment due. 
                  (1)  General. Impact fees shall be paid prior to the issuance of a permit for any activity requiring payment of an impact fee. All payment shall be made in the following manner: 
                  a.  Payment by approved credit card, personal or business check, cashier's check, or money order payable to the county; 
                  b.  All payments are to be made at offices of the Forsyth County, Department of Planning and Community Development. 
                  (2)  Invalid payment. In the event the payment of impact fees subsequently proves to be invalid due to insufficient funds, improper execution, or for any other reason, then the following actions shall be taken: 
                  a.  The impact fee administrator shall, within 30 days of detection of such a deficiency, notify the feepayer, the contractor, and the property owner by certified mail to the last known address: 
                  1.  An impact fee amount is due by valid payment immediately upon receipt of said notice; 
                  2.  Permits, inspections or certificates will not be issued until the amount is paid and, if not paid within 30 days, the impact fee administrator shall have authority to instruct the Forsyth County Building Department to stop all construction on the site of said building or construction until the payment is received. 
                  b.  No further building permits, construction permits, inspections or certificate of use and occupancy (C.O.) shall be issued by the county until the required impact fee is paid. 
                  c.  The amount due shall be the amount of the impact fees plus the amount charged by the bank for the dishonored payment plus a service charge as established by the county 
                  (3)  Credit in lieu of payment. In the event the feepayer has received approval from the impact fee administrator for credits for construction or dedication of land pursuant to section 47-24 and the credits are provided before completion of the improvements, the feepayer must comply with all requirements as a condition of receiving such credits. Otherwise, full payment of the impact fee due will be required. 
                  (c)  Determination of fee. 
                  (1)  General. The amount of the impact fee shall be determined by the impact fee administrator, who shall receive assistance from other departments when necessary and appropriate. The impact fee administrator shall determine the amount of the fees due, whether the method of determination is based on the fee schedule contained in the appropriate impact fee ordinance or by independent fee determination study. The calculation of exemptions, refunds, and credits, and the determination of the net impact fees due shall also be the responsibility of the impact fee administrator with the assistance of appropriate county departments. 
                  (2)  Credits. In lieu of monetary payment, up to 100 percent of impact fees due may be paid by the use of credits, as provided in section 47-24. However, road credits may be used only for the payment of road impact fees, park credits may be used only for the payment of park impact fees, library credits may be used only for the payment of library impact fees and public safety credits may only be used for the payment of public safety impact fees. 
                  (d)  Expiration of building permits. 
                  (1)  If a permit expires, is revoked, or is voluntarily surrendered and is, therefore, voided and no construction or improvement of land has commenced, then the feepayer shall be entitled to a refund, without interest, of 95 percent of the impact fees which were paid as a condition for its issuance. The county shall retain five percent of the fees to offset the costs of collection and refund. The feepayer must submit an application for such a refund to the impact fee administrator within 30 days of the expiration of the permit. In the case of an expired permit which was obtained in whole or in part by the use of credits, only that portion not paid by credits may be refunded, and it is from this part that the five percent administrative fee shall be deducted. 
                  (2)  If a refund has been received by the feepayer, the feepayer must pay the appropriate impact fee if he/she reapplies for a permit. Conversely, if a permit expires and no refund has been issued, a feepayer will not have to pay the fee again if he/she reapplies for the permit on the same lot, parcel or tract unless the use or size of the structure has changed and then the amount due would be the change in the amount of the fee based upon the new structure as contrasted with the original. 
                  (3)  A credit for previous payment of an impact fee must be requested by the feepayer. Any exemption or credit not so requested at the time of reapplication shall be deemed waived by the feepayer. 
                  (4)  A refund of the impact fee shall not be granted if the permit expires and construction has commenced. In this case, the feepayer will not have to pay an impact fee if he/she reapplies for a permit for the same type and size of structure. In case of reapplication, the provisions of section 47-12(g) for change of use shall apply. 
                  (5)  The feepayer shall be responsible for requesting any credits or refunds pursuant to the terms of this chapter. The county will not be responsible for notifying the developer of a right to a refund or credit due to an expired permit. Upon receipt of such request, refunds and credits will be determined in accordance with section 47-23 and section 47-24. 
                  (Ord. No. 125, 4-7-2016) 
                  Sec. 47-12. - Determination of fees based on fee schedules. 
                  (a)  Payment from schedule. At the option of the feepayer, the amount of the fees can be determined from the schedule of fees listed below, utilizing section 47-32, Impact Fee Calculation Form. Impact fees for nonresidential development shall be converted to a fee per square foot by dividing the fee per 1,000 square feet by 1,000. Any impact fee for a development application shall be rounded to the nearest dollar. 
                  (1)  Fee schedule applicable on effective date. The following fee schedule shall apply to new development for which a building permit is issued on or after the effective date of this section. 

                   
                  (b)  Automatic adjustment. The impact fee schedule shown in subsection (a) above shall be adjusted by the impact fee administrator in April of each calendar year. Unless otherwise directed by the county board of commissioners, any adjustments to the impact fee made pursuant to this section shall be effective the first Monday in October of each calendar year. 
                  (1)  The base for computing any adjustment is the January Consumer Price Index - All Urban Consumers for the United States, published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
                  (2)  If the index is changed so that the base year is different, the index shall be converted in accordance with the conversion factor published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. If the index is discontinued or revised, such other government index or computation with which it is replaced shall be used in order to obtain substantially the same result as would be obtained if the index had not been discontinued or revised. 
                  (3)  The current inflation-adjusted fee schedule shall be available at the building permit counter and shall be posted on the County's web site in the County's current schedule of development fees and/or separately. 
                  (c)  Determination of land use type. If the type of development activity is not specified in the fee schedules, and is not already on a list of miscellaneous land use types maintained by the impact fee administrator, the impact fee administrator shall apply the fee of the most nearly equivalent type of land use on the fee schedules. The impact fee administrator shall be guided in the selection of a comparable land use type by the definitions in section 47-4, the list of land uses in section 47-31, the Forsyth County Comprehensive Plan and the land development regulations of the county. In the event that the classification of a particular use of land into the classification established by the ordinance is unclear, the North American Industry Classification System, United States, latest edition, shall be used as the final authority. The impact fee administrator shall maintain a list of the fees determined administratively for miscellaneous land use types. 
                  (d)  Interpretation of fee schedules. Individuals may request an interpretation of the impact fee schedules as they may apply to their developments. If the individual requests, the impact fee administrator shall certify the impact fees due for that development and said certification shall establish the applicable impact fees for such development for a period of 180 days from the date thereof. If the feepayer disagrees with the interpretation of the impact fee schedules, the feepayer may prepare an individual fee determination study in accordance with this chapter and the relevant impact fee ordinance. 
                  (e)  Mixed use development. If a development includes both residential and nonresidential uses, the impact fees are to be assessed for each use based on the fee schedule and the results added together. 
                  (f)  Mixed use structures. If a structure includes both residential and nonresidential uses, the impact fees are to be assessed for each use individually based on the relevant fee schedule and the results added together. 
                  (g)  Shell permit. Builders may apply for a building permit to construct the "shell" of a building. Tenant finish permits are issued later to finish construction of the interior of the structure. The impact fee shall be paid prior to the issuance of the building permit for construction of the shell. The amount of the fee shall be based on the intended land use as described by the builder. If a builder applies for a "shell" permit and the intended land use is not known, the impact fees shall be assessed based on that land use which generates the greatest impact and is allowed under the existing zoning for the lot or parcel. If it is found during review of the application for a tenant finish permit that the actual land use differs from the intended land use as described by the builder, a determination shall be made as to whether or not an additional impact fee is due based on the procedures for change of use. If so, the additional impact fee shall be paid prior to the issuance of a new building permit for the completion of the shell. If it is determined that there has been an over-payment of impact fees, a refund would become available pursuant to section 47-23(e) of this chapter. If a shell permit was issued prior to the effective date of the appropriate impact fee ordinance and left unfinished, no impact fee shall be assessed for tenant finish permits. Subsequent change of use, redevelopment, or modification of the structure may be subject to an impact fee based on the procedures for change of use. 
                  (h)  Change of use. In the case of a change of use, redevelopment, or modification of an existing use which requires the issuance of a building permit, the impact fee shall be based upon the net increase in the impact fees for the new use as compared to the previous use. The amount of the impact fees that is due as a result of the change in land use shall be determined at the time the feepayer applies for a building permit. The impact fees shall be paid prior to the issuance of a building permit for construction or remodeling. Previous land use shall be the lawful land use physically existing on the effective date of the ordinance or the current lawful land use. The feepayer shall furnish all documentation required by the impact fee administrator to determine the previous use. Should the change of use, redevelopment, or modification result in a net decrease in the impact, no refunds or credits for impact fees previously paid shall be made. If the change of land use does not require the issuance of a building permit, there shall be no requirement to pay an impact fee. 
                  (i)  Accessory or auxiliary uses. Generally, no fee shall be assessed for accessory or auxiliary land uses for residential developments, such as a clubhouse or tennis court in an apartment complex, unless it can be established by the impact fee administrator that the land use serves as an individual attraction. However, structures that meet the definition of a "dwelling" in the Forsyth County Building Code are not exempted as accessory or auxiliary uses. 
                  (j)  Mobile homes. When a person applies for a permit that would authorize the installation of a mobile home, the feepayer may request a determination by the impact fee administrator as to whether or not a mobile home (or other dwelling unit) was legally in place on that lot, parcel, or space prior to the effective date of the ordinance. If so, no impact fee shall be assessed for installation of the mobile home. An exemption will be granted if it can be documented that an impact fee has been paid previously for a mobile home on that same lot, parcel, or space. Documentation to be used by the impact fee administrator may include utility bills for the period of time in question or tax records. 
                  (k)  House moves and mobile home moves. Impact fees shall be assessed for structures or mobile homes moved from one location to another unless the structure or unit being moved is a replacement of an equivalent use at the new location. If the structure or mobile home so moved is replaced by an equivalent use at the old location, no impact fee shall be due for the replacement use. In every case, the burden of proving past payment of impact fees, exemption, or equivalency of use rests with the feepayer. 
                  (l)  Recreational vehicles (RV's). Reference to "recreational vehicles" refers to the recreational vehicle site which has been permitted by an applicable development approval. The development of an RV site, not the issuance of a permit, is the relevant regulatory issue for this chapter and the administration of the impact fee. Recreational vehicle development approval should contain a condition of approval providing for payment of the impact fee. The impact fee shall be paid according to this condition of approval and the following provisions: 
                  (1)  No impact fees shall be assessed for "move in" of a recreational vehicle in an RV park developed prior to the effective date of the ordinance or that has paid an impact fee. 
                  (2)  RV's located outside of RV parks shall be treated as mobile homes. RV owners who apply for a permit, et cetera, shall pay the impact fees at the same rate as a mobile home and are entitled to the same exemptions as mobile home owners. 
                  (m)  Model homes. Model homes on residentially zoned land shall be charged residential impact fees. Model homes on land zoned for nonresidential use shall be charged nonresidential impact fees. 
                  (Ord. No. 125, 4-7-2016; Ord. No. 47, 2-2-2017; Ord. No. 47, § 2(Exh. A), 2-2-2017) 
                  Sec. 47-13. - Exemptions and waivers. 
                  (a)  Must be claimed by feepayer. An exemption must be claimed by the feepayer at the time of application for a building permit. Any exemption not so claimed shall be deemed waived by the feepayer. 
                  (b)  Total exemptions. 
                  (1)  Exemption list. The following shall be exempted from payment of all impact fees: 
                  a.  Alteration of an existing building or use of land where the existing use of the property is not changed and there is no additional heated area in residential structures or enclosed or open area in residential structures. 
                  b.  The construction of residential accessory or auxiliary buildings or structures which will not be occupied by residents will be exempt from the requirement to pay park and recreation or library impact fees. 
                  c.  The replacement of a lawfully permitted building, mobile home, recreational vehicle, trailer or structure with a new unit, building or structure of the same type, use and size. If the existing unit, building, or structure is torn down, destroyed by fire or other natural disaster, or otherwise eliminated or moved off the site, or if the original structure is converted to a utility building, garage, or other nonresidential or noncommercial use, the replacement structure will be exempt from the payment of impact fees. The permit applicant shall document such replacement. 
                  d.  An amendment to a development approval provided that the amended development approval does not increase the impact of the development. 
                  e.  A permit which does not result in any additional residents, visitors, building occupants, customers or employees within the county. 
                  (2)  Applicant's duty. In applying for the above-mentioned exemptions, it shall be the applicant's responsibility to furnish, as required by the impact fee administrator, all materials and information necessary to validate the exemption including, but not limited to, the following: 
                  a.  Current opinion of title or title insurance; 
                  b.  Old and new construction plans; 
                  c.  Official certificate of occupancy and use records; 
                  d.  Statements from owner stating past and proposed land use; 
                  e.  Utility bills or receipts; and 
                  f.  Tax records. 
                  (c)  Exemption based on error or misrepresentation. Exemptions from payment of an impact fee based on error or misrepresentation shall be subject to the provisions for invalid payments found in section 47-11(b)(2). 
                  (d)  Exemptions for vested permit applications. Applicants for vested permits must meet the following requirements in order to obtain and maintain an exemption from the payment of some or all impact fees: 
                  (1)  Complete application for permit allowing construction of a building, mobile home installation or recreational vehicle installation. The applicant must submit to the impact fee administrator a completed application form with all necessary attachments, forms, and plans to meet the following requirements: 
                  a.  Applications for residential building permits must meet all of the requirements of the items listed on the "Impact Fee Calculation Form," section 47-32. 
                  b.  Applications for permits for mobile home installation must meet all of the requirements of the items identified on the "Impact Fee Calculation Form," section 47-32. 
                  c.  Applications for permit for recreational vehicle installation must meet all of the requirements of the items identified on the "Impact Fee Calculation Form," section 47-32. 
                  d.  Applications for nonresidential building permits must meet all of the items identified on the "Impact Fee Calculation Form," section 47-32. 
                  e.  The application form must have been reviewed and assigned an application number by the department of planning and community development. In addition, the date and time stamped by the department of planning and community development on the application form must be prior to the effective date of the ordinance or ordinance amendment. 
                  (2)  The applicant must pick-up the permit within 30 days of the date stamped on the application by the impact fee administrator. 
                  (3)  Health department permit review. If the applicant has experienced delays in health department permit review, then a receipt from the county health department documenting that the applicant has submitted to the health department both of the following applications on or prior to the effective date of the ordinance must be provided: 
                  a.  Percolation test (soil suitability test); and 
                  b.  Septic tank permit (application for on-site sewage disposal system permit). 
                  (4)  Zoning issues. In order for the applicant to pick-up a permit within the required 30 days, it will be necessary for the impact fee administrator to sign off on the application. If the impact fee administrator determines that a variance may be necessary and applying for one could cause the applicant to lose an impact fee exemption, the impact fee administrator may adjust the relevant time period for a time reasonably sufficient for the applicant to pursue a variance procedure. 
                  (5)  Appeals. Applicants whose requests for exemptions from impact fees are rejected may appeal the decision pursuant to section 47-24. 
                  (e)  Waivers. The collection of impact fees may be waived for particular development projects that create extraordinary economic development or provide affordable housing, provided the following conditions are met. 
                  (1)  Affordable housing waivers. Applications for affordable housing waivers must comply with the following. 
                  a.  Any person seeking an affordable housing exemption shall file with the county manager an application for exemption prior to the impact fee payment date for the proposed residential construction. The application for exemption shall contain the following: 
                  i.  The name and address of the owner; 
                  ii.  The legal description of the residential construction; 
                  iii.  The proposed selling price or the proposed rental price, as applicable; and 
                  iv.  Evidence that the residential construction shall be occupied by low income persons or very-low-income persons. 
                  b.  For residential construction to receive an affordable housing waiver, it must meet all the restrictions of affordable housing as provided herein, and these restrictions must continue for a period of at least ten (10) years from the date of issuance of the building permit. 
                  c.  If the residential construction meets the requirements for an affordable housing waiver, and sufficient non-impact-fee funds have been appropriated by the board of commissioners for this purpose and are available to pay the impact fees for the construction, the impact fee administrator shall transfer the funds into the appropriate impact fee accounts and issue the waiver. The waiver shall be presented in lieu of payment of the impact fees. 
                  d.  In the event the residential dwelling unit fails to meet the restrictions of affordable housing as provided herein at any time within the ten-year period following the issuance of the building permit such that the property no longer qualifies as affordable housing, the impact fees in effect at the time of the change in circumstances shall be immediately due. 
                  (2)  Economic development waivers. The board of commissioners may waive impact fees for particular development projects that create extraordinary economic development and employment growth, pursuant to the following provisions. 
                  a.  The board of commissioners shall make a finding that the proposed development would create extraordinary economic development and employment growth. 
                  b.  The board of commissioners shall appropriate sufficient non-impact fee revenue to pay for the waiver. 
                  c.  Once the above conditions are satisfied, the impact fee administrator shall transfer the funds into the appropriate impact fee accounts and issue the waiver. The waiver shall be presented in lieu of payment of the impact fees. 
                  (Ord. No. 125, 4-7-2016) 
                  Sec. 47-14. - Individual fee determination. 
                  (a)  Option of the feepayer. If a feepayer shall opt not to have impact fees determined according to the fee schedule in section 47-12(a), then the feepayer shall prepare and submit an individual fee determination in accordance with this section and the appropriate impact fee ordinance. The utilization of this option by the feepayer shall not exempt him/her from paying the impact fee prior to the issuance of a permit. 
                  (b)  Notice of intent by feepayer. The feepayer shall inform the impact fee administrator of his/her intent to utilize an individual fee determination. The impact fee administrator shall then schedule a pre-application meeting with the applicant. 
                  (c)  Pre-application meeting. Before beginning the individual fee determination study, the feepayer or his/her representative shall be given the opportunity to attend a pre-application meeting with the impact fee administrator. The purpose of the pre-application meeting is to discuss the procedures of the individual fee determination study, the methodology to be employed, and the standards to be met. Results, conclusions, and agreements reached at the pre-application meeting regarding methodology, required forms or documentation, or procedures, which may not constitute a waiver of ordinance provisions, shall be placed in writing by the impact fee administrator within 15 days. A copy of this memorandum shall be sent to the applicant. The agreements set out in the letter will expire in 30 days unless the applicant acknowledges receipt and acceptance of the agreements in writing, to the impact fee administrator, within those 30 days. The applicant may waive the pre-application meeting. Any applicant who waives this pre-application meeting has waived his/her right to administratively raise methodological or procedural issues at a subsequent time. 
                  (d)  Guidelines. 
                  (1)  The purpose of the individual determination study is to measure the impact of the development in question on the arterial road system, the park and recreation system, the library system, or the public safety system of the county. 
                  (2)  An individual determination study must address the expected impact of the development over the projected life of the structures within the development. Any claim that the use or occupancy of the structures within the development will be different from normal use or occupancy must be supported by deed restrictions, restrictive covenants or other appropriate documentation that will support the claim. 
                  (3)  The individual fee determination study shall follow the methodologies and formats which are agreed upon during the pre-application meeting and be in accord with the methodology used in the supporting impact fee study. The methodology in the impact fee study multiplies the number of service units generated by the land use by the net cost per service unit. The individual fee determination study may only address the expected number of service units to be generated by the development, and shall use the net cost per service unit contained in the appropriate impact fee study. The service units are daily vehicle-miles of travel for the road impact fees, household residents for the park and library impact fees, and functional population for the public safety impact fees. In the event that the impact fees are adopted at a percentage less than 100 percent of the maximum fees calculated in the impact fee study, the individual fee determination study shall apply the same percentage at which the current fees are adopted. 
                  a.  A minimum of three sites for the land use in question should be selected. The selected sites should be single use sites and should, whenever possible, be located in the county. 
                  b.  The site inventory and sites proposed for the survey shall be reviewed by the impact fee administrator. The impact fee administrator must approve the sites to be surveyed prior to initiation of any survey. 
                  (4)  The individual fee determination study shall be prepared and presented by professionals qualified in their respective fields. The methodology shall be consistent with best professional practice and support the central claim of the study. The study shall provide all necessary supporting documentation and information. Failure to adhere to best professional standards is a basis for rejection of the study. The applicant's submission must certify that the study complies with best professional practices and this attestation shall be sealed where and when applicable. 
                  (5)  The applicant shall submit the study to the impact fee administrator. This submission shall begin the 30-day clock referred to below. 
                  (6)  The applicant shall provide the impact fee administrator with the name, address and telephone number of the property owner, the contractor and the applicant. 
                  (e)  Recoupment of cost. 
                  (1)  The impact fee administrator may require applicants pursuing an individual fee determination to reimburse the county for reasonable non-staff personnel and associated expenses it incurs in order to adequately review and evaluate independent fee determinations. 
                  (2)  The impact fee administrator shall notify applicants in writing if the county intends to obtain and seek recoupment for non-staff personnel and associated expenses that it deems necessary to properly evaluate the application. 
                  (3)  Subsequent to notification, the impact fee administrator shall provide good faith estimates of the costs to be borne by the applicant. 
                  (f)  Sufficiency determination. 
                  (1)  The impact fee administrator will review the individual fee determination study for sufficiency, methodology, technical accuracy and findings. The impact fee administrator shall have 30 days to review the study and to inform the applicant, in writing, of any deficiencies or defects in the study, or to find the study complete and competent. The notice of sufficiency or lack thereof shall be mailed to the applicant. In the event that this notice is not given within 30 days, the study shall be considered complete and competent. 
                  (2)  Upon receipt of notice of deficiencies or defects in the study, the applicant may modify or supplement the study and resubmit a modified study. The applicant shall have 30 days to respond to said notice and/or resubmit a modified study to remedy defects or deficiencies identified in the notice. The impact fee administrator will consider the individual fee determination study to be inactive if the impact fee administrator does not receive a response from the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the above notice. 
                  (3)  Upon receipt of a response or resubmittal of the study, the impact fee administrator shall have 30 days to review the resubmittal or response and notify the applicant of any further defects or deficiencies in the resubmittal. If the impact fee administrator finds deficiencies or defects in a resubmitted study, notice of such deficiencies or defects shall be provided as in subsection (1) above and subsequent responses from applicants shall be resubmitted as provided in subsection (2) above. 
                  (g)  Determination of fee. 
                  (1)  The determination of the amount of the applicable impact fee shall be made by the impact fee administrator based on his/her review of a competent and sufficient independent determination study. 
                  (2)  If an applicant requests, the impact fee administrator shall certify, as provided in the Georgia Development Impact Fee Act, O.C.G.A. § 36-71-2(h), the impact fees due for a development and said certification shall establish the applicable impact fees for such development for a period of 180 days from the date thereof. 
                  (h)  Effective date. The effective date for impact fees assessed by an individual fee determined shall be the date at which the individual fee determination study is found to be sufficient, or 30 days after submission if there is no finding with respect to sufficiency. 
                  (i)  Notification of feepayer and appeal. Within 30 days of the determination that the study is deemed competent and complete, the impact fee administrator shall notify the feepayer in writing of the acceptance, conditional acceptance, or rejection of the request. If the feepayer disagrees with the findings of the impact fee administrator, the feepayer may appeal the decision pursuant to section 47-25. 
                  (j)  Application for permit. It shall be the responsibility of the feepayer, at the time of application for a building permit, to present the approved individually determined fee as approved by the impact fee administrator.

                  Sec. 47-22. - Use of impact fee funds. 
                  (a)  Impact fees collected shall be used solely for the purpose system improvements for the type of public facility for which the fees were collected, and shall not be used for maintenance or operations. 
                  (b)  Funds shall be used exclusively for acquisitions, expansions, or capital improvements within the service area from which the funds were collected. In the event that the City of Cumming does not enter into an interlocal agreement to collect the county's impact fees from new development within its jurisdiction, impact fees shall not be used to fund improvements located within the city limits, unless a determination is made that the location of the improvement within the city limits is necessary to most efficiently serve new development in the unincorporated area. 
                  (c)  In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are issued for advanced provision of capital facilities for which impact fees may be expended, impact fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that the facilities provided are of the type described in subsections (a) and (b) above. 
                  (d)  In the event a developer enters into an agreement with the county to construct, fund or contribute system improvements so that the amount of the credit created by such construction, funding or contribution is in excess of the impact fee otherwise due, the developer shall be reimbursed for such excess construction funding or contribution from development impact fees paid by other developments located in the service area which is benefited by such improvements if so provided in the agreement. 
                  (e)  At least once each fiscal period the impact fee administrator shall present to the board of commissioners a report describing the amount of impact fees collected, encumbered and used, and a proposed capital improvement program, which assigns funds, including any accrued interest, from the several impact fee trust funds to specific improvement projects and related expenses. Monies, including any accrued interest, not assigned in any fiscal period shall be retained in the same impact fee trust funds until the next fiscal period except as provided by the refund provisions of section 47-23. 
                  (f)  Impact fee funds may be used to provide refunds. 
                  (g)  Funds in the impact fee trust accounts shall be considered expended on a first in, first out basis. 
                  (h)  Fire and library fees collected under previous ordinances that required that funds collected in the north service area be spent in the north service area, and that funds collected in the south service area be spent in the south service area, shall be expended according to the requirements of those ordinances. 
                  (i)  Emergency communications (E-911) impact fees collected under the previous public safety impact fee ordinance shall continue to be kept in a separate account and spent according to the provisions of that ordinance.

                  Sec. 47-23. - Refunds. 
                  (a)  Expiration, revocation, or surrender of permit. In the event that a building permit or other development approval for which an impact fee was paid expires, is revoked or is surrendered without the commencement of construction, a feepayer or his/her successors in interest shall be entitled to a refund, without interest, equal to 95 percent of the impact fee paid. Five percent of the fee shall be retained by the county to offset the administrative costs of collection and refund. In the case of an expired permit or development approval which was obtained in whole or in part by the use of credits, only the portion not obtained by credit may be refunded. 
                  (b)  Denial of service. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-71-9, in the event that road, park, library or public safety service or access to facilities under the jurisdiction of the County is denied after a road, park, library or public safety impact fee has been paid, the feepayer or his/her successors in interest shall be entitled to a refund of the applicable impact fee. 
                  (1)  Before issuance of the refund can be authorized, the feepayer or his/her successors in interest shall submit a written request for refund to the impact fee administrator. This request must be submitted within 180 days of the date of the denial of service or access. 
                  (2)  In applying for the refund, it shall be the applicant's responsibility to furnish, as required by the impact fee administrator, all materials and information necessary to validate proof of payment by the feepayer or his/her predecessor in interest, the date and amount paid, and the permit issued as a result of that payment. The impact fee administrator shall verify whether the impact fee is refundable and, if so, process the applicant's request. 
                  (3)  The refunded impact fee shall be returned to the applicant with a pro rata share of interest actually earned on the amount to be refunded.

                  (1)  When funds have not been expended or encumbered within the appropriate period, the impact fee administrator shall provide written notice of an entitlement to a refund to the feepayer who paid the development impact fee at the last known address or to a successor in interest who has given notice of name and address to Forsyth County, Department of Planning and Community Development, of a transfer or assignment of the right or entitlement to a refund and who has provided a mailing address. Such notice shall also be published within 30 days after the expiration of the six-year period after the date that the development impact fees were collected and shall contain the heading "Notice of Entitlement to Development Impact Fee Refund." 
                  (2)  Before issuance of the refund can be authorized pursuant to this section, the feepayer or his/her successor in interest shall submit a written request for refund to the impact fee administrator.

The impact fee administrator shall verify whether the impact fee is refundable and if so, process the applicant's request. 
                  (4)  Any impact fee to be refunded under this section shall be made to the feepayer with a pro rata share of interest actually earned on the unused or excess balance within 60 days of after it is determined that sufficient proof of claim for a refund has been made.

                  (d)  Termination. In the event that the imposition of an impact fee is terminated in a portion or in the whole of the county, the trust account balance(s) for that area shall be considered refundable upon application of the feepayer or his/her successor in interest. No refunds of fees will be provided for in the event the fees collected have been expended or encumbered or if a feepayer or his/her successor in interest does not request such a refund. 
                  (1)  Within 30 days following the effective date of this termination, the impact fee administrator shall provide written notice of an entitlement to a refund to the feepayer who paid the development impact fee at the address shown on the application for a permit or to a successor in interest who has given notice to Forsyth County, Department of Planning and Community Development, of a transfer or assignment of the right or entitlement to a refund and who has provided a mailing address. Such notice shall contain the heading "Notice of Entitlement to Development Impact Fee Refund." 
                  (2)  Before issuance of the refund can be authorized pursuant to this section, the feepayer or his/her successor in interest shall submit a written request for refund to the impact fee administrator.

All rights to a refund shall be deemed waived if requests are not timely received. 
                  (3)  In applying for the refund, it shall be the applicant's responsibility to furnish, as required by the impact fee administrator, all materials and information necessary to validate proof of payment by the feepayer or his/her predecessor in interest, the date and amount paid, and the permit issued as a result of that payment. The impact fee administrator shall verify whether the impact fee is refundable and if so, process the applicant's request. 
                  (4)  Fees available for refund shall be prorated over those eligible applicants submitting proper application for refund. In no case shall the applicant receive a refund greater than the amount originally paid plus a pro rata share of interest actually earned on the impacts fees to be refunded. Any trust fund balance not so refunded shall be transferred to the General Fund of Forsyth County. 
                  Holders of impact fee credits shall be considered feepayers for purposes of refunds under this termination procedure. 
                  (e)  Overpayment. A refund, without interest, will be made if it is determined by the impact fee administrator that an overpayment of impact fees has occurred.

                  Sec. 47-24. - Credits. 
                  (a)  General conditions. Generally, an applicant may obtain credit for up to 100 percent of impact fees otherwise due or to become due by offering to dedicate land and/or construct improvements for county approved projects.

                  (3)  The authority to determine credit lies exclusively with the county. In every case impact fee credits shall be calculated so as to be consistent with O.C.G.A. § 36-71-1 through 13. 
                  (b)  General documentation and procedures. 
                  (1)  Application for credit in general.

                  b.  The method of attribution of any general costs to the improvement for which credit is requested. In no case shall the cost for design, engineering, contingencies and overhead constitute more than 15 percent of the credit granted. 
                  (3)  Application for credit for land dedication. 
                  a.  The impact fee administrator shall coordinate and consult with the county attorney in reviewing an application for land dedication and determine what documentation is needed for accepting an offer of dedication of land.

                  If the dedication is made pursuant to a condition of zoning approval, is not a project improvement and the zoning condition does not specifically prescribe otherwise, the land shall be valued based upon the zoning of the land as it existed prior to the zoning approval which contains the condition of dedication; or 
                  Otherwise, appraisers shall value the land at its then current zoning and without any enhanced value which could be attributed to improvements on adjacent lands. 
                  (4)  Determination and issuance of credits. If the county accepts such an offer, whether the acceptance is before or after the effective date of the appropriate impact fee ordinance, the credit shall be determined and provided in the following manner:

                  1.  The impact fee administrator shall determine credits for the dedication of land on the following values: 115 percent of the most recent assessed value by the county for purposes of property taxation; or at the option of the applicant, by fair market value determined by the impact fee administrator, based on an appraisal accepted by the impact fee administrator. 
                  2.  The impact fee administrator shall determine credits for the construction of a capital improvement from the engineering criteria and/or construction cost estimates as provided by the applicant and accepted by the impact fee administrator. 
                  c.  Issuance of credits.

                  (1)  All applications shall be accompanied by the following: 
                  a.  Unless waived by the director in recognition of the absence of any school or church buildings in proximity to the premises where non-traditional tobacco paraphernalia is to be sold, the application shall have attached a survey (dated no more than 180 days prior to submission of the application to the county), certified by a registered surveyor of this state, showing a scaled drawing of the premises, the location on the premises where the applicant desires to sell any item of non-traditional tobacco paraphernalia, and the distance in linear feet measured from the front door of the premise where any non-traditional paraphernalia is to be sold, to the property line of the tract upon which is located the nearest church building, school building, educational building, school grounds or college grounds or college campus building. 
                  For purposes of measuring the distance referred to in this subsection the following shall be employed; (1) from the front door of the premise which is regulated under this ordinance; (2) to the property line on the tract on which is located the church, school ground, or college campus; and (3) along a straight line which describes the shortest distance between the two points. 
                  b.  If the applicant is a partnership, a copy of the partnership agreement, including amendments, shall accompany the application. 
                  c.  If the applicant is a corporation, a copy of the articles of incorporation and by-laws, including amendments, shall accompany the application. 
                  d.  If the applicant is a nonprofit tax exempt civic, patriotic or social club or corporation which is organized and operated in the county as a mutual benefit membership group, a copy of the charter or articles of incorporation, as well as sufficient proof of the organization's tax exempt status shall accompany the application.

                  g.  As a prerequisite to the issuance of any license, the applicant shall furnish a complete set of fingerprints for all persons required to sign the application to be forwarded to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as specified under Georgia law. Each person required to sign the application for an original license and/or renewal license, must authorize the County of Forsyth or its designated representatives to secure from any state, county, municipal or federal court, any police department and/or law enforcement agency his, her or its criminal history and civil history and further authorize the county, its officers and employees to use such information in determining whether or not a license for the sale of any item of non-traditional tobacco paraphernalia will be issued to the applicant. Further, the applicant must authorize the county, its officers and employees to use such information in a public hearing if necessary, to determine whether or not the applicant's license should be denied, voided, cancelled and/or revoked. Each applicant waives any right or rights he, she or it may have under state or federal law, statute and/or court ruling to preclude the county from securing such criminal and/or civil history from any source and waives any right he, she or it may have to preclude the county from using such information publicly in determining whether the license will be issued to such applicant.

If the application is denied, or if the applicant withdraws the application prior to its approval, the license fee (without interest) shall be refunded to the applicant. All other fees paid to the county which were submitted as part of the application, including, but not limited to the investigative fee and any employee application permit fee(s) shall be retained by the county. 
                  i.  The director may require any additional information and records he reasonably deems necessary. Failure to furnish such data shall automatically serve to dismiss the application. Any misstatement or concealment of fact in the application shall be grounds for denying a license or revoking an issued license, and shall make the applicant liable to prosecution for perjury under the laws of the State of Georgia. 
                  j.  A valid email address and a valid mailing address that can be used for serving documents upon the applicant. 
                  k.  Each applicant shall certify that applicant has read and understands this chapter and if the license is granted, each licensee shall maintain a copy of this chapter on the premises and shall require each of the licensee's employees to be familiar with this chapter. 
                  (2)  No license for the sale of any item of non-traditional tobacco paraphernalia may be issued to an applicant under the following circumstances: 
                  a.  An applicant who is not at least 21 years old. 
                  b.  An applicant who has been convicted under any federal or state law of (1) a felony; or (2) any misdemeanor involving the usage, distribution, or possession of controlled substances, alcohol, or offenses involving moral turpitude within a five-year period immediately preceding application. For purposes of this subsection, a "conviction" shall include any plea of guilty or admission of guilt and subsequent sentence under the First Offender Act of O.C.G.A. §§ 42-8-60, 16-13-2 or 3-3-23.1(c), or any similar sentencing provision for first time offenders of any other state or of the United States. A plea of nolo contender for any felony or misdemeanor of any state or of the United States, or any municipal ordinance, except traffic violations, or the forfeiture of a bond (except traffic offenses) when charged with a crime is also considered a conviction under this chapter. 
                  c.  An applicant who has been held in civil or criminal contempt by any federal, state or local court if such citation indicates to the board of commissioners that the applicant will not maintain the outlet for which he is seeking a license in conformity with federal, state or local laws, rules, and regulations. 
                  d.  An applicant whom the director or the board determines, by reason of such applicant's business experience, financial standing, trade associations, personal associations, records of arrests, or reputation in any community in which he has resided, is not likely to maintain the outlet for which he is seeking a license in conformity with federal, state, or local laws. 
                  e.  An applicant who is not the owner of the premises for which the license is held or the holder of the lease thereon for the period covered by the license. The applicant for a license for the sale any item of non-traditional tobacco paraphernalia, whether it be an individual, a partnership, a corporation, a nonprofit tax exempt civic, patriotic, or social club, limited liability company, or a private club, shall be the owner of the premises for which the license is held or the holder of the lease thereon for the period covered by the license. If the premises are leased, then the applicant shall provide information regarding the owner or landlord of the premise. 
                  f.  An applicant who has had an application for a license denied under the provisions of this chapter within one year from the final date of such denial.

                  g.  An applicant who seeks to sell non-traditional tobacco paraphernalia in premises that are in or within 100 yards of any church building or in or within 200 yards of any school building, educational building, school grounds, or college campus. 
                  (3)  At the time the applicant makes application for a license, a sign shall be posted and furnished by Forsyth County and will be painted or printed in black letters one and one-half inches in height, against an orange background, on a two-face, back-to-back surface of not less than 24 × 30 inches in space, and shall be placed by Forsyth County with the base of the sign not more than three feet from the ground on the most conspicuous part of the premises. The sign shall state clearly the nature and purpose of the application, and the name of the person, partnership, organization, corporation or private club making the application. 
                  (4)  Once an application, the accompanying documents described above, and the required investigative and license fees are filed with Forsyth County, the Forsyth County Sheriff's Office shall conduct a criminal investigation of the application and produce a written criminal investigation report concerning all information relating to fingerprinting, criminal history, arrest data, and other matters pertaining to law enforcement. In the event the failure to obtain fingerprinting information from state and federal authorities delays completion of the written report, the sheriff's office may later supplement any fingerprinting information. If the fingerprinting information later reveals that the applicant fails to meet the requirements set by this chapter, this may be grounds for denying the application or revoking a license, despite an otherwise satisfactory written report. Upon production of the criminal investigation report, Forsyth County shall assemble the application forms and all accompanying documents relating to investigation and processing of the application and deliver such documents to the director for review. 
                  (5)  If the criminal investigation report shows that the applicant fails to meet the requirements set by this chapter, or if the director finds that the applicant fails to meet all other qualifications outlined by this chapter, then the director shall inform the applicant, in writing, that the application has been denied, and shall set forth in reasonable detail the reasons for the denial and shall notify the applicant of his/her right to appeal to the board of commissioners in accordance with section 50-6(c) of this chapter. If an applicant desires to appeal a denial by the director, the applicant must file a written request for an appeal hearing with the director within ten (10) business days of the date of the written notice informing the applicant of the denial by the director. 
                  (6)  Any application which the director determines to satisfy all the qualifications outlined in this chapter, including character requirements as contained in the criminal investigation report of the Forsyth County Sheriff's Office, shall be scheduled for review and a public hearing at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the board of commissioners. The public hearing shall be advertised in the county legal organ at least once - no less than 15 days prior to the date of said hearing. At that meeting, the applicant and any person opposed to said application has the right to present to the board of commissioners any information that the board of commissioners determines is relevant to the licensing decision. In making its determination on whether to approve or deny the application, the board of commissioners shall look to the qualifications set forth in this chapter and consider the public interest and welfare. The board shall have the sole discretion to grant or deny the application based on the information presented. A decision by the board of commissioners shall be made within 30 days from the date of the board of commissioners' meeting, unless the decision is postponed for purposes of the board obtaining additional information deemed necessary for consideration of the application. Notice of the decision by the board of commissioners shall be mailed or emailed to the applicant. In the event the application is denied, written notification of such denial shall set forth in reasonable detail the reasons for the denial and shall notify the applicant of his right to appeal as set forth in section 50-6(c). 
                  (7)  Upon approval by the board of commissioners of the application for a license, the director shall issue a license in accordance with the approved application. 
                  (c)  In the event the board of commissioners denies the application for a license, suspends a license, or revokes a license, the applicant for a license or the licensee whose license was suspended or revoked may appeal to the board of commissioners for reconsideration of the license denial, suspension or revocation by filing a written request for an appeal hearing with the director within ten (10) business days of the date of the written notice informing the applicant of the denial, suspension or revocation. Any such appeal hearing shall be conducted according to the procedures set forth in the subsection below. 
                  (1)  Upon receipt of a timely appeal (accompanied by a fee of $250.00 made payable to Forsyth County, Georgia), the director shall schedule a hearing before the board of commissioners or their appointee and provide written notice to the adverse party of the time, place and date of the scheduled hearing. The director shall also state in the written notice in reasonable detail the factual basis for the denial of the application or the suspension or revocation of the license. After notice of hearing, matters scheduled for hearing may only be continued by agreement of the director and the adverse party and/or counsel for the adverse party. 
                  (2)  The board of commissioners or their appointee shall have the duty of conducting hearings concerning the timely filed appeal of the denial, suspension, or revocation of a license. The standard of proof on all issues in the hearing shall be a preponderance of the evidence and a determination will be made on the basis of the competent evidence presented at the hearing. At its discretion, the board of commissioners may appoint a special master to conduct said hearing and make findings of fact and conclusions of law and report such findings and conclusions to the board of commissioners and to the director. 
                  (3)  At the hearing, the director or his or her designee shall present the facts upon which the denial, suspension, or revocation of the license were based. After presentation of the case against the adverse party, the adverse party will have an opportunity to present his/her case, to rebut the allegations made against him/her, and present whatever defenses he/she has. The adverse party shall have the right to be represented by an attorney, at the expense of the adverse party, and to present evidence and cross-examine opposing witnesses. 
                  (4)  At the conclusion of the hearing, the board of commissioners shall determine whether the denial, revocation, or suspension of the license was warranted. The findings and conclusions of the board of commissioners shall be forwarded to the director and it shall be the duty of the director to provide written notification to the adverse party of the actions of the board of commissioners. 
                  (5)  The decision of the board of commissioner shall be final unless appealed to the Superior Court of Forsyth County, Georgia, within 30 days of the director providing written notification to the adverse party of the board's decision. 
                  (6)  For purposes of this chapter, notice shall be deemed delivered when personally served, when served by certified mail postage prepaid, or when served by email within three days after the date of deposit in the United States Mail. 
                  (d)  All licenses granted under this chapter shall expire on December 31 of each year. An investigative fee of $350.00 shall be required for renewal applications pertaining to licenses that are to be issued for odd years in order to complete a criminal history report. In instances where a new, named licensee has been designated, a criminal history report and investigative fee shall be required regardless of the year. Persons holding a license for more than any one establishment and desiring to renew the license for such establishments shall pay only one investigative fee charge. Late applications will begin being processed at the time of receipt, but are not guaranteed renewal prior to January 1. If an application is submitted after January 31, a new application shall be required because renewal eligibility will not be considered past this date. 
                  (1)  For applications in which there are no changes of information and data contained in the original application, licensees shall file a renewal application accompanied by the requisite license fee with Forsyth County upon forms prescribed by the county on or before the second Monday in December of each year without penalty. Applications for renewal filed after the second Monday in December shall be subject to a late charge of ten percent of the license fee. These applications shall be processed by county staff and do not require a public hearing. 
                  (2)  Applications containing permissible changes as noted below must go before the board of commissioners for review and approval. Such applications must be submitted by October 1 of each year without penalty. Applications will be subject to a late charge of ten percent of the license fee if received after October 1. Permissible changes to applications are as follows: 
                  a.  New named licensee. 
                  b.  New license type. 
                  (3)  Applicants shall be required to file a new application if changes have occurred in the information and data furnished with the original application other than the permissible changes outlined above. Any changes to an applicant's criminal history will be subject to subsection (b) of section 50-6. 
                  (4)  Each application for renewal will show the date of the original application and that the applicant or applicants for the renewal are familiar with applicable Georgia laws and regulations and with the rules and ordinances of the county. The renewal application must be signed and sworn to by all applicants in the presence of a notary public or other officer authorized to administer oaths. The applicant will furnish all information required by the renewal application and failure to furnish the information will be grounds for denying the application. A false statement made on the renewal application will void the application and shall make the applicant liable to prosecution for false swearing under the laws of the State of Georgia. 
                  (5)  Each application for renewal of a license shall be approved or denied in accordance with the procedures prescribed in section 50-6 of this chapter, except that the public hearing for applications of renewal conducted before the board of commissioners will be held at the last regularly scheduled December meeting of the calendar year. 
                  (e)  No license for the sale of a non-traditional tobacco paraphernalia shall be transferable, except upon the death of a licensee, at which time such license may be transferred to the administrator, executor, or lawful adult heir or heirs of such deceased person. If the legal representatives of such deceased licensee cannot meet all the requirements of this chapter when the time arrives to renew the license, it shall not be renewed. Whenever a licensee doing business as a sole proprietorship loses its license as a result of the provision of this chapter, the licensee's successor in interest, upon filing an application for a new license, may continue to operate under the terms of the prior license until such time as the new application is approved or denied by the board of commissioners; provided, however, no such continued operation shall be authorized until such time as a new application for license is made and the required fees paid to Forsyth County to be forwarded to the director. Payment of fees shall not be required of a corporation whose predecessor in interest remains the named licensee under the new license. 
                  (f)  Any suspension, revocation, or forfeiture of a license by the board of commissioners shall occur only after notice and opportunity for a hearing before the board of commissioners consistent with the procedures set for in section 50-6(c), above, and upon the following occurrences: 
                  (1)  Any licensed outlet that is found to be in violation of this chapter shall be subject to license revocation or suspension and shall also be subject to citation and prosecution as outlined in section 50-6. 
                  (2)  Every license issued by the county for the sale of non-traditional tobacco paraphernalia shall be immediately revoked in case of bankruptcy, receivership, levy of legal process, or failure to promptly account for and pay the excise tax levied on the sale of nontraditional tobacco paraphernalia. 
                  (3)  Except as provided for transfers under section 50-6(f) above, any change in the ownership of any entity owning a licensed outlet shall cause the board of commissioners to immediately revoke any license issued under this chapter. 
                  (4)  All licensees must, within six months after the approval of said license, open for business the outlet referred to in the application for license, and begin the sale of the product or products authorized by the said license. Failure to open the outlet and begin the sales referred to within the six-month period, shall cause the board of commissioners to immediately revoke the license and no refund of any fees paid pursuant to this chapter shall be made. 
                  (5)  Any licensee who shall for a period of three consecutive months cease to operate the business and sale of the product or products authorized in the said license, shall, after said three months period, cause the board of commissioners to immediately revoke the license, and no refund of any fees paid pursuant to this chapter shall be made. 
                  (6)  A license may be immediately suspended or revoked by the board of commissioners upon learning that a licensee furnished fraudulent or untruthful information in the application for a license, or omits information required in the application for a license, or fails to pay all fees, taxes, or other charges imposed under the provisions of this chapter. 
                  (7)  Whenever the state shall revoke any permit or license to sell non-traditional tobacco paraphernalia, as is or may become applicable, the county license shall thereupon be immediately revoked. 
                  (8)  The board of commissioners shall immediately suspend or revoke the license of any outlet which does not meet the licensing qualifications set forth in this chapter at any time such knowledge becomes known to the board. 
                  (9)  The board of commissioners shall immediately revoke the license for any premises where non-traditional tobacco paraphernalia have been sold or distributed during a period of suspension.

                  Sec. 62-34. - Administration. 
                  The administrator shall administer and enforce the provisions of this article for the application for and issuance of permits under this article. 
                  (Ord. No. 34, § 4, 1-27-1987) 
                  Sec. 62-35. - Duties of administrator. 
                  The administrator, or an authorized representative, shall have, among others, the following duties: 
                  (1)  To prepare and provide the necessary forms for the application for a permit and for the submission of any required information as may be necessary to properly administer and enforce the provisions of this article. 
                  (2)  To review the application for completeness, collect whatever fee and escrow deposit may be required; to designate sites and set time schedules where more than one activity shall occur on the same day; to coordinate with City of Cumming authorities on all matters concerning such activities; and, where appropriate to receive the approval of the department of transportation, state highway patrol, and the sheriff, or any other necessary public officer, for the requested activity. 
                  (3)  To issue to the private organization or group of private persons a permit within a reasonable time of such approval. The administrator may, however, where he deems it appropriate, defer the issuance of a permit until the application for the permit shall have been approved by the board of commissioners. 
                  (Ord. No. 34, § 5, 1-27-1987) 
                  Sec. 62-36. - Procedure for issuance. 
                  (a)  If any provision of this article provides for the review of an application for a permit by a county officer designated therein, the administrator shall forward a copy of the application to that officer. The officer charged with the duty of reviewing the application shall make a recommendation thereon, favorable or otherwise, and shall return the recommendation to the administrator after receiving a copy of the application. 
                  (b)  Upon the receipt of the recommendation of the reviewing officer as provided in subsection (a) of this section, or upon the receipt of the application if no reviewing officer is designated, the administrator shall take action upon the recommendation and application; although, in a proper case, he may refer the application to the board of commissioners for consideration and action at its next public meeting. 
                  (c)  Unless some significant interference with the rights of nonparticipating citizens exists, the orderly flow of traffic would be obstructed unreasonably, the public safety would be endangered, or there would be other unreasonable interference with the public welfare, peace, safety, health, good order, and convenience of the general public, the permit shall be granted. Where more than one permit is sought for the same date, the administrator shall have authority to designate reasonable sites and set time schedules for the beginning and ending of the activity. The administrator shall have authority to cancel the permit where the activity fails to begin within a reasonable time after the time set for it to begin, based on other activities for which permits have been granted or based on the unreasonable interference caused by such delay with the public welfare, peace, safety, health, good order and convenience to the general public. As a condition to issuing a permit, the administrator may require the private organization or group of private persons to provide personnel for trash cleanup of affected areas littered during the activity for which a permit is sought, the provision of first aid and medical resources if considered necessary by the administrator, proof of sufficient storage areas for a large influx of motor vehicles occasioned by the permitted activity, provision of temporary toilet facilities and other similar special and extraordinary items considered to be necessary for the permitted activity in the opinion of the administrator, based on his past experience with such activities and his coordination with other county, city and state officials. In no event shall the administrator require private organizations or groups of private persons to provide personnel for normal governmental functions, such as traffic control and police protection. If additional requirements are placed on private organizations or groups of private persons in accordance with this subsection, and those requirements are not met despite assurances by such private organization or group of private persons, then such failure to comply with such requirements shall be grounds for denial of any subsequent permit requested by the private organization or group of private persons and for any other claims for funds expended by the county for those extraordinary expenses agreed to but not provided by the applicant. 
                  (d)  The administrator shall issue a permit to the applicant therefor, which permit shall state the nature of the activity authorized and bear the date of issuance and the signature of the administrator. 
                  (e)  Any applicant whose application for a permit under this article is denied by the administrator may appeal such denial to the board of commissioners, which shall consider such appeal at the regularly scheduled meeting next following the receipt of the applicant's appeal, if the applicant has submitted such appeal by the day items are to be placed on the agenda in accordance with normal procedures of the board of commissioners. If an applicant fails to appeal before the agenda is prepared, he may nevertheless be heard at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the board of commissioners if he has provided each of the commissioners a copy of the application which he submitted to the administrator and the reasons given by the administrator for the denial not less than 24 hours prior to the regularly scheduled meeting of the board of commissioners. The board of commissioners shall consider the appeal by requiring the administrator to explain why the permit was denied. Unless the administrator can show significant interference with the rights of nonparticipating citizens; an unreasonable obstruction of the orderly flow of traffic; a clear and present endangerment to citizens of the county; other specific unreasonable interference with the public welfare, peace, safety, health, good order, and convenience of the general public, or failure to comply with the dictates of this article, the permit shall be granted. 
                  (f)  In no event shall any private organization or group of private persons be permitted to bring signs, banners, posters, leaflets, handbills or any other printed material of any size or shape containing any message intended to influence any judge, juror, witness, or court officer, in the discharge of his duty at the county courthouse and the grounds upon which it stands. No private organization or group of private persons may use the county courthouse grounds for private purposes in holding a parade, assembly, demonstration, or other activity on any nonholiday weekday, prior to 5:00 a.m. or after 5:00 p.m. on any Saturday or public holiday, or prior to 1:00 p.m. or after 5:00 p.m. on any Sunday.

                  (a)  Criminal offenses. 
                  (1)  Violation of ordinance. Any person who violates nor fails to comply with any provision of this article shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be amenable to the processes of the superior court of the county, the state court of the county, or the magistrate court of the county. 
                  (2)  Punishment for violations. Any person or organization convicted of a misdemeanor for the violation of the terms of this article shall be punished as provided in section 1-12. 
                  (b)  Civil penalties. Any person, being an officer or employee of the county, who shall violate any provision of this article may be discharged from public service or employment or be subjected to such other disciplinary action as may be appropriate.

                  It shall be a defense to any prosecution under this article for failing to obtain a permit before engaging in any activity described in this article that a permit has in fact been issued in the manner provided by law. It shall be presumed that no permit has been issued unless, at his trial, the accused produces in court a valid permit or a certified copy thereof.

                  This article shall be subject to amendment or repeal, in whole or in part, at any time, and no amendment or repeal shall be construed to deny the right of the county to assess, levy and collect any permit fees prescribed. The payment of any permit fee provided for in this article shall not be construed as prohibiting the assessment, levy or collection of additional permit fees upon the same person.

In the case of condominiums, time-sharing plans, and other arrangements of multiple ownership, all persons owning any interest shall be equally responsible under this article together with the person exercising maintenance duties on the premises, if any.

                  DIVISION 1. - FINDINGS AND OBJECTIVES; GENERAL PROVISIONS 

                  Sec. 66-31. - Findings on the public health, safety, and welfare rationales of sign regulations. 
                  Building code requirements address many public concerns about dangerous signs. Appendix H of the 2012 International Building Code is supposed to ensure that they will not pose a fire hazard and are appropriately anchored or secured so that they do not fall or blow down. However, Appendix H does not regulate the location of signs, except to prevent them from interfering with an entryway, opening required for ventilation, or fire escape (International Building Code. 0121994. Appendix H, Section H103.1, Location Restrictions). 
                  Sign regulations achieve public safety rationales not achieved by the standard building code. Without a sign ordinance, signs can pose a clear danger to public safety. It has long been recognized that signage controls are needed to promote traffic safety and avoid traffic accidents. A 1980 Federal Highway Administration study found a positive correlation between billboards and accident rates (Scenic America. Fact Sheet (1): Billboard Control: Fighting Visual Pollution, http://www.scenic.org/factl.htm.). 
                  Signs too close to the road can cause accidents. Without additional regulation, signs can be placed dangerously close to rights-of-ways in locations where they might be struck by an oncoming vehicle using the road or having to veer off the road. 
                  Signs can impair visibility. The placement of signs can interfere with the sight of motorists trying to exit a driveway onto a public road. Traffic safety is improved by restricting the size, height, and spacing of signs. 
                  Signs distract motorists. By their very nature, signs are designed to direct attention to something and distract motorists to view a message or turn off the roadway and into a property to frequent a business, place, or activity. To the extent that signage captures the sight and attention of a motorist, it distracts motorists from the primary purpose of safely maneuvering a vehicle along the road. 
                  Signs can confuse motorists by mimicking traffic safety signals and signs. Motorists might confuse signs that contain flashing or blinking red, green, or yellow lights (such as a lighted portable sign adjacent to the road) with roadway traffic signals, emergency vehicles, or other hazards. Signs constructed of shapes like an octagonal "stop" sign might also impair public safety by confusing the motorist. 
                  Limitations on window signs can increase visibility from the public right-of-way and thus deter crime and robberies. Sign controls that limit the amount of storefront window and door areas that can be covered with signs enhance visibility of activities within the store or building. Limits on window signs can provide for an appropriate minimum of exterior visibility and thus increase public safety of commercial areas through a reduction in crime potential. 
                  Signs can degrade property values. A principal purpose of land use regulations, including sign controls, is to protect and preserve property values. There is no question that signs affect the character of districts and the value of buildings, or that they are not appropriate in different parts of a community. 
                  The size, height, materials of construction, location, condition, and attributes of signs can have an impact on surrounding and nearby land uses. For instance, if signs were unregulated, large, tall signs could be erected in the county's single family residential districts. Such signs, if erected, would be out of character with residential neighborhoods and could result in the lowering of property values for residential use. As another example, blighted signs and antiquated signs and sign structures (i.e., the pole with a blank structure for a sign face) can contribute to an overall image of blight and a reduction of property values in declining areas, if not addressed and removed via sign controls. Forsyth County's sign regulations are needed to ensure that signage is compatible with its surroundings and does not take away from the character of particular districts. 
                  Unregulated signage can degrade the utility of public safety signs. In some places, unregulated signs can reduce the effectiveness of signs needed to direct the public due to competition with other signs and the resulting reduction in visibility of public purpose signs. 
                  All other advertising mediums are regulated, so why not unavoidable impacts of advertising signs? The Federal Communications Commission regulates our air waves and television stations and the content that passes through them. Aside from the Highway Beautification Act of 1965, there is little if any federal involvement in the regulation of signs. This lack of federal regulation is interesting in the sense that signs are one of the most obtrusive forms of advertising. Signage is probably the only type of advertising that cannot be turned off or rejected by the consumer. Radio advertisements can be avoided by turning off the radio. The same is true with television advertisements; we flip channels or take a break when television commercials come on. Junk mail can be thrown away. We quickly flip past the advertisements in our favorite magazine when we are disinterested. Phone solicitations can be avoided with "caller identification" or terminating the conversation. The same cannot be said of outdoor advertising structures and commercial signs. One's vision of signage cannot be turned off. We are captivated by signage when we drive down the road. How do you avoid signs? We must keep our eyes open to drive and cannot block out signs from our peripheral vision. Perhaps one could take an alternative route that is not developed with signs, but that is not always feasible. Absent federal and significant state regulation, it is in the public interest for cities and counties to control signage. 
                  Signs derive their value from public improvements. Businesses locate, and signs are constructed, because of the access the community provides to business locations. It is precisely these types of advertising that are the principal target of local sign regulation - the signs controlled locally are those which are visible from public ways. It is the public way that creates the value for the person erecting the sign, and visibility from the public way is what creates the problems which give rise to the need for sign controls. This is a sound rationale for sign regulation. It logically follows that, because the public way provides value, the public therefore has a right, and indeed an obligation, to control the problems that arise from creating that value. 
                  Unregulated signs adversely impact public investments. Sign regulation helps to assure that public benefits derived from expenditures of public funds for the improvement and beautification of streets and other public structures and spaces are protected. Unregulated signs have the potential to negate those public investments, as well. 
                  (Ord. No. 74-O, § 1.1, 3-5-2015; Ord. No. 74-T, § 1, 7-14-2017) 
                  Sec. 66-32. - Findings on the business interest rationales of sign regulations. 
                  Sign regulation is in the interest of businesses. One often overlooked justification for the regulation of signs is that sign regulations benefit those businesses that seek to advertise. Unregulated competition among business results in too many signs and can reach a point of diminishing returns where individual business signs are not adequately visible. Patrons of individual businesses located along the unregulated commercial strip may miss their destination because they cannot find the particular business in the sea of signage. The unregulated commercial strip signage also can work to the detriment of individual businesses in that they are forced to erect larger and more costly signs to outdo their neighboring businesses and competitors. Therefore, sign regulations benefit individual business owners. 
                  The lack of sign controls causes uncertainty among prospective business owners. Forsyth County's sign ordinance provides prospective businesses with guidance on how much signage they may have, where it is allowed to be located and what types of signs are permitted. Without sign controls, business owners lack such guidance. Such a situation could have detrimental impacts on businesses, either through inequitable treatment or a delay in the time involved in the permitting of signs. Such potential detrimental impacts would not exist or would be mitigated with a clear set of sign regulations. 
                  (Ord. No. 74-O, § 1.2, 3-5-2015) 
                  Sec. 66-33. - Findings on the aesthetic rationales of sign regulations. 
                  There are many reasons to justify the county's sign ordinance. However, among the most relevant reasons are to promote and ensure the aesthetics of the community. In the earliest days of sign regulations, relying on aesthetics as a rationale could not legally justify local sign controls. The United States Supreme Court began a slow transformation, from its previous position that aesthetics alone could not justify land use regulations, to a position that aesthetic considerations were legitimately within the scope of police power. In 1954, Justice Douglas of the high court found the following: The concept of public welfare is broad and inclusive. The values it represents are spiritual as well as physical, aesthetic as well as monetary. It is within the power of the legislature to determine that the community should be beautiful as well as healthy, spacious as well as clean, well balanced as well as carefully controlled (Berman v Parker 348 U.S. 26, 75 S. Ct. 98, 99 L. Ed. 27 1954). 
                  Sign regulations help communities maintain their scenic heritage and unique character. Without Forsyth County's brand of sign regulation its commercial areas will likely end up looking like any other place. Signs can interfere with scenic views. The appearance of the community, which is substantially influenced by signs, is essential to the county's long-term economic viability and helps determine how residents and visitors alike perceive it. Sign control is an integral part of improving visual character and quality of life.

                  Sec. 66-34. - Objectives. 
                  The objectives of this article include but are not limited to the following: 
                  (a)  Provide a reasonable balance between the right of an individual to identify his or her business and the right of the public to be protected against the visual discord resulting from the unrestricted proliferation of signs and similar devices. 
                  (b)  Permit the reasonable dissemination of all forms of speech. 
                  (c)  To guard against an excess of large, ugly, intense signs which cause visual blight on the appearance of the county. Visual blight adversely affects the aesthetic quality of life and traffic safety in the county for residents, businesses, pedestrians, and persons in vehicles. 
                  (d)  Protect the public health, safety and general welfare while protecting the rights of sign owners to expression and identification. 
                  (e)  Promote economic development. 
                  (f)  Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs. 
                  (g)  Insure that signs are compatible with adjacent land uses and with the total visual environment of the community. 
                  (h)  Encourage signs that are well designed and compatible with their surroundings and with the buildings to which they are appurtenant, and encourage signs that are integrated with and harmonious to the buildings and sites they occupy. 
                  (i)  Eliminate excessive and confusing sign displays. 
                  (j)  Recognize that the size of signs that provide adequate identification in pedestrian-oriented business areas differs from those that are necessary in vehicular-oriented areas where traffic is heavy, travel speeds are greater, and required setbacks are greater than in pedestrian areas. 
                  (k)  Preserve and improve the appearance of the county as a place in which to live and to work and as an attraction to nonresidents who come to visit or trade. 
                  (l)  Encourage creative and well-designed signs that contribute in a positive way to the county's visual environment, express local character, and help develop a distinctive image for the county, and to discourage mediocre and poorly designed signs. 
                  (m)  Encourage new and replacement signage that is appropriately sized in its context so as to be easily readable. 
                  (n)  Encourage the construction, alteration, and repair of signs according to accepted and approved standards. 
                  (o)  Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations. 
                  (p)  Further the objectives of the county's comprehensive plan and the Unified Development Code.

                  Sec. 66-35. - Authority, adoption, and scope. 
                  This ordinance is adopted to serve substantial governmental interests of correcting and avoiding multiple problems that would occur without the regulation of signs. The regulations contained herein are no more extensive than necessary to serve the substantial governmental interests identified in this article. It is not the intent of this ordinance to apply regulation to signs based upon the message that they convey. It is not the intent of this article to foreclose important and distinct mediums of expression for political, religious or personal messages. Furthermore, it is not the intent of the county, nor any of its boards, commissions, or agents, to regulate, in any manner, the message content of signs, expect to the extent of obscenity or other messages prohibited by state or federal law.

It shall be the duty of the permittee or his agent to affix such sticker to the sign in the lower right hand area so it will be easily seen. The absence of a proper sticker shall be prima facie evidence that the sign has been, or is being, erected or operated in violation of the provisions of this article.

                  Violation of any provision of this article will be grounds for terminating the sign permit granted by the county to the owner and/or the occupation tax certificate of the person or entity erecting the sign. Except as otherwise provided in this article, no permit and/or occupation tax certificate shall be suspended, revoked or canceled except for cause as hereinafter defined, and the permittee is granted a public hearing before the board of commissioners. The permittee will be given ten days written notice of the time, place and purpose of the hearing, with a statement of the reason for the suspension, revocation or canceling of such permit and/or license. "Cause" is the willful and/or continued violation of the provisions of this article.

                  (2)  Notwithstanding the limitation set forth in section 66-111(1), if a commercially zoned property with frontage adjacent to the limited access portion of Georgia 400 applies for and secures a Vegetation Maintenance Permit from the State of Georgia, and if cutting, thinning, removal and/or reduction of vegetation along GA 400 right-of-way is implemented in full compliance with that permit, then that property may convert a single legal non-conforming sign whose primary purpose was to be viewed by the traveling public along GA 400 into two, single-faced replacement monument signs wherein the monument dimensions shall be no greater than ten feet in height and 44 feet in width; and where the monument sign face(s) shall be no greater than six feet in height and 25 feet in width. The converted monument sign(s) shall not be an electronic message board but may be externally lighted. In order to convert the existing non-conforming sign into two monument sign(s), an enhanced landscaping plan shall be submitted to and approved by the Forsyth County arborist, depicting enhanced landscaping and beautification on and around the replacement monument sign. Installation of such approved enhanced landscaping shall be included within the monument sign(s) building permit and shall be contemporaneous to construction of the monument sign(s). The existing legal non-conforming sign shall be removed prior to construction of the monument signs. Upon the monument sign(s) being installed, the former legal non-conforming sign that has been removed may not be re-erected and all rights to said sign and its status as a legal non-conforming sign shall be deemed abandoned. The monument signs authorized by this paragraph shall be allowed notwithstanding other limitations on the aggregate square feet of signage otherwise allowed on a parcel. 
                  (a)  The opportunity to convert a single legal non-conforming sign into two monument signs as provided in section 66-111(2) shall only be available to properties meeting the criteria set forth above, to include the existence of a legal non-conforming sign whose primary purpose is to be viewed by the traveling public along GA 400. A legal non-conforming sign whose primary purpose is to be viewed by the traveling public along GA 400 shall be a sign the erection of which is presently not allowed by the Forsyth County Code and whose height from grade to top is at least 50 feet. Section 66-111(2) shall not give rise to an independent right to an additional monument sign in the absence of a legal non-conforming sign satisfying the criteria in section 66-111(2) and (2)(a).

                  ARTICLE II. - WATER DISTRIBUTION STANDARDS 

                  Sec. 82-31. - Purpose and scope. 
                  (a)  The purpose of this article is to provide protection to the citizens of the county by ensuring that water distribution systems are adequate for fire protection, are sanitary, and are of sufficient size and quality to receive public water service as such becomes available. It is necessary to ensure that distribution systems are sufficient to become part of a wider distribution network than that existing at the time of installation. It is also necessary to consider water pressure variations resulting from elevation differentials within the county, the need to minimize water losses, and the need to minimize maintenance costs. 
                  (b)  This article shall apply to each and every water line installed below ground level in the unincorporated area of the county; provided, however, this article shall not apply to a water line installed by the owner of real property on his own property from a water source and serving not more than three dwelling units, or serving not more than two commercial or business establishments, or serving agricultural activities; and provided, further, that this exception shall not be available in any case where any portion of the water line is to be laid linearly within a public right-of-way, or a right-of-way required to be dedicated to the county under any ordinance, resolution, or other regulation. 
                  (c)  This article is passed with the specific knowledge that it contains standards more stringent than underground system installation standards present in the plumbing code now in effect. It is specifically the intention of this article to impose such more stringent standards, and subsequent amendments to plumbing codes now in effect, or adoption of other plumbing codes, shall in no way modify the standards of this article unless specifically stated in any such codes adopted in this article.

                  Sec. 82-34. - Fire hydrants. 
                  No water line shall be installed without incorporating therein fire hydrants of a type and manufacturer approved by the county water and sewerage authority. Such hydrants shall be installed not more than 1,000 feet apart as measured along the line installed. The first hydrant shall be installed within 500 feet of an existing hydrant measured by line-of-sight distance if the new installation branches from an existing water line. The first hydrant shall be installed within 1,000 feet of an existing hydrant measured linearly along the existing and installed line if the new installation constitutes a continuation of the existing line. If neither of those conditions exist, then the first hydrant shall be installed not more than 100 feet from the point at which the water will enter the new installation. Should the county water and sewerage authority fail to maintain a list of approved types and manufacturers of fire hydrants, then and in that event the type and manufacturer of the hydrant proposed for installation shall be approved by the board of commissioners prior to installation.

                  The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 403 and 405—471 are hereby incorporated. 
                  (1)  Where a categorical pretreatment standard categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c). 
                  (2)  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the director may impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
                  (3)  A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. 
                  (4)  A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with CFR 403.15. 
                  (5)  Upon the promulgation of a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard for a particular pretreatment standard for a particular industrial subcategory, the national standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this article for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this article. All affected significant industrial users shall be subject to applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR 403.12. Users shall immediately notify the POTW of slug discharges, including any discharge that would violate a prohibition under 40 CFR 403.5(b) and then provide written notification within five days to the POTW according to federal regulations. 
                  (6)  State limits. Users must comply with any applicable State of Georgia Pretreatment Standards. 
                  (7)  Local limits. The following table lists the local limits adopted by Forsyth County. User discharge concentrations apply at the point where the waste is discharged to the sewage works. No person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the following maximum allowable discharge limits: 
                  Daily and monthly average maximum concentrations (composite sample, unless otherwise noted): 

                   
                  Upon providing notice to affected persons, the county may impose maximum industrial discharge limitations in addition to, or in place of, the local limitations above. The county further reserves: (i) the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the sewage works, and (ii) the right to revoke an industrial user's discharge permit, where, in the opinion of the director, such action or actions appear necessary in order for the POTW to achieve or maintain compliance with applicable state or federal standards, or in order for the director to promote the purposes and policies of this article. 
                  (8)  "Normal" domestic wastewater concentrations, surcharge ranges, and daily maximum allowable concentrations for conventional pollutants. The following table lists concentrations for "normal" wastewater, concentration ranges used by the county for levying surcharges (where the same value appears in two ranges, the lower range will be used), and the daily maximum concentration allowed before a fine is levied by the county in addition to the treatment surcharge: 

                   
                  Recommended Daily pH Fines Daily Flow (gpd)

                  (a)  Industrial users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this article, and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in this article within the time limitations specified by EPA, the state, or Forsyth County, whichever is more stringent. All facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to Forsyth County for review, and shall be acceptable to the director before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the county under the provisions contained herein. 
                  (b)  Prohibition of bypass. Except as otherwise provided in this article, bypass is prohibited and persons who cause bypass are subject to enforcement by the county. Upon reduction of efficiency of operation or loss or failure of all or part of the treatment facility, the permittee shall, to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with its permit, and applicable laws and regulations, control its production or discharges (or both) until operation of the treatment facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies, without limitation, when the primary source of power of the treatment facility fails or is reduced. It shall not be a defense for a permittee in an enforcement action that it would have been necessary to halt or reduce the permitted activity in order to maintain compliance with permit conditions. 
                  (c)  Exceptions for Bypass. Notwithstanding the foregoing, bypass is permissible in the following circumstances: 
                  (1)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause applicable pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only where necessary for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the notice provisions contained in subsection (d) below. 
                  (2)  Provided that notice is given by the user to the county in accordance with subsection (d) below, bypass is permitted where, in the opinion of the director: (i) the bypass is unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage, (ii) allowing the bypass does not appear likely to result in loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage, (iii) the bypass appears unlikely to cause a failure (a) by the POTW to achieve or maintain compliance with applicable state or federal standards, or (b) by the director to promote the purposes and policies of this article; and (iv) there are or were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment down time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, bypass is prohibited if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment down time or preventive maintenance. 
                  (d)  Notice of bypass. 
                  (1)  If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, the user shall submit written notification to the county at least ten days before the date of the bypass and receive approval from the county prior to the bypass. Bypasses are prohibited during periods of wastewater treatment plant upset. 
                  (2)  An industrial user shall submit oral notice to the county of any unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards immediately upon becoming aware of the bypass. 
                  (3)  A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass, including: 
                  a.  The exact dates and times of the bypass; 
                  b.  The exact cause and a description of the bypass; 
                  c.  If the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and 
                  d.  Steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.

                  Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and related requirements shall submit to the director a report containing the information described in section 82-70(a)(6) and (7) and 82-81(b)(2) of this article. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in section 82-58 (See 40 CFR403.6(c)), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 82-94(a) of this article. All sampling will be done in conformance with section 82-91.

                  Sec. 82-84. - Periodic compliance reports. 
                  (a)  All significant industrial users must, at a frequency determined by the director submit no less than twice per year (June and December) reports indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the director or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. 
                  (b)  Forsyth County may authorize an industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the industrial user, (See 40 CFR 403.12(e)(2)). This authorization is subject to the following conditions: 
                  (1)  The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater. 
                  (2)  The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case longer than five years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit (see section 82-70(a)(8)). 
                  (3)  In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes. 
                  (4)  The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance with section 82-94(b), and include the certification statement in section 82-94(a) (40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)(ii)). 
                  (5)  Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis. 
                  (6)  Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the director must be included as a condition in the user's permit. The reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the director for three years after expiration of the waiver. 
                  (7)  Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the user's permit by the director, the industrial user must certify on each report with the statement in section 82-94(b) below, that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the industrial user. 
                  (8)  In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is expected to be present because of changes that occur in the user's operations, the user must immediately: Comply with the monitoring requirements of section 82-84(a), or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the director, and notify the director. 
                  (9)  This provision does not supersede certification processes and requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard.

                  Sec. 82-85. - Reports of changed conditions. 
                  Each user must notify the director of any significant changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least ten days before the change. 
                  (a)  The director may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under section 82-70 of this article. 
                  (b)  The director may issue an individual wastewater discharge permit under section 82-79 of this article or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under section 82-76 of this article in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.

                  Sec. 82-86. - Reports of potential problems. 
                  (a)  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that might cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the director of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
                  (b)  Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the director, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article. 
                  (c)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a discharge described in paragraph (a), above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
                  (d)  Significant industrial users are required to notify the director immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge.

                  Sec. 82-88. - Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. 
                  If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the director within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. Resampling by the industrial user is not required if Forsyth County performs sampling at the user's facility at least once a month, or if Forsyth County performs sampling at the user between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or Forsyth County receives the results of this sampling, or if Forsyth County has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user. 
                  If Forsyth County performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, Forsyth County will perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the user of the violation and requires the user to perform the repeat sampling and analysis (See 40 CFR 403.12(g) (2)). 
                  (Ord. No. 114-A, 11-2-17) 
                  Sec. 82-89. - Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
                  (a)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section 82-85 of this article. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 82-81, 82-83, and 82-84 of this article. 
                  (b)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a), above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
                  (c)  In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the director, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
                  (d)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
                  (e)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

                  Sec. 82-90. - Analytical requirements. 
                  All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the director or other parties approved by EPA. 
                  (Ord. No. 114-A, 11-2-17) 
                  Sec. 82-91. - Sample collection. 
                  Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. The county establishes the frequency of monitoring necessary to assess and assure compliance by the user with applicable pretreatment standards and related requirements in the user's individual wastewater discharge permit. 
                  (a)  Except as indicated in subsections (b) and (c) below, the user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the director. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by Forsyth County, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: For cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by Forsyth County, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to characterize batch discharges or slug discharges or to show compliance with instantaneous limits. 
                  (b)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
                  (c)  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in sections 82-81 and 82-83 (See 40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)), a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the director may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by section 82-84 (40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by with applicable pretreatment standards and related requirements.

                  DIVISION 14. - ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES 

                  Sec. 82-106. - Notification of violation. 
                  When the director finds that any user or person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may serve upon such user or person a written notice of violation. Within seven days of the receipt of this notice, such user or person shall submit to the director (i) an explanation of the violation; (ii) a plan for satisfactory corrective action with regard to such violation; and (iii) a plan for prevention of recurrence of such violation. Submission of this plan in no way relieves such user or person of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in the section shall limit the authority of the director to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.

                  Sec. 82-107. - Consent orders. 
                  The director is hereby authorized to enter into consent agreements, consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user or person responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user or person to correct the noncompliance with a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections 82-109 and 82-110 of this article and shall be enforceable in a court of law.

                  Sec. 82-108. - Show cause hearing. 
                  The director may order any user or person which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the director and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on such user or person specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that such user or person show cause why the proposed enforcement should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 30 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of such user or person. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking other action against such user or person.

                  Sec. 82-109. - Compliance orders. 
                  When the director determines that any user or person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may issue an order to such user or person responsible for the discharge directing that such user or person come into compliance within a specified time. If such user or person does not come into compliance within the time provided, the director may discontinue sewer service. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve any user or person of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, the director taking any other action against such user or person.

                  Sec. 82-110. - Cease and desist order. 
                  (a)  When the director determines that any user or person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the past violations of such user or person are likely to recur, the director may issue an order to such user or person directing it to cease and desist all such violations and to: 
                  (1)  Immediately comply with all applicable requirements; and 
                  (2)  Take such appropriate corrective, remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address any violation (including without limitation, any continuing or threatened violation), including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
                  (b)  Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for taking any other action against such user or person.

                  Sec. 82-110.1. - Administrative fines. 
                  (a)  When the county finds that any user or person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the county may fine such user or person in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00, per violation, and in the case of an industrial user, $1,000.00, per violation, per day. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
                  (b)  Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 15 days be assessed an additional penalty of 12 percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of the greater of two percent per month or the rate specified for interest on investments of the EPA Hazardous Substance Superfund established by 26 U.S.C. § 9507 (and set forth at: http://www.epa.gov/ocfo/finstatement/superfund/int_rate.htm). A lien against the property of such user or person will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties. 
                  (c)  The director may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. 
                  (d)  To the extent permitted by state statute, issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for taking any other action against such user or person.

                  Sec. 82-110.2. - Emergency suspensions. 
                  (a)  The director may immediately suspend the discharge of any user or person, after informal notice to such user or person, whenever such suspension appears necessary, in the opinion of the director, to abate an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, cause, or contribute to an imminent or substantial endangerment to human health and safety or the environment. 
                  (1)  Any user or person notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a failure by such user or person to immediately comply with the suspension order, the director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize harm or threatened harm or endangerment to the POTW, its receiving stream, or to human health and safety or the environment. The county may allow such user or person to recommence its discharge when such user or person has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in section 82-110.3 are initiated against such user or person. 
                  (2)  Any user or person responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrences, to the director prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under sections 82-108 and 82-110.3 of this article. 
                  Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.

                  Sec. 82-110.3. - Termination of discharge and/or potable water supply. 
                  Any user or person who violates any of the following conditions is subject to termination of discharge and/or potable water supply: 
                  (1)  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
                  (2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
                  (3)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
                  (4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the premises of such user or person for lawful purposes, including without limitation, inspection, monitoring, or sampling; 
                  (5)  Violation of the pretreatment standards in division 5 of this article; 
                  (6)  Discharges wastewater at an uncontrolled, variable rate in sufficient quantity to cause an imbalance in the wastewater treatment process; 
                  (7)  Fails to pay monthly bills for sanitary sewer service when due; 
                  (8)  Repeats a discharge of prohibited wastes into public sewers; 
                  (9)  Acids or chemicals damaging to sewer lines or treatment process are released into the public sewer causing rapid deterioration of these structures or interfering with proper conveyance and treatment of wastewater; or 
                  (10)  Governmental agency informs Forsyth County that the effluent from the county's wastewater treatment plant is no longer of a quality permitted for discharge into a watercourse, and it is found that the customer, user or person is discharging such wastewater effluent into the public sewer in a manner that cannot be sufficiently treated or requires treatment that is not provided by Forsyth County as normal domestic treatment. 
                  Such user or person will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and/or potable water supply and be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 82-108 of this article why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the director shall not be a bar to, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against such user or person.

A notice of appeal shall state the specific reason why the order or action of the director is alleged to be in error. 
                  (b)  If the director does not reverse his or her decision within 30 days of receiving a timely written notice of appeal, then such user or person may within seven days, appeal to the Forsyth County Board of Commissioners (the "board"). The hearing shall be held within the next two meetings of the board or a date mutually agreed upon in writing by the appellant and the chair of the board. The board shall then make its findings within 30 days of the appeal hearing. The appellant shall not be relieved of his obligations during the appeal process. 
                  (c)  If the appellant is dissatisfied with the board's decision, the appellant may then appeal the decision to the county superior court.

                  Sec. 82-110.10. - Sewer service charge. 
                  (a)  Established. It is hereby determined to be necessary, in order to provide facilities for the protection of the public health, safety, welfare, and to comply with applicable water quality laws and regulations for the protection of the quality of the waters of the state, to fix and collect charges upon all premises or facilities served by the water pollution control facilities of the county. 
                  (b)  Determination of amounts. There is hereby charged and assessed to each property, premises or facility served by the water pollution control facilities of the county, or otherwise discharging wastewater, industrial wastes, water or liquids, either directly or indirectly into the water pollution control facilities, a sewer service charge and assessment payable as hereinafter provided, and in the amount determinable as follows: 
                  (1)  The sewer service charge shall be based upon the quantity of water used by the premises or facility therein or thereon as measured by a water meter or meters there in use, or as otherwise currently established. 
                  (2)  The sewer service charge shall consist of a charge per thousand gallons of water consumed, including adjustments thereto, plus the fixed costs. Rates shall be established for each customer class. 
                  (3)  Reserved. 
                  (4)  Any customer that discharges wastewater that is produced on site, including without limitation, landfill leachate, shall meter all wastewater at the point of discharge to the sewer collection system, and the sewer service charge will be calculated from that metered flow. 
                  (c)  Reserved. 
                  (d)  Additional meters. Where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the director that a significant portion of the water used by customers, as measured by the water meter or meters does not enter the water pollution control facilities, then that portion of water shall not be used for billing of the sewer service charge. The director may require or permit the installation of additional meters or other devices as may be deemed necessary to establish that portion which does not enter the system.

Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the EPA pursuant to Section 304(g) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR, Part 136 as amended. Composite samples shall be representative of discharge due to normal operations. To determine the characteristics of a representative sample used in the calculation of an annual surcharge, a minimum, three representative composite samples shall be made. Sample results shall be averaged using a flow-weighted average to determine the overall average concentration for use in billing the industrial surcharge. Grab samples (of slug, batch, bypass, accidental or other episodic discharges) taken in accordance with 40 CFR 136 shall be taken to measure such constituents and characteristics as may be required by applicable law or as reasonably required by the director. Analysis of parameters, including but not limited to COD, TSS, TKN, Total Phosphorus (as P), BOD 5 , COD, Ammonia Nitrogen, Chloride, pH and priority pollutants (Appendix A to 40 CFR, Part 423-126, as amended) may be performed on grab samples to characterize the discharge. Analytical results from a certified laboratory, of a properly preserved grab sample, may be used to determine surcharges, fines and enforcement actions related to, but not limited to, slug discharges or batch discharges, including analytes that are typically composite sampled. The discharger may request split samples for their own independent analysis by a certified lab. 
                  (c)  Reporting requirements. The timely submission of all notices and self-monitoring reports from industrial users as are necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with pretreatment standards and related requirements, or as required in the discharge permit, including but not limited to the reports required in § 403.12 are the responsibility of the user.

                  Sec. 86-54. - Tree protection standards. 
                  The following section establishes standards by which plans and field conditions are to be evaluated to determine compliance with the Forsyth County Tree Protection and Replacement Ordinance. 
                  (a)  Protection of existing trees. If trees are existing on the site, the required density (see section 86-61) should be met with those trees. If this cannot be done, replacement trees are required. A tree protection and/or replacement plan must be a part of the approved land disturbance plan (refer to section 86-58 for specific requirements of a tree protection and/or replacement plan). When a choice is available as to which existing trees to save, significant trees, even isolated individual trees, should be given preference over other trees. Non-significant trees, however, should be saved in stands rather than as individual trees scattered over a site. 
                  (b)  Tree inventories and surveys. All trees that are to be counted toward meeting density requirements must be inventoried. Existing trees within buffers may not be counted toward the required site density factor. On sites greater than three acres, all trees counted must be inventoried using an approved scientific method (e.g., Basal Area). On sites three acres or less, all trees need to be individually counted. 
                  Significant trees must be shown on the tree protection and/or replacement plan with an indication whether they are to be retained or removed. Approximate locations are acceptable. 
                  (c)  Plan review standards. 
                  1.  All tree save areas must be delineated on the tree protection and/or replacement plan along with a designation whether protection during construction is to be active or passive as set forth in section 86-54(e). 
                  2.  The method used to inventory the trees must be indicated on the plans. 
                  3.  All buffers must be identified on the tree protection and/or replacement plan. 
                  (d)  Construction standards. Tree protection devices are necessary to eliminate activities detrimental to trees including but not limited to: 
                  1.  Soil compaction in the critical root zone from heavy equipment, vehicular or excessive pedestrian traffic, or storage of equipment or materials; 
                  2.  Root disturbance due to cuts, fills or trenching; 
                  3.  Wounds to exposed roots, trunks or limbs; 
                  4.  Other activities such as chemical storage, cement truck cleaning, fire, etc. 
                  (e)  Location and types of tree protection devices. Tree protection devices are to be installed as shown on the tree protection and/or replacement plan or otherwise completely surrounding the critical root zone of all trees to be preserved. Active protection is required where tree save areas are located in proximity to construction activity. Passive protection may be used in more remote locations and in all tree protection areas not designated as tree save areas as determined by the director. Once tree protection areas are established and approved, any changes are subject to department of planning and development review. 
                  (f)  Materials. 
                  1.  Active tree protection shall consist of chain link, orange laminated plastic, wooden post, rail fencing or other equivalent restraining material (See Detail 3—Active Tree Protection). 
                  2.  Passive protection shall consist of heavy mill plastic flagging of a bright color or equivalent signage on a continuous, durable restraint sufficient to delineate the bounds of any tree protection or save areas (See Detail 2—Passive Tree Protection). 
                  (g)  Sequence of installation and removal. All tree protection devices shall be installed prior to any land-disturbing activity. The department of planning and development will inspect the installation of tree protection devices. It shall be the sole responsibility of the property owner and/or developer to ensure that all tree protection devices remain in functioning condition throughout all phases of development. In the event passive tree protection is not kept in functioning condition, active tree protection may be required throughout the project. 
                  (h)  Other specifications. 
                  1.  Where clearing has been approved, trees shall be removed in a manner that does not adversely impact the trees to be preserved. Avoid felling trees into tree protection areas or disturbing roots inside the tree protection areas. 
                  2.  All erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be installed so that sediment will not accumulate within the tree protection area. 
                  3.  All tree protection areas shall be designated as such with "Tree Protection Area" signs posted visibly on all sides of the fenced-in area. These signs are intended to inform subcontractors of the tree protection process. Signs requesting subcontractor cooperation and compliance with the tree protection standards are recommended for site entrances. 
                  (Ord. No. 98-C, § 2.4, 2-5-2015) 
                  Sec. 86-55. - Tree replacement standards. 
                  The following section establishes standards by which tree protection and/or replacement plans and field conditions are to be evaluated to determine compliance with the Forsyth County Tree Protection and Replacement Ordinance. 
                  Tree protection and/or replacement plans should be prepared with appropriate consideration given to the function of trees in the urban landscape. Every effort should be made to maximize the environmental benefit of the plant material. 
                  Trees selected for planting must be free from injury, pests, disease, nutritional disorders or root defects, and must be of good vigor in order to assure a reasonable expectation of survivability. 
                  Standards for transplanting shall be in keeping with those established in the International Society of Arboriculture publication, "Tree and Shrub Transplanting Manual" or similar publication. Reference the American Association of Nurserymen publication "American Standard for Nursery Stock" (ANSI Z60,l) for plant material quality specifications. Reference the "Manual for Woody Landscape Plants" (Michael A. Dirr) or similar publication for information on tree species site requirements. 
                  (a)  Tree planting standards. 
                  1.  Always pick a tree up by the container or root ball, never by the trunk. 
                  2.  The hole should be a minimum of one and one-half times the width of the root ball with sloped sides. 
                  3.  The depth of the hole should be no deeper than the height between the bottom of the root ball and the trunk flare. 
                  4.  Once the tree is placed in the hole, the burlap and wire basket must be removed a minimum of 12 inches from the top of the root ball. 
                  5.  Backfill soil should not be amended. 
                  6.  Stake only if necessary. 
                  (b)  Species. Species selected as replacement trees must be quality species, and must be ecologically compatible with the intended-growing site. Ornamental species are acceptable for use in meeting density requirements only with prior approval from the director and only for the replacement of understory trees. 
                  (c)  Minimum root zones. In order to provide sufficient growing area for planted trees, the following minimum criteria must be observed unless otherwise approved by the director: 

                   
                  (Ord. No. 98-C, § 2.5, 2-5-2015) 
                  Sec. 86-56. - Special requirements. 
                  The following classifications will be required to comply with these special requirements in addition to the standard requirements of this article: 
                  (a)  Residential zoning district. 
                  1.  The site density factor for development in residential zoning districts shall be met by preserving or replacing trees in common areas, rear and exterior setbacks, and other areas that are not to be disturbed during house construction. 
                  2.  Each single family residential lot shall contain a minimum of two trees, at least one of which must be located in the front yard. Corner lots shall contain a minimum of three trees with at least one tree located in each yard abutting the streets. The required trees must be a minimum of two-inch caliper size and be an overstory hardwood species. Where planting space is limited or an overstory tree would not be compatible with the intended growing site, the use of understory species may be approved on a case by case basis as determined by the director. Existing or replacement trees may be used to satisfy this requirement. The trees may be counted toward the required site density factor for the project. 
                  (b)  Commercial and industrial zoning districts subdivisions. Subdivisions in commercial and industrial zoning districts require the site density factor to be shown on the as built. At the time of site development, each lot must submit a tree protection and/or replacement plan indicating compliance with the tree protection and replacement ordinance. Specimen tree liability shall be assessed against the entire development on a prorated per Lot basis. 
                  (Ord. No. 98-C, § 2.6, 2-5-2015; Ord. No. 98-D, 4-13-2017) 
                  Sec. 86-57. - Location of trees within a development (this section does not apply to single family development). 
                  Forsyth County has given priority to the retention and placement of trees in frontage planting strips and parking lot planting islands. Trees retained or placed in these areas may be used to meet the site density factor for a project. However, if the site density factor is met with trees saved or planted in other areas, the tree location guidelines outlined below must still be performed with additional tree plantings. 
                  (a)  Frontage planting strips. Planting strips shall meet the minimum depth requirements as indicated in the following table. Trees equivalent to at least one tree density unit (see Table A) for every 75 linear feet of length shall be saved or planted in such strips (trees may be planted in groups rather than in a single line). Any trees placed between the right-of-way line or utility easement and the construction area (the buildings, accessory uses, or parking area) may be considered to be in the planting strips. (See Appendix A, Detail One—Frontage Planting Strips) 

                   
                  (b)  Landscape islands. Landscape islands shall be provided within parking areas (but not within vehicle storage, maneuvering, or display areas) as follows: 
                  1.  Landscape islands shall be located at the end of every parking bay and at every 150 linear feet of continuous parking space. Measuring from the trunk, the tree must be a minimum of six feet from the back of the curb. No portion of an island less than three feet in width may be counted in the area. Landscape islands for single parking bays shall contain a minimum of 200 square feet. Landscape islands for double parking bays shall require a minimum of two 200-square foot islands or one continuous landscape island of 400 square feet. 
                  2.  Landscape islands shall be located in such a manner as to divide and break up the parking area. A planting area, which intrudes upon or is located wholly within a generally rectangular area that is (a) devoted to parking and (b) between a building and a Lot line or between two buildings will generally serve this purpose. 
                  3.  At least one overstory tree shall be planted in every landscape island. 
                  4.  Method of irrigation shall be indicated on the tree protection and/or replacement plan.

                  Sec. 86-58. - Tree protection and/or replacement plan requirements. 
                  Tree protection and/or replacement plans shall be prepared by a professional landscape architect, urban forester, or arborist in accordance with the specifications for such plans contained herein. The performance of professional services in the preparation of plans required herein shall comply with Georgia Law governing the practice of the applicable profession. When the planting of replacement trees is not required to meet the site density factor, licensed professionals (e.g. architects, engineers, surveyors, etc.) may be authorized by the director to prepare the tree protection and/or replacement plan, provided that they demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the director, competency and knowledge in the principles and practices of arboriculture. 
                  The tree protection and/or replacement plan shall be shown on a copy of a site plan, as appropriate to the proposed development, drawn to the same scale as the other plan documents prepared for a land disturbance permit application on the property, and shall cover the same area. 
                  After the submission of the plan, the director will perform a site walk. The tree protection and/or replacement plan shall provide sufficient information and detail to clearly demonstrate that all applicable requirements and standards of this article will be fully satisfied.

                  (n)  The following notes: See Appendix A. 
                  (Ord. No. 98-C, § 2.9, 2-5-2015) 
                  Sec. 86-60. - Plan review procedures. 
                  The department of planning and development administers the Forsyth County Tree Protection and Replacement Ordinance. The director is the primary tree plan reviewer, and is responsible for making professional judgments regarding any arboricultural principles or practices related to the implementation of this article. 
                  (a)  Pre-submittal conference. Developers and design professionals are encouraged to meet with the director and/or other department of planning and development professional staff prior to submitting a tree protection and/or replacement plan. The director is available for field inspections of site conditions prior to submittal to give advice as to the relative value of trees, and to assist in the tree protection and/or replacement plan development process as it relates to preserving trees. Information can also be disseminated about how to prepare a tree protection and/or replacement plan. 
                  (b)  Land disturbance permit. Tree protection and/or replacement plans shall be submitted with other permit drawings as part of the plan approval and/or land disturbance permit process as required in the Unified Development Code. The department of planning and development shall review these plans for conformance with the tree protection and replacement ordinance in the manner specified in the Unified Development Code. 
                  (Ord. No. 98-C, § 2.10, 2-5-2015) 
                  Sec. 86-61. - Density requirements. 
                  The quantity of total existing and replacement trees on a site must be sufficient so as to produce a total site density of no less than: 
                  • Fifteen units per acre for property in commercial and industrial zoning districts; 
                  • Eighteen units per acre for planned commercial developments or mixed use developments (wherein the commercial component of the mixed use exceeds 50 percent of the development) that meet or exceed the threshold for developments of regional impact ("DRI"); 
                  • Twenty units per acre for property in residential zoning districts. 
                  The site density factor shall be calculated using the total acreage from disturbed areas. Units should be distributed throughout the development and not located in only one area. Site density calculation for mixed use development will be based on land use as determined by the director. Procedures for determining the site density requirements and subsequent tree replacements are provided in Appendix B. 
                  (Ord. No. 98-C, § 2.11, 2-5-2015) 
                  Sec. 86-62. - Significant trees. 
                  Some trees on a site warrant special consideration and encouragement for protection. These trees are referred to as significant trees. Significant trees are composed of specimen, historic, and landmark trees. Criteria for determining specimen, historic, and landmark trees can be found in Appendix C. 
                  To obtain credit as a significant tree, significant trees are to be protected in their natural state, free from damage. In order to encourage protection of significant trees and the incorporation of these trees into the design of projects additional density credit will be given for significant trees that are successfully saved. Credit for any significant tree saved will be four times the assigned unit value shown in Table A, Appendix B "Trees to Remain on Site." Significant trees that need to be removed require a plan or written documentation indicating the reason for removal to be submitted to the department of planning and development prior to the removal. Specimen trees removed with prior approval from the department of planning and development must be replaced at the rate of one unit for each unit awarded it in Table A, Appendix B, in addition to the minimum site density factor in recompense for their removal. Specimen trees must be replaced by species with similar characteristics. If a specimen, historic or landmark tree is damaged or removed without prior approval by the director, recompense or penalty will be required or imposed as follows: 
                  (a)  Any specimen tree that is removed without the appropriate review and approval of the director must be replaced by trees with a total density equal to twice the unit value of the tree removed. Size alone will determine whether a tree was of specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval and there is no evidence of its condition. 
                  (b)  If a historic or landmark tree is damaged or removed without prior approval of the director, the department of planning and development will require replacement by trees with a total density equal to eight times the unit value of the tree removed. 
                  (c)  In the event the director determines a specimen, historic or landmark tree is a hazard to property, power lines or people the tree may be removed without recompense or penalty. 
                  Replacement of specimen trees removed shall not be required for planned commercial developments or mixed use developments (wherein the commercial component of the mixed use exceeds 50 percent of the development) that meet or exceed the threshold for developments of regional impact ("DRI"). 
                  (Ord. No. 98-C, § 2.12, 2-5-2015) 
                  Sec. 86-63. - Alternative compliance. 
                  Where the minimum density requirements cannot be fully met, due to site conditions, the applicant must have the approval of the director, to make a contribution to the Tree Replacement Fund of Forsyth County. Such contributions will be used for the sole purpose of planting trees on public property. Contribution to the tree replacement fund must have the approval of the director and be paid in full prior to the issuance of any permit. 
                  The tree replacement fund is to act as an "emergency relief valve" and is to be utilized at the county's discretion. When it has been determined the required site density factor cannot be met with residual or planted trees, a contribution equal to $400.00 per unit for each unit short of the requirement must be paid into the tree replacement fund by the developer. 
                  (Ord. No. 98-C, § 2.13, 2-5-2015) 
                  Sec. 86-64. - Maintenance period for development in commercial and industrial zoning districts. 
                  Trees, which are used to meet the density requirements, shall be maintained for one full growing season after the date of final inspection. After one full growing season a maintenance inspection will be performed by the director to determine if the project is still in compliance with the tree protection and replacement ordinance. Any trees planted to meet the required site density requirement, which are dead or near death must be replaced. Trees protected to meet the required site density which are dead or near death at the time of the maintenance inspection must be replaced if there is evidence that the demise of such trees was due an act or omission that caused the tree to deteriorate. 
                  Any trees required to be replaced by this inspection must be planted within 30 days of receipt of notification by the current owner(s). New tree plantings may be postponed for up to six months by posting a performance security (see section 86-81). Failure to plant new trees in accordance with these provisions will constitute a violation of this article, and will subject the property owner to civil penalties as set forth in this article.

                  DIVISION 3. - ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES 

                  Sec. 86-81. - Performance security. 
                  When planting stock availability is low or weather conditions are not appropriate for planting new trees, the project owner may postpone planting for up to six months, provided that performance security is posted with Forsyth County in accordance with the following criteria: 
                  (a)  Security shall be in an approved form submitted to the department of planning and development with appropriate documentation of stock availability and weather conditions. 
                  (b)  Security shall be in an amount equal to 110 percent of the cost of materials, installation, and guarantee, as demonstrated by a signed contract between the owner and a landscape contractor and approval by department of planning and development. 
                  An inspection shall be made by the department of planning and development of all tree plantings to assure compliance with plan requirements prior to release of the performance security. Forsyth County will use the performance security at the time of expiration if the planting requirements have not been fulfilled, or if the owner has not requested an extension. Funds received from the performance security will be used to bring the project into compliance. One six-month extension is permitted with documented justification. Any inspections performed after the final inspection (for project release) are subject to re-inspection fee schedules, which shall be maintained on file at the department of planning and development. 
                  (Ord. No. 98-C, § 3.1, 2-5-2015) 
                  Sec. 86-82. - Inspection. 
                  The director may periodically inspect the project during the course thereof and shall make a final inspection following the completion of work. Applicants shall cooperate with the department of planning and development in making such inspections. The department of planning and development shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for the purpose of entering at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigating and inspecting the sites of any land-disturbing activities. 
                  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized county employee who request entry for the purpose of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  Prior to the issuance of a permit for any land-disturbing activity, the department of planning and development must inspect all tree protection devices for compliance with the tree protection and/or replacement plan. Failure to adhere to tree protection and/or replacement plan will subject the project to enforcement procedures found in this article. 
                  Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, final plat, or other forms of county acceptance, the department of planning and development shall inspect for compliance with all tree protection and replacement ordinance requirements. Any disturbances in tree save areas or deficiencies in the required site density factor will be cited at this time. Tree save area deficiencies must be corrected with new tree plantings prior to project release. 
                  Existing trees, which are not expected to survive, will not be counted toward meeting density requirements. Conversely, any existing trees not shown to remain on plans but which have been saved (meeting all tree protection standards) through field adjustments may be counted toward density requirements, provided that all changes are recorded. 
                  Once a tree save area has been established through the department of planning and development plan approval process, any destruction of trees in that area must be mitigated by planting new trees to a density factor of 60 units per acre. A revised tree protection and/or replacement plan must be submitted and approved by the department of planning and development.

                  Sec. 86-83. - Remedial care. 
                  Trees in tree save areas, which have been adversely impacted by the construction process, may be subject to remedial care. Remedial care will be performed at the discretion of the director and may include (but is not limited to) the following: 
                  • Pruning 
                  • Soil aeration 
                  • Fertilization 
                  • Supplemental watering

                  Any county issued permit may be suspended, revoked or modified by the director upon finding that the holder is in violation of the terms of the permit or any portion of this article. 
                  (a)  If it is determined that a person has engaged in land-disturbing activities and has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be posted on site. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of this article within three days after such notice of noncompliance has been issued shall result in immediate issuance of a stop work order. Where any emergency exists, as determined by the director, no written notice shall be required before a stop work order is issued. 
                  (b)  Any person violating any provision of this article, permitting condition or stop-work order shall be subject to issuance of a magistrate court citation, which may result in a fine up to $1,000.00 per violation or by imprisonment for a period not to exceed 60 days, or both. 
                  In addition to or in lieu of any civil penalty, the department of planning and development shall require the replacement of trees by the person violating this article in order to meet the minimum requirements set out herein.

                  Sec. 86-104. - Appeals of decisions of administrative officials. 
                  Appeals may be taken by any person aggrieved by any decision authorized by this ordinance, by filing with the tree protection commission a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof, within 30 days after the action appealed from was taken. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the official from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the tree preservation commission, after notice of appeal shall have been filed, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his or her opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the tree protection commission or court of record on application, on notice to the official from whom the appeal is taken, and on due cause shown. The tree protection commission shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal and shall give notice thereof as well as due notice to the parties in interest. Upon the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney. The tree protection commission shall decide the appeal within 30 days of submittal. If no decision is made within this time frame, the appeal shall be considered approved. An appeal shall be sustained upon an expressed finding by the tree protection commission that the administrative official's action was based upon an erroneous finding of a material fact, or that he or she acted in an arbitrary manner. In exercising its powers, the tree protection commission may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from and to that end shall have all the powers of the administrative official from whom the appeal was taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit provided that all requirements imposed by the applicable laws other than these are met. 
                  Any person aggrieved by a decision of the tree protection commission may appeal such decision to the Forsyth County Zoning Board of Appeals. Such person is entitled to the benefit of the powers and procedures of the appeal process outlined in the Unified Development Code, and any subsequent amendments, provided that they have been heard and aggrieved by a decision of the tree preservation commission.

                  Appendix B: Density Calculations 
                  The density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved, planting new trees, or some combination of the two as represented by the following formula: 
                  Site Density Factor (SDF) = Exiting Density Factor (EDF) + Replacement Density Factor (RDF) 
                  Site Density Factor (SDF) 
                  The SDF is calculated by multiplying the Disturbed Area by the Density Factor and adding any required Significant Tree recompense. 
                  Existing Density Factor (EDF) 
                  The EDF is calculated by converting the diameter of individual trees to Density Factor units. The Density Factor for existing trees is shown in Table A, "Trees Remaining on Site". 
                  Replacement Density Factor (RDF) 
                  The RDF is calculated by subtracting the EDF from the SDF. The Density Factor for replacement (new) trees is shown in Table B, "Proposed New Trees". 
                  Trees within Buffers 
                  Existing trees within buffers may not be counted toward the required Site Density Factor. Replacement trees planted within buffers may be counted toward the required Site Density Factor. 
                  EXAMPLE: 
                  1.  A commercial site with 7.5 acres net disturbed area and no significant trees removed would result in a site density factor of 112.5 tree units, calculated as follows: 
                  7.5 acres x 15 tree density units = 112.5 SDF 
                  2.  A total of 13 trees will remain on the 7.5-acre site. The tree count is as follows: 
                  7—12" diameter pines 
                  3—14" diameter pines 
                  3—18" diameter oaks 
                  3.  Converting diameters (DBH) to density units, the EDF is determined below (see Table A): 

                   
                  **See Article 2, Section 2.12, Significant Trees, for explanation of specimen tree credits. 
                  4.  The RDF is calculated by subtracting the EDF from the SDF. 
                  RDF = 112.5 - 91.5 = 21 
                  5.  A total of 21 replacement units are required.

                  Note: For the purpose of this chapter, tree diameters are measured at diameter breast height (DBH) or caliper is measured at ground level for trees having a four-inch caliper or less. 
                  Seven-gallon, or larger, container grown pine trees will be given a replacement credit of 0.4 units each. 
                  Tree relocation: Replacement units will be granted to trees relocated on site. Tree relocation is subject to approval of the director. 
                  B1 Criteria for Replacement Trees 
                  1.  Spacing and the potential size of species chosen shall be compatible with spatial limitations of the site. 
                  2.  The species must be ecologically compatible with the specifically intended growing site. 
                  3.  Trees must be replaced with at least 60 percent overstory species. 
                  4.  The tree must be compatible in extent of crown and root systems at maturity with nearby utilities. 
                  5.  Where trees must be added to achieve the SDF pines may not comprise more than 40 percent of the required units. Where existing pines already comprise more than 40 percent of the required units, no more pines may be credited toward the required units. This limitation applies to replacement planting only; existing pines may comprise 100 percent of the existing density factor. 
                  6.  No more than 40 percent of the replacement trees can be composed of any one genus.

                  Condition Criteria 
                  The director will determine if a tree qualifies as a specimen tree using the following criteria: 
                  A.  All specimen trees are to have a sound trunk, with less than 20 percent radial trunk dieback. 
                  B.  No more than one major and several minor dead limbs (hardwoods only). 
                  C.  No major insect or pathological problems. 
                  D.  Life expectancy of 15+ years for hardwoods, 8+ years for pines. 
                  E.  Smaller trees can be considered specimen trees if rare or of unusual quality, species or historical significance. 
                  F.  Specimen tree stands are a contiguous grouping of mature and evenly aged trees of high value. These trees may be of pure species composition, historical significance, or possess unusual aesthetic qualities. Not all the trees within the specimen tree stand have to be the size of specimen trees for the stand to qualify. 
                  Historic and Landmark Trees 
                  The Georgia Landmark and Historic Tree Register was established in 1994 by the Georgia Urban Forest Council. The register serves as a record of all the Significant Trees across the state. 
                  Landmark and historic trees are those individual trees and groups of trees that have been designated as significant on the basis of their importance in national, state or local history. They possess integrity of location, setting, design, progeny, and represent events, heritage, feeling, and association. 
                  Inclusion of a tree or group of trees on the register is used in Forsyth County for the protection and preservation of the tree(s). Any tree or group of trees in Forsyth County which is included on The Georgia Landmark and Historic Tree Register is prohibited from being damaged and shall be removed only with prior county approval. If a historic and/or landmark tree is damaged or removed without prior county approval, the department of planning and development will require replacement by trees with a total density equal to eight times the unit value of the tree removed. 
                  In order to qualify as a historic or landmark tree according to this ordinance, a tree must be included on The Georgia Landmark and Historic Tree Register prior to the issuance of the development permit being sought.

                  PREFACE 
                  Forsyth County's first land use regulations went into effect in 1973. Another Resolution became effective on December 11, 1979, that replaced the prior regulations adopted some six years earlier. The preparation of the County's Zoning and Land Use Resolution and Ordinance began in mid 1978. Over a 17-month period, the persons involved dedicated a great amount of voluntary time and effort to study and revise the draft. The goals of the revision process in 1978 and 1979 were to ensure orderly development of land use; to protect the citizens from harm arising out of disorderly development or improper construction techniques; and to make the regulations minimally restrictive, yet strong enough to achieve the goals in mind. 
                  The 1979 Resolution and Ordinance, most recently referred to as Ordinance 30J, has been amended and readopted a number of times to respond to changing conditions. As Forsyth County prepares to enter the New Millennium, a new set of zoning and subdivision regulations is needed. 
                  Toward that end, the Forsyth County Board of Commissioners, with technical assistance from the Georgia Mountains Regional Development Center and guidance from an appointed Master Land Use Committee, prepared an update to the land use element of the comprehensive plan of Forsyth County in 1997 and 1998. Among the many important goals of the land use plan are the following: 
                  (A)  Encourage development patterns that avoid the uneconomical extension of public facilities and services and are more successful at creating a sense of community; 
                  (B)  Manage growth so as to not overburden the County infrastructure nor significantly detract from quality of life; 
                  (C)  Work toward a residential buildout population of 225,000 to 275,000 people; 
                  (D)  Provide more detailed design guidance for major activity centers and commercial and industrial corridors to enhance the visual qualities of development; 
                  (E)  Provide for developments containing mixes of office, commercial and residential uses; 
                  (F)  Establish more flexible mixed-use development regulations and other flexible regulations that allow for creative site designs to accommodate site-specific conditions; 
                  (G)  Strengthen the role of land development regulations in guiding the development of the County; 
                  (H)  Protect and conserve the beauty and integrity of the County's natural features and historic resources; and 
                  (I)  Encourage alternative modes of transportation. 
                  In 1999, the Board of Commissioners of Forsyth County appointed a thirty-two-member committee to guide the process of comprehensively revising Ordinance 30J to meet the goals of the land use plan. The committee represented a wide array of interests. Forsyth County also contracted with a planning and community development consultant to help the staff of the Department of Planning and Community Development revise the existing regulations and prepare new chapters. 
                  The Unified Development Code represents a comprehensive revision of the County's zoning and subdivision regulations to address growth and development issues the County will face in the first decade of the twenty-first century. However, changes to the code will periodically be proposed and considered because of the need to respond to citizens and to the changing conditions of our County. For these reasons, persons purchasing the code from the Department of Planning and Community Development should be aware that changes will be made periodically and should verify that they have the most current edition available. 
                  Anyone considering rezoning, construction, development or any other change in land use should consult with the Department of Planning and Community Development as early as possible to be sure any plans conform to the current land use requirements. 
                  Please remember this CAUTION: the regulations may be modified from time to time and any changes will govern.

Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology, soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contracts, geologic structure, the presence of karst, and potentiometric surfaces. Significant recharge areas for Forsyth County are typified by those in the Piedmont and Blue Ridge, where rocks have little primary porosity, with most groundwater being stored in the overlying soils. The significant recharge areas are those with thicker soils. Field mapping indicates that thick soils in the Piedmont and Blue Ridge are characterized by a density of two or more geologic contacts per four square miles (source: 1976 1:500,000 Geologic Map of Georgia) and slopes lower than eight percent. These aquifer recharge areas, which contain soils with properties that support the recharging of groundwater, are mapped on the Official Zoning Map of Forsyth County and/or on the Official Overlay District Map of Forsyth County. Groundwater recharge areas represent freshwater resources for some residents of the county.

                  Street, major arterial: Unless otherwise defined by the Forsyth County Major Transportation Plan or Comprehensive Plan, a major arterial street is a street connecting two or more towns or communities, connecting two highways of equal or greater capacity, or serving as the primary access to a large land area. A major arterial may also serve a large traffic generator (e.g., an industrial area) and perform a secondary function of providing local access. 
                  Street, marginal access: A residential street parallel and adjacent to a major thoroughfare and which provides access to abutting properties with protection from through traffic. 
                  Street, private: A road or street that has not been accepted for maintenance by the county and that is not owned and maintained by the state, City of Cumming, another county, or another public entity.

                  Subdivision, minor: A subdivision of six or fewer lots which does not involve the construction of a new public or private street. Because minor subdivisions do not involve the construction of a new public or private street, they are processed administratively by the department of planning and community development as final plat applications that do not require sketch plat approval. Any improvements to an existing public street abutting the tract proposed for minor subdivision, or the installation of utilities along said existing public road, as may be required to comply with this Code, shall be done according to plans and permit requirements of this Code, but said requirements shall not subject the minor subdivision to the requirements for a major subdivision as specified in this Code. 
                  Subdivision, major: A subdivision of seven or more lots which may or may not involve the construction of a new public or private street; or any subdivision of less than seven lots that involves the construction of a new public or private street. Because major subdivisions involve construction of a new public or private street or the upgrade of an existing private way to county standards, construction plans and land disturbance permits are required, and major subdivisions are therefore processed in multiple steps including sketch plat approval (unless specifically exempted), approval of construction plans and issuance of land disturbance permits, and final plat approval. 
                  Sufficient capacity: Shall mean that the anticipated additional effluent volume per day (based upon Forsyth County Water and Sewer Department usage guidelines) does not exceed the maximum treatment volume per day as provided in the existing Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division ("EPD") permit.

Variance requests that apply to assemblages of four or more existing or proposed lots or units shall be relegated to the board of commissioners for consideration; the commissioners shall base decisions upon the same criteria as the ZBA. Variances described in section 8-6.4(a) may be approved administratively by the director without being presented to the zoning board of appeals for consideration. 
                  (c)  To hear and decide appeals made pursuant to other county ordinances granting jurisdiction to the ZBA. Unless otherwise provided for in the applicable ordinance, the ZBA's authority shall be limited to reviewing the appropriate official's interpretation, administration, or enforcement of the ordinance. The ZBA may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination of the director, official or administrative officer. The ZBA shall, however, only reverse or modify such a decision or determination after conducting a public hearing if the ZBA determines the director, official or administrative officer was clearly erroneous in his interpretation, administration or enforcement of the ordinance. It is not sufficient grounds to reverse a decision by the director or other official if the ZBA merely disagrees with the decision. If a fine is at issue, the ZBA has the authority to reduce the fine but may not increase it.

                  (a)  Each land disturbance permit (LDP) application must be approved and a LDP issued within 12 months of the initial plan submittal date. Failure to obtain a permit within 12 months will require the submittal of a new land disturbance permit application. Any associated plan review fees must be repaid with the submittal of the new LDP application. 
                  (b)  All plans and supporting documents are to be submitted to the department of planning and community development by 5:00 p.m. each Monday, provided Monday is not a holiday for which the department offices are closed in observance. In such event, the plans and supporting documents must be submitted by 5:00 p.m. the Friday before the Monday holiday. The planning and community development department will distribute the plans and supporting documents to the appropriate departments for their review. The department of planning and community development will not accept LDP permit applications without the appropriate fee being submitted with the application and without all other requirements for submittal. 
                  (c)  Nine business days after the plan submittal deadline, a plan review meeting will be held by the department of planning and community development at which one member of each reviewing department will be present to distribute comments, if necessary. The comments will be returned to the developer and/or their agent for corrections by their engineer and/or surveyor. 
                  (d)  After the departmental comments have been addressed, and corrections to the plans are made, the developer and/or their agent will return to each reviewing department to provide evidence that such changes have been made. If the changes are satisfactory to the reviewing department's discretion, then said department shall approve the application for plan approval and affix their departmental stamp indicating approval on the plans. 
                  (e)  The developer and/or their agent will deliver to the department of planning and community development, the approved plans, with the appropriate stamps affixed, as well as a completed application for plan approval.

                  (f)  The department of planning and community development will verify that the reviewing departments have signed the application for plan approval and have stamped the plans. If any department has given conditional approval, said department must list under what conditions their approval is granted. Said conditions must be in letter form on department letterhead, indicating the project and date of conditional approval, and delivered to the department of planning and community development prior to, or concurrent with, the sign-off of the plans granted conditional approval. With any conditional approval, the person so conditioning the plans must sign the letter of conditions and print their name for further clarification. 
                  (g)  After the department of planning and community development has verified that all plans and supporting documents are true and correct, the director, or his designee, will approve and sign the plans and supporting documents. Construction plans for major subdivisions must be consistent with sketch plats approved by the Forsyth County Planning Commission, and the director shall not give final approval without ensuring consistency with sketch plat approval. 
                  (h)  Land disturbance permits will be issued after approvals have been granted by the appropriate reviewing departments. The permit will be issued at a pre-construction conference with the department responsible for inspection of the site.

No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for a building or structure for which access to the building or structure is over a driveway or other way to a public street unless and until an appropriate culvert not less than 18 inches in diameter is installed under the driveway surface sufficient to maintain the integrity of the public drainage system, as required by the engineering department's stormwater design manual. In exceptional cases an exemption may be granted by the director of engineering after a field inspection. The builder or homeowner must call the director of engineering to request an exemption (curb and gutter subdivisions are exempted). 
                  7-5.14. - Building sewers. 
                  (a)  All persons installing sewer service connections for hire in Forsyth County must have a state plumber's license.

                  ARTICLE VI. - ZONING COMPLIANCE 

                  7-6.1. - Intent. 
                  The determination whether a proposed use is proper in a given zoning district shall be made by the director of the department of planning and community development. Interpretations concerning the meaning of this Code may be important in a particular case. Persons should not expend money on project development until the director has determined in writing that the proposed use is proper, as evidenced by a certificate of zoning compliance. 
                  (Amd. of 12-1-2011) 
                  7-6.2. - Certificate of zoning compliance. 
                  A certificate of zoning compliance shall be issued in a form to be determined by the department as evidence that a proposed use complies with this Code. A certificate of zoning compliance may be issued upon written request by the owner of the property in question or his/her authorized agent, even though such request is outside the process of applying for a building permit or certificate of occupancy; provided, however, that such requests for certificate of zoning compliance shall be produced by the department of planning and community development only upon the payment of a certificate fee, if required, and according to a schedule implemented by the director. 
                  (Amd. of 12-1-2011) 
                  7-6.3. - Reliance. 
                  Until a certificate of zoning compliance is obtained with regard to a particular project, a person expending money in any way on project planning or development does so at his own risk. No person shall be deemed to have expended funds in reliance on zoning provisions unless and until a certificate of zoning compliance is obtained. 
                  ARTICLE VII. - FEES GENERALLY 

                  7-7.1. - Purpose.

                  ARTICLE VIII. - FEE AMOUNTS 

                  7-8.1. - Generally. 
                  Fees charged for building permits and subdivision approval shall relate to the complexity of the project involved and the consequent increased burden of regulation and enforcement within the county. Fee amounts will be determined and set by the board of commissioners periodically. For any conditional use under this Code, for variances to the requirements herein, or for special application requirements specified by this Code, applicants shall submit any additional amounts as deemed sufficient and appropriate by the county in order to obtain any needed technical expertise so as to assist county staff in evaluating the request. 
                  7-8.2. - Building permits.

                  (b)  If the building inspection department fails the inspection because of defects noted at the time of an inspection, a trade violation fee in the amount of $25.00 shall be charged for the first inspection and shall increase in increments of $25.00 for each subsequent failed inspection for the same code violations. The chief building inspector shall have the authority to place the project under stop work after the third failed inspection of the same violations and have the contractor or subcontractor pay all accrued trade violation fees due to date. 
                  (c)  Building construction plans shall be reviewed under the same fee schedule as the Forsyth County Fire Department. Fees shall be paid at the time plans are submitted for review and major revisions to plans shall be charged the same as a new plan submittal. 
                  (d)  Any and all fees shall be paid by the person to whom the permit is issued prior to such issuance. Any additional fees incurred subsequent to permit issuance shall be paid prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy. All fees shall be paid to the department of planning and community development. Should any work be performed for which a permit is required under this Code prior to this issuance of such permit, then and in that event the fees as set forth herein or pursuant to this Code shall be doubled. Should a formal written notification from the director, building official, or other official be forwarded prior to obtaining a permit, an additional penalty of $25.00 shall be paid at the time of application to cover administrative costs.

                  Footnotes: 
                  --- (9) --- 
                  Editor's note— An amendment dated November 1, 2007, amended Chapter 8 to read as herein set out. Formerly, Chapter 8 pertained to amendments and applications and derived from Amd. of 3-26-2001; Amd. of 5-12-2003; Amd. of 9-25-2003; Amd. of 2-2-2004; Amd. of 5-17-2004; Amd. of 11-15-2004; Amd. of 12-20-2004. 

                  ARTICLE I. - APPLICATION OF REGULATIONS 
                  This chapter establishes the authority to amend this Code, including the zoning map, and establishes the appropriate procedures to do so. It specifies the application requirements and process for the following types of applications: Amendments to the official text of this Code, amendments to the official zoning map/rezonings (hereafter only referred to as rezonings), conditional use permits (CUPs), home occupations, sketch plats, variances, appeals of administrative decisions, appeals of zoning board of appeals decisions, and zoning condition amendments. 
                  (Amd. of 11-1-2007; Amd. of 4-5-2012) 
                  ARTICLE II. - APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS 
                  The following requirements shall be submitted for all applications, unless otherwise specified in the text of this chapter. Additional requirements that vary per application type are delineated in articles IV through X of this chapter. County initiated applications are exempt from these requirements, but shall otherwise follow all requirements of the Georgia Zoning Procedures Act. A summary of application requirements can be found in Table 8.1. An optional pre-application meeting may be requested by the applicant to discuss the general aspects of the proposal, the process, and information that will be required from the applicant in order to submit a complete application. Preliminary discussions are not binding on either the applicant or the county. This is often the first opportunity to review submittal requirements and procedures and is intended to assist in filing complete applications. 
                  (Amd. of 11-1-2007; Amd. of 4-5-2012) 

                  8-2.1. - Requirements for all applications. 
                  All applications specified in this chapter shall be submitted on forms provided by the county and shall be submitted with the documentation required for each type of application. The director is hereby authorized to establish administrative deadlines for the receipt of applications and associated information in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
                  (a)  Form. All applications shall be submitted using the appropriate application form per each application type, as specified by the department. 
                  (1)  Review of application completeness. Upon submittal, each application shall be subjected to a review of application completeness prior to being officially accepted by the county. An application shall be considered "complete" if it is submitted on the required form, includes all submittal information, including all exhibits specified by the director, and accompanied by the application processing fee as adopted by the board of commissioners and as may be revised periodically. The review of application completeness shall be conducted by county staff within five business days of the submittal deadline. If the county determines the application is complete, the application shall be processed pursuant to this chapter. If the county determines that the application is incomplete, county staff shall notify the applicant of that fact via the contact information provided and specify the ways in which the application is deficient. All incomplete applications shall receive no further processing until the deficiencies are corrected via a new submittal. Resubmittal of the application shall be treated as a new application. Under no circumstances may county staff delay conducting the review of application completeness in excess of five business days of the submittal deadline. If the review of application completeness is not completed within five business days of the submittal deadline, the application shall be determined complete. 
                  (b)  Submittal fees. All applications shall be submitted with the required fee. The amount of each fee will be established by the director, and approved by the board of commissioners, which may be revised periodically. Applicants may apply for more than one application simultaneously and such applications may be simultaneously considered by the county as more specifically provided by this chapter. In the case that more than one application is filed simultaneously, the applicant shall be responsible for filing the appropriate information and paying the specified fees for each application filed. All fees are nonrefundable once the application has been determined complete. 
                  (c)  Boundary survey. All applications shall be accompanied by ten copies of a boundary survey prepared by a registered land surveyor, and one copy of the boundary survey shall be reduced to a size of 8.5 inches by 11 inches. 
                  (d)  Legal description. All applications shall be accompanied by a written metes and bounds legal description. It must establish a point of beginning and from the point of beginning give each dimension bounding the property, calling the directions (e.g. north, northeasterly, southerly, etc.) which the boundary follows around the property returning to the point of beginning. If there are multiple properties, all properties shall be combined into one legal description. 
                  (e)  Site plan minimum requirements. All applications shall be accompanied by ten copies of a site plan and one copy of the site plan reduced to a size of 8.5 inches by 11 inches. For applications for properties greater than ten acres, the required site plan shall be prepared in full compliance with this subsection by a land surveyor, professional engineer, landscape architect or architect licensed to practice in the state of Georgia and shall be stamped and sealed by such stated professional in accord with Georgia law. The site plan so prepared may contain a disclaimer, as allowed by industry practice or applicable licensure requirements that the site plan is not to be considered an engineered document. For applications regarding properties of ten acres or less, the site plan shall comply with the minimum information contents described in this subsection, but need not be prepared by a licensed professional as noted above. If details submitted on a site plan do not meet numerical requirements as identified in this Code, a specific variance request shall be included on the submitted application. Unless otherwise specified in the board approval, the site plan submitted as part of the application shall be considered binding on the applicant. Site plans submitted under the requirements of this chapter are not engineered, and as such the term "binding" does not imply that it is site plan specific; rather it implies that the locations and/or uses are what the applicant intends to implement on the subject property. In any instance where the site plan conflicts with this Code, or any other county regulation, and there is not an approved variance, the regulation shall take precedent. The boundary of the site plan shall match the boundaries of the submitted boundary survey and the legal description. The site plan shall at minimum contain the following information (as applicable): 
                  (1)  Proposed layout of streets, alleys, lots, and pedestrian circulation systems; 
                  (2)  Lot or tract dimensions with required setbacks shown; 
                  (3)  Required and proposed buffers; 
                  (4)  Required and proposed, landscape areas, common areas, and open space; 
                  (5)  Proposed structures with square footages (except for single family residential subdivisions); 
                  (6)  Proposed uses for each structure (e.g. retail sales, offices, townhouses, etc.); 
                  (7)  Existing and proposed zoning districts of the subject property and abutting property; 
                  (8)  Proposed and existing location and use of all structures on the subject property; 
                  (9)  Existing and proposed right-of-way locations and dimensions and names of all roads and streets bounding the subject property; 
                  (10)  Driveways and parking areas with number of provided parking spaces; 
                  (11)  Loading and unloading facilities; 
                  (12)  Preliminary and existing locations of storm drainage and structures; 
                  (13)  Preliminary and existing locations and point of access for major utility lines (e.g. water, gas, electric, etc.); 
                  (14)  Preliminary and existing wastewater facilities including areas reserved for drain fields and septic tanks or point of access, sewer easements and manholes; 
                  (15)  Tax map/parcel number and owner name of subject property and all abutting property owners as shown on current county tax map records; 
                  (16)  Existing tree canopy (general location of existing canopy as indicated on the county GIS aerial photography); and 
                  (17)  Preliminary locations of environmental conditions (e.g. streams, wetlands, watershed protection districts, flood hazard areas, river corridor boundaries, groundwater recharge areas, etc.). 
                  (f)  Confirmation of paid taxes. A copy of the paid tax receipt for subject property or a statement by an official in the tax commissioner's office or other official document issued by the tax commissioner's office indicating taxes have been paid for the last year that they were due. 
                  (g)  Additional application requirements. Articles IV through IX of this chapter identify additional application requirements per each type of application. 
                  (h)  Corporate/company disclosures. All applications shall identify the name of the applicant and, if the applicant is different from the property owner, be accompanied by a duly executed owner authorization. If either the applicant or owner are corporations or limited liability companies, the application shall contain the names of the corporate stockholders with ten percent ownership or greater, officers, and directors, unless the corporation has stock that is traded on a national stock exchange in which case the corporate name shall be sufficient. A limited liability company shall identify the name of all officers or members. In addition to the owner and applicant, the application shall further identify any parties having a direct financial interest in the zoning application other than the owner and applicant (for instance, the intended developer or anticipated commercial occupant if known). If such additional parties having a direct financial interest are corporations or companies, then the names of corporate stockholders with ten percent ownership or greater, officers, directors and company members shall be provided unless the corporation has stock that is traded on a national stock exchange in which case the corporate name shall be sufficient. In the event that public disclosure of the developer or commercial occupant may cause such developer or occupant to withdraw from pursuing a project due to competition, trade secret, or proprietary business concerns, then an affidavit affirmatively declaring such shall be tendered with the application and in that event only the owner and/or authorized applicant shall be identified. 
                  (Amd. of 11-1-2007; Amd. of 4-5-2012; Amd. of 5-2-2013; Amd. of 2-6-2014; Amd. of 12-3-2015; Amd. of 4-13-2017(1)) 
                  8-2.2. - Withdrawal of applications. 
                  Applications as specified in this chapter may be withdrawn in conformance with the following provisions or as specified in this Code: 
                  (a)  Applicant withdrawal. All applications may be withdrawn upon the written request of the applicant. Withdrawal requests received prior to the date that public notice is provided in a newspaper of general circulation may be withdrawn without prejudice, and shall be permitted to be withdrawn without prejudice. Once public notice is provided in the newspaper of general circulation, the application shall be withdrawn with prejudice. However, the applicant may withhold the written request for withdrawal until the public hearing, in which the board with jurisdiction may permit applications to be withdrawn at the public hearing, but the withdrawal shall be with prejudice unless extenuating circumstances are evident and the board grants approval to withdraw without prejudice. There shall be no requirement that the pertinent board make specific findings of extenuating circumstances in order to allow withdrawal without prejudice. In no event shall an application be withdrawn more than once without prejudicing the right of the applicant to apply again within 12 months from the date the application was made. 
                  (b)  Administrative withdrawal. In order to remove applications that have been pending for more than 180 days after the application enters applicant work time without being placed on a public hearing agenda, the director is hereby authorized to administratively withdraw said applications. For purposes of this section, "being placed on a public hearing agenda" shall be deemed to occur on the date on which the department deems an application complete for board consideration. Documentation shall be kept on file indicating the department's attempts to contact the applicant via the contact information provided. All administratively withdrawn applications shall be considered withdrawn with prejudice. 
                  (Amd. of 11-1-2007; Amd. of 9-7-2017(1)) 
                  8-2.3. - Reconsideration of applications. 
                  If an application is withdrawn with prejudice or denied by the zoning board of appeals or board of commissioners, then the same property with a substantially similar application may not be submitted for reconsideration until the expiration of at least 12 months immediately following the withdrawal at the planning commission public hearing or defeat of the application by the zoning board of appeals or board of commissioners at their public hearing, as the case may be. 
                  (Amd. of 11-1-2007) 
                  8-2.4. - Copies of policies and procedures, etc. 
                  Copies of this chapter, and any rules of procedure adopted by the planning commission, zoning board of appeals, or board of commissioners, shall be available for distribution to the general public by the department during regular business hours. 
                  (Amd. of 11-1-2007)

                  All applications as specified in this chapter shall require a public hearing prior to action on said application. 
                  (Amd. of 11-1-2007) 
                  8-3.2. - Who holds hearings. 
                  The planning commission, zoning board of appeals, or board of commissioners shall hold a public hearing on all applications. The public hearing shall constitute the public hearing that is required by the State Zoning Procedures Law (Title 36 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, sections 36-66-1 et seq.). All public hearings shall be heard in accordance with the annual schedule prepared for and adopted by each individual board, and as may be amended periodically. Public hearings shall be heard by: 
                  (a)  Planning commission. The planning commission is hereby designated as the board that shall hold a public hearing on applications to amend the text of this Code, rezoning applications, conditional use permits, and home occupations. The planning commission shall also hold the public hearing on all variance requests that were filed and scheduled to be considered simultaneously and pertaining to the same property with a rezoning, conditional use permit, or home occupation application. Recommendations on approval or denial of variances shall be made in accordance with the provisions set forth in article VI of this chapter. 
                  (b)  Zoning board of appeals. The zoning board of appeals is hereby designated as the board that shall hold a public hearing on all appeals of administrative decisions and all variances; with the exception of variance requests that are approved administratively pursuant to 8-6.4(a); variance requests that would simultaneously apply to four or more existing or proposed lots or units within a single subdivision; or for variance requests that were filed and scheduled to be considered simultaneously and pertaining to the same property with another application in which the authority to hold the public hearing rests with either the planning commission or board of commissioners. 
                  (c)  Board of commissioners. The board of commissioners is hereby designated as the board that shall hold the second public hearing on all amendments to the text of this Code. The board of commissioners shall also hold public hearings on all sketch plat applications and all variance applications that would simultaneously apply to four or more existing or proposed lots or units within a single subdivision that are not being simultaneously considered with a rezoning, or conditional use permit application. The board of commissioners shall also hold the public hearing for appeals of zoning board of appeals decisions and zoning condition amendments. Delegation of public hearings to the planning commission or zoning board of appeals in no way abrogates the right of the board of commissioners to initiate and conduct, at its discretion, a public hearing for any application. 
                  (Amd. of 11-1-2007; Amd. of 4-3-2008; Amd. of 4-5-2012; Amd. of 7-18-2013)

                  (3)  Where the land owned by the applicant does not border upon a public road in order that a passersby may see the sign which provides the public notice, the required sign shall be placed on the right-of-way of a public road nearest the property in question as well as upon the subject property. 
                  (4)  Acts of vandalism or natural occurrences which may diminish the effectiveness of the public notice provided shall not void any proceedings or actions taken by any of the three boards or the director. 
                  (5)  Once the zoning board of appeals or board of commissioners has made a final motion upon any application requiring a public hearing, the applicant shall be responsible for the removal of all public hearing signs. Failure to do so will result in a fine of $100.00 per day until the sign(s) are removed. Calculation of the fine shall begin three days after the motion to act on the application or the date the application is withdrawn. 
                  (d)  Additional information. The director may request additional information regarding public notice if said information is deemed necessary to help the public understand the application request. 
                  (Amd. of 11-1-2007; Amd. of 4-5-2012; Amd. of 9-7-2017(1)) 
                  8-3.4. - Conduct of public hearings and procedures for considering applications. 
                  The following procedures shall govern public hearings held for purposes of considering applications as specified in this chapter: 
                  (a)  Presiding officer. The public hearing shall be conducted by the presiding officer. The presiding officer shall be the chairman, or in the chairman's absence, a designated member of the body hearing the request according to each board's rules and procedures. 
                  (b)  Requirements for speakers. Persons wishing to speak in support (including applicant and designated spokesperson) or opposition to any application shall provide their name and address on the specified form to county staff prior to speaking at the public hearing. In addition, each person shall be required to disclose any campaign contributions/gifts equal to or greater than $100.00 given to any Forsyth County elected official within two years of the public hearing date. 
                  (c)  Time limits. Speakers at the public hearing shall be allowed up to ten minutes per side, provided, however, that the presiding officer may at his or her discretion elect to extend this time period equally to proponents and opponents. The presiding officer may also, at his or her discretion, permit presentations by other persons and allow the same to exceed the allotted times. 
                  (d)  Actions made in public. Any recommendation, finding, decision, or other action taken by the planning commission, zoning board of appeals, or board of commissioners will be made in public, at the time of the public hearing or at the time said application is continued or deferred for future consideration at a regular meeting of the respective body; provided, however, that an application may be tabled only by the board of commissioners. 
                  (e)  Effect of board decisions. All findings, or other action of the planning commission regarding applications for rezoning and conditional use permits, shall be in the form of recommendations to the board of commissioners. The findings and decision of the zoning board of appeals shall be final unless a person aggrieved shall, within ten days of such decision, petition the Board of Commissioners of Forsyth County to review the decision. All decisions by the board of commissioners shall be final, although an appeal of a board decision may be made in conformance with article XI of this chapter. 
                  (f)  Any property owner or developer, as is applicable, that is granted a rezoning, zoning condition amendment, or conditional use permit under this Code shall have 18 months to commence development based upon the provisions of this Code that existed at the time the rezoning application, zoning condition amendment application, or conditional use permit application was accepted by the county. For purposes of this paragraph, the phrase "commence development" shall mean the application for and issuance of a land disturbance permit for a development that is authorized by the granted rezoning, zoning condition amendment, or conditional use permit. It is not the intention of this paragraph that the receipt of a permit unaccompanied by completion of the work authorized by the permit shall result in an entitlement to avoid future amendments to this Code. It is, rather, the intention of this Code that the application for and issuance of a land disturbance permit is part of a continuous and ongoing land development process. Expiration of the issued land disturbance permit anticipated in this paragraph, with the permitted work not having been completed, shall result in the property owner or developer, as is applicable, having to comply with that version of the Code that exists at the time of tendering any subsequent land disturbance permit application.

                  8-4.5. - Director's responsibilities. 
                  The director shall conduct a continued study of the needs of the county and shall, from time to time, prepare such modifications, revisions, or amendments to this Code, including the official zoning map and any adopted overlay district maps, as may be necessary to conform to the comprehensive plan, land use studies, major transportation plans, and other documents. The modifications, revisions, or amendments shall include such text providing definitions, specifications, and conditions as may be appropriate to the matter considered, as well as maps delineating any geographical changes.

                  8-5.3. - When required. 
                  All rezoning, conditional use permit, and sketch plat applications shall be required in accordance with the following specifications: 
                  (a)  Rezonings. Applications for rezonings shall be required when proposed land use or land development is not in conformance with the existing zoning district. 
                  (1)  Rezonings not permitted. No rezoning shall be made nor accepted by the department involving a request to rezone to the following zoning districts: 
                  a.  R1R

                  (i)  A1—Agricultural district 
                  (ii)  Ag-Res—Agricultural residential district 
                  b.  Residential zoning districts: 
                  (i)  Res1—Single family residential district 
                  (ii)  Res2—Single family residential district 
                  (iii)  Res3—Single family residential district

                  e.  Master planned districts: 
                  (i)  MPD—Master planned district 
                  (b)  Conditional use permits. Applications for conditional use permits shall be required as specified in the uses permitted tables in this Code. 
                  (c)  Home occupations. Applications for home occupations shall be required in accordance with chapter 8, article X, and chapter 16, article III of this Code. 
                  (d)  Sketch plats. Applications for sketch plats afford the director and the board of commissioners an opportunity, prior to construction or build-out of a proposed development, to review a detailed site plan ("sketch plat") of the proposed subdivision or land development in order to ensure development compliance with the Unified Development Code and all other county ordinances and regulations. The sketch plat process is also an opportunity to allow public participation with respect to those developments for which a sketch plat is required. All major subdivisions and any other land development requiring a permit for land disturbance that involves either a tract of land five acres or more, or an area of disturbance five acres or more, shall require the submission of a sketch plat to the director. However, it is not the intent of this Code to require an applicant who already has a site plan that was approved as part of a rezoning or conditional use application, to go through a public review process a second time for the same or substantially the same development. Accordingly, a sketch plat shall not be required for major subdivisions or said land development when the development proposal found by the director is substantially in accordance with the site plan on file in the department. If a proposed sketch plat does not substantially conform to the site plan on file, or if there is no development plan on file for the subject property, then a sketch plat approval shall be required. Prior to the issuance of any permit for land disturbance, the board of commissioners shall hold a public hearing and must approve the sketch plat if required. 
                  (1)  Amendments to approved site plans/sketch plats. The director is authorized to approve minor amendments to site plans/sketch plats. Minor amendments shall include, but are not limited to, adjusting residential lot lines, modifying the layout of internal roads to a subdivision, or relocating open space. Any proposed amendment to a sketch plat that is determined by the director to constitute a public interest, that decreases the amount of open space by ten percent or more, or that increases the density by ten percent or more shall be deemed a major amendment. The relocation of an active amenities area from the interior to the exterior of the property or to a different location on the exterior of the property, reduction in minimum lot size, and change of proposed use shall constitute a major amendment. For all amendments to sketch plats determined to be major amendments, the board of commissioners shall be required to hold a public hearing, but such hearing shall be limited specifically to testimony regarding whether the proposed amendment should or should not be approved. The board of commissioners shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny the proposed major amendment to a sketch plat. Procedures for considering a major amendment to a sketch plat shall be the same as required for an initial application for sketch plat approval.

                  All rezonings, conditional use permits, and sketch plats, not including county initiated applications, shall comply with the following procedures as set forth in this article: 
                  (a)  Application for zoning review. All rezoning, conditional use permit, and sketch plat applications require an application for zoning review in conformance with the application requirements as set forth in section 8-5.4 of this article. Each application will be subject to a review of application completeness as specified in section 8-2.1(a)(1). Upon acceptance of the application, the department shall schedule a zoning review meeting for each application and forward all submittal information to other county staff for review and recommendations. The department will not accept revised or additional submittal materials unless requested by staff. 
                  (b)  Zoning review meeting. County staff will be available to discuss the rezoning, conditional use permit, and sketch plat application and will provide a staff review to inform the applicant of additional necessary requirements as well as to provide a recommendation about the proposed project. If the date, time, and location of the required public participation meeting were not submitted with the public participation plan, they shall be submitted at the zoning review meeting. 
                  (1)  Staff review and recommendation. At the zoning review meeting, county staff will provide the applicant with a written document specifying the following: 
                  a.  Applicability of county policies, plans, and requirements as they apply to the proposed development; 
                  b.  Appropriateness of the development with respect to the policies set forth in the Comprehensive Plan and the regulations in this chapter; 
                  c.  Scope of public participation, including minimum contact requirements; 
                  d.  Any site plan considerations or requirements; 
                  e.  Any concerns or requirements related to the anticipated impact upon public rights-of-way and public improvements and appropriate requirements to mitigate those impacts; 
                  f.  Any concerns related to land use and overall project design; 
                  g.  Possible alternatives or modifications related to proposed application; and 
                  h.  Procedures that will need to be completed prior to the application moving forward for board consideration. 
                  (2)  After the zoning review meeting, the same written document will be available to the applicant and the public and will also be disseminated to the planning commission and the board of commissioners. 
                  (3)  The staff recommendations are intended to serve as a guide and to advise the applicant prior to the application moving forward for board consideration of any issues that will or may subsequently be presented to the planning commission and board of commissioners. The information presented by county staff is intended to be used by the applicant during the applicant work time to ensure the applicant is aware of all issues prior to a public hearing. 
                  (c)  Applicant work time. Applicants who have received the staff review and recommendation have a minimum of ten days and a maximum of 180 days to submit application materials for rezonings, conditional use permits or sketch plats for board consideration including the finalization of any site plan details, full implementation of the required public participation plan and determination of all applicant proposed conditions. Finalization requires the submission of a complete and revised application prior to the expiration of the 180-day period established in section 8-2.2(b). The director may grant an extension because the application has not finalized the mandated development of regional impact (DRI) review or is being delayed because of some other county, state or federal requirements. 
                  (1)  Duration. The 180-day time frame automatically starts on the day after the zoning review meeting and can end in one of the following six actions: 
                  a.  Revised application materials are submitted prior to the expiration of the 180-day period; 
                  b.  Applicant withdraws application without prejudice; 
                  c.  Applicant initiates or is required to resubmit for an additional zoning review meeting; 
                  d.  Applicant initiates or is required to submit a new rezoning application due to a major application change(s); 
                  e.  Applicant does not meet the specified requirements within the 180 days and the director administratively processes the application as withdrawn in accordance with section 8-2.2(b); or 
                  f.  Director grants an extension because the application has not finalized the mandated development of regional impact (DRI) review, or is being delayed because of some other county, state, or federal requirements. 
                  (2)  Implementation of public participation plan. The applicant shall implement the public participation plan only during the applicant work time. 
                  a.  Public participation letter. The applicant shall obtain a list of persons and subdivisions from the department at the zoning review meeting. Each person on the provided list shall be sent the public participation letter postmarked no earlier than the date of the zoning review meeting. In addition, the applicant must ascertain if a homeowner's association exists for each listed subdivision, and if such associations have readily available contact information, according to instructions given to the applicant by the department at the zoning review meeting. County staff will notify members on the official interested parties list as well as affected political jurisdictions and public agencies. At a minimum, the applicant will provide a public participation letter in accordance with department procedures as outlined above, which is intended to encompass the following contacts: 
                  (i)  Adjacent or nearby residents or property owners within 500 feet of any part of the subject property; 
                  (ii)  Adjacent or nearby homeowner associations (HOAs) associated with identified subdivisions, if such associations have readily available contact information, within 500 feet of any part of the subject property. 
                  b.  Public participation sign. The applicant shall obtain the public participation sign from the department at the zoning review meeting. 
                  (i)  Content. At a minimum, the sign shall include: 
                  (a)  Application number; 
                  (b)  Applicant name; 
                  (c)  Contact information; 
                  (d)  Proposed change in zoning and/or request for conditional use(s); 
                  (e)  Meeting date, time and location for the applicant sponsored public participation meeting. 
                  (ii)  Posting requirements. The sign shall be posted on the subject property at least ten days prior to the date of the public participation meeting. A public participation sign shall be placed on the subject property along where said property abuts every public right-of-way. If the subject property does not abut a public right-of-way, then placement of the sign shall be in accordance with section 8-3.3(c). A signed affidavit with a dated photo of the sign placing said sign against a verifiable property landmark shall be submitted to the department within two business days after the zoning review meeting. Failure to submit the affidavit shall result in the public participation report being incomplete and the application shall not move forward for board consideration until all posting requirements are met. 
                  c.  Public participation meeting. A public participation meeting shall be held in a location relatively near the subject property and shall be held no earlier than ten days after the zoning review meeting and only during the applicant work time. The meeting shall be announced by the public participation letter and the public participation sign. 
                  (d)  Major application change. During the applicant work time, the county acknowledges that there may be various site plan and application changes that result from county staff comments, implementation of the public participation plan or through discussions with the various stakeholders. However, the department also has the responsibility to ensure that an application under review for board consideration, including a site plan, is submitted in conformance with chapter 8, articles II, III and article V of this Code. As such, this section defines the following situations as major application changes that shall require a revised application for zoning review and subsequent public participation meeting or a new application depending on the extent and nature of the proposed change(s). 
                  (1)  Any change in proposed zoning classification, which results in a more intense land use; 
                  (2)  Any change in method of sewage treatment; 
                  (3)  Any change in use or housing type; 
                  (4)  Any change in the boundary of the subject property (not including minor surveying inconsistencies); 
                  (5)  Adding variances or conditional uses; 
                  (6)  Ten percent or greater increase in the number of lots; 
                  (7)  Ten percent or greater increase in the density; 
                  (8)  Ten percent or greater decrease in the amount of open space; or 
                  (9)  As specified by the director. 
                  (e)  Board consideration. All applications determined complete by the department that are ready to be placed on a public hearing agenda shall be subject to the following restrictions: 
                  (1)  Applicant changes. Once an application is determined complete by the department for board consideration, any changes to the application, including changes to the site plan or any other element of the application submittal, shall require that the application be remanded back to the zoning review meeting stage of the application process described in subsection (b) above and then proceed with the subsequent procedural steps accordingly. 
                  (2)  Public hearing sign. The applicant shall be required to replace the public participation sign(s) with the public hearing sign(s) on the subject property in accordance with section 8-3.3(c). The applicant shall be required to obtain the sign from the department and place the sign on the subject property in a timeframe as specified in department procedures. 
                  (3)  Scheduling of public hearing. The department shall both advertise and schedule the application for a public hearing in accordance to the provisions in article III of this chapter. 
                  (4)  Staff report. County staff shall review each application in its entirety, finalize a staff report, and submit all necessary information to the planning commission and board of commissioners with sufficient time for board review prior to the public hearing. The staff report will be based upon the general considerations set forth in section 8-5.5(f)(2)a. and the special considerations set forth in section 8-5.5(f)(2)b. 
                  (f)  Public hearing. All rezoning, conditional use permit, and sketch plat applications shall receive a public hearing in accordance with the provisions as set forth in article III of this chapter. In addition, all home occupation permit applications that are required to go before the planning commission shall also receive a public hearing in accordance with article III of this chapter. 
                  (1)  Planning commission recommendation. The planning commission shall receive and review a complete submittal from the department which includes a completed application, site plan, and all applicant proposed zoning conditions. The planning commission shall also receive from the department and review a completed staff report including an analysis, a recommendation, staff recommended zoning conditions as well as review and recommendation of all applicant recommended conditions. Therefore, the planning commission shall have all the information necessary to make a recommendation to the board of commissioners on all applications for rezonings, and conditional use permits. The planning commission's recommendation to the board of commissioners shall be in the form of a motion for approval, approval with conditions or denial. Further, the planning commission may, in acting on said application, recommend a reduction of the land area for which the application is made, recommend a change in the proposed zoning district to a district that is no more intense than the one requested by the applicant, or recommend the addition or deletion of conditions or specifications of the application. The planning commission shall strive to make a recommendation on the application following the closure of the public hearing; however, the planning commission shall have until the next scheduled planning commission regular meeting from the date of the public hearing to provide its recommendation to the board of commissioners. If the planning commission does not provide a recommendation on rezoning, and conditional use permit applications within this time frame from the date of the public hearing, or within a maximum of 100 days from the date of the public participation report submittal, whichever comes first, the department shall automatically schedule the application for consideration by the board of commissioners without the benefit of a recommendation from the planning commission. 
                  (2)  Board of commissioners action on rezonings and conditional use permits. All applications for rezoning and conditional use permits shall be scheduled for consideration by the board of commissioners upon the completion of the public hearing and recommendation by the planning commission or upon expiration of the time period allowed for the planning commission to provide a recommendation or if there is no planning commission recommendation rendered within the maximum of 100 days from the public participation report submittal, whichever comes first. Before taking action on said applications, the board of commissioners shall consider the planning commission's recommendation, if any, the staff report and any application materials forwarded by the department to the board. In addition, the board of commissioners may at its discretion recognize the applicant and consider information submitted by the applicant at the time the board is considering the application. However, if the board permits the applicant to provide testimony or to submit additional materials after the public hearing by the planning commission, in fairness to the public the board of commissioners should open the floor to comments or questions from the general public on the applicant's testimony or additional materials provided in support of the application. The board of commissioners may return the application to the planning commission or the department, or both, for further study or it may approve the application. In addition, the board may approve the application with conditions or it may deny the application. Further, the board may, in acting on said application, reduce the land area for which the application is made, change the zoning district to a district that is no more intense than the one requested by the applicant, add or delete conditions or specifications of the application, or allow the application to be withdrawn with or without prejudice. Notwithstanding section 8-5.5(e)(1), and for residential zonings only, in the event the applicant requests that the board approve a zoning district that is less intense than the one requested by the application, the applicant shall be required to provide written notification of same to at least the same individuals and entities that were previously notified in accord with section 8-5.5(c)(2)(a) and public participation attendees who provide legible addresses on the sign-in sheet. Such written notice must be provided at least 15 days prior to the application being considered by the board for final action with evidence of such notification provided to the department. 
                  a.  General considerations for decision. The following items shall be considered for rezoning, and conditional use permit applications: 
                  (i)  Requirements of this Code as they pertain to the level of detail included within the conceptual plan, the purpose of which is to give surrounding property owners notice of the use to which property would be put or zoning district requested, shall be strictly complied with; 
                  (ii)  The fact that there is already ample land in the requested classification shall not of itself justify denial or approval of an application for a change in zoning classification; 
                  (iii)  The mere fact that a certain zoning classification is in effect at the time property is acquired does not preclude the new owner from seeking a new classification; 
                  (iv)  No threat to the safety or morality of the citizens of the county shall be found to exist from a commercial development of land alone; 
                  (v)  The disposition of every rezoning shall be made on the facts applicable to that particular case, considering the merits of the land in question, the impact of a decision upon the landowner's property rights, and the legitimate interests of the community. 
                  b.  Special considerations for decision. As appropriate, the following items shall be considered for rezoning, and conditional use permit applications:

                  (c)  Whether or not the applicant's proposal will have an adverse affect on the usability of adjacent or nearby property; 
                  (d)  Whether or not the applicant's proposal would result in a use that would cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities, or schools; 
                  (e)  Whether or not there are existing and changing conditions affecting the use and development of the property which give supporting grounds for approving the applicant's proposal. 
                  (iii)  Existing uses and zoning of nearby property: 
                  (a)  Use and classifications of other property; 
                  (b)  Effect upon residents of adjoining property.

                  (ix)  The planning commission may recommend changes and the board of commissioners may make changes as they deem appropriate to any submission. 
                  (3)  Board of commissioner action on sketch plats. All sketch plat applications shall be scheduled for public hearing in front of the board of commissioners and consideration will be without the benefit of a planning commission recommendation. 
                  a.  General considerations for decision. The following criteria shall be utilized by the board of commissioners in determining whether a submitted sketch plat is acceptable: 
                  (i)  Whether the proposed development is in compliance with all pertinent sections of the Unified Development Code, including but not limited to densities, height restrictions, lot size, set backs, buffers, roadway access, overlay districts, uses, streets and open spaces; 
                  (ii)  Whether the proposed development is in compliance with all other Forsyth County ordinances, codes and regulations, including but not limited to the tree preservation ordinance (81), soil erosion and sedimentation ordinance (73), storm water management ordinance (75), flood damage prevention ordinance (55) and the public sewer system ordinance (6); 
                  (iii)  Whether provision has been made for a water supply system that is compliant with pertinent county ordinances and regulations and is otherwise sufficient in terms of quantity, dependability and quality to provide an appropriate supply of water for the type of development proposed; 
                  (iv)  If a public sewage system is proposed, whether adequate provision has been made for such a system under pertinent county ordinances and regulations and, if other methods of sewage disposal are proposed including septic, that such systems comply with all pertinent federal, state and local laws and regulations; 
                  (v)  If the tendered sketch plat reveals areas deemed by the director to be unsuitable for development due to the likelihood of flooding or improper drainage or due to rock formations, topography, utility easements or other characteristics rendering the proposed development harmful to the safety, health and general welfare of the citizens of the county, whether the proposed development makes accommodations for such characteristics such that the health, safety and welfare of the county is not unduly impacted; 
                  (vi)  Whether proposed roads provide safe, convenient and functional system for vehicular, pedestrian and bicycle circulation and are otherwise consistent with the comprehensive plan and master transportation plan. 
                  (g)  Board of commissioner decision. Board of commissioner approval of a rezoning application shall be in the form of a resolution. Approvals of conditional use permit, and sketch plat applications shall be documented in a letter sent out by the department. Granting approval does not ensure the availability of utilities or other infrastructure in connection with development of the site. 
                  (h)  Application for land disturbance permit or building permit. Rezoning, conditional use permit and sketch plat applications approved by the board of commissioners are eligible to continue with the development process by applying for the appropriate land disturbance permit or building permit provided that all subsequent submittals are in conformance with the approved board of commissioner's decision and all requirements identified in this Code as well as other county, state and federal requirements, as applicable. 
                  (i)  County initiated zoning when no land disturbance permit application. Any approved rezoning of property, to include approval of a conditional use permit, where there has been no application for land disturbance permit submitted within eighteen months from the date of zoning approval shall result in a notice being delivered to the owner and the zoning applicant, if different, advising that a county-initiated rezoning to a constitutional zoning designation for the subject property may occur if no land disturbance permit application is tendered within thirty days of said notice. Upon no land disturbance permit application being tendered within the timelines set forth in this paragraph, the property shall be placed upon a board agenda for consideration of a county-initiated rezoning. Nothing contained within this paragraph shall impair or otherwise limit the board's authority to initiate a rezoning of property at any time subject only to vested right considerations. For purposes of this paragraph, an application for a land disturbance permit shall mean a complete application for a permit identified in chapter 7, sections 7-1.1 through 7-1.7 submitted to the department with the appropriate fee paid.

                  8-6.2. - When required. 
                  A variance, as defined by this Code, shall only be granted for the dimensional or numerical requirements of this Code and shall not be granted for the purpose of permitting a use which is not permitted in the zoning district in which the subject property is located. Dimensional or numerical requirements of this Code that may be varied are as follows: 
                  (a)  Performance standards specified for any of the various zoning districts, including buffer requirements and setbacks and any land development regulations specified for any of the various zoning districts, but specifically excluding minimum lot size or maximum density requirements. The Board of Commissioners, however, may grant a lot size variance if in addition to the criteria found in section 8-6.4(b)(4)a., the board of commissioners' determines: 
                  (1)  The variance request is for an individual residential lot not in a platted subdivision; or 
                  (2)  The variance request is for a lot in a minor subdivision. 
                  a.  If the board grants a lot size variance for either reason, the variance may not exceed ten percent of the total lot size required for a given zoning district, and it can only be granted for one lot in a minor subdivision. 
                  (b)  The provisions of chapter 10, "general provisions, and nonconforming situations." 
                  (c)  The requirements of chapter 16, "supplementary regulations for specific uses." 
                  (d)  The requirements of chapter 17, "parking and loading regulations." 
                  (e)  The requirements of chapter 18, "subdivisions and land development." 
                  (f)  The requirements of chapter 19, "conservation subdivisions." 
                  (g)  The buffer and setback requirements established in chapter 21, "overlay districts," but specifically excluding the variance of any provisions regarding permitted or prohibited uses or any minimum lot size established pursuant to that chapter.

                  (iii)  The conditions on which the request is based are unique to the property for which the relief is sought and are not applicable generally to other property; 
                  (iv)  Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, size, or topographical conditions of the specific property involved, an extraordinary hardship or practical difficulty would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of these regulations is carried out; 
                  (v)  The variance requested is the minimum necessary to accomplish the development or building; and 
                  (vi)  In the case of an amendment to a buffer or setback required by this Code, including those specified in chapter 21, the variance application shows how equal or greater protection will be achieved of the adjacent property or natural resource affected by the proposed development, should the variance be granted. 
                  (d)  Decision. Administrative review, zoning board of appeals, planning commissioner or board of commissioner approval of a variance application shall be valid in perpetuity, except that if a variance was approved as a part of, and simultaneous to, a rezoning or conditional use permit approval, then the variance shall terminate upon a change of zoning, upon a change of zoning conditions negating the basis for the variance, or upon a determination by the department that the property is being used in a manner different than the use authorized by the conditional use permit. 
                  (e)  Application for land disturbance permit or building permit. Applicants for variances approved by the director, the zoning board of appeals, the planning commission when the request is associated with a home occupation permit necessitating board approval, or the board of commissioners are eligible to continue with the development process by applying for the appropriate land disturbance permit or building permit; provided however, that all subsequent submittals are in conformance with the approved variance decision, all requirements identified in this Code, and other county, state, and federal requirements, as applicable.

The board of commissioners shall review the petition and the record in the case, within 30 days of the receipt of the petition, and determine whether to grant review.

Upon the grant of a review by the board of commissioners, the director shall schedule the matter for the next available public hearing. The petitioner and the applicant for the appeal shall be notified of the time and place when the hearing in the case will be held. 
                  (1)  General considerations for board of commissioners decision to review. A review shall be granted only in those cases in which the board of commissioners finds: 
                  a.  A procedural or substantive error which has materially prejudiced the rights of the applicant before the zoning board of appeals, or undue hardship of a personal or financial nature upon the applicant before the zoning board of appeals by reason of the denial of the application by the zoning board of appeals, such hardship not being occasioned by a negligent or willful act on the part of the applicant or attributable to him; or 
                  b.  Substantial costs laid upon the applicant before the zoning board of appeals, by reason of the denial of the application by the zoning board of appeals, such costs not being occasioned by a negligent or willful act on the part of the applicant before the zoning board of appeals or attributable to him; or 
                  c.  The director or any other official with the appropriate authority to administer the code or other county ordinances requests the board of commissioners review a zoning board of appeals' decision due to the zoning board of appeals failing to base its decision on the criteria listed in section 8-6.4(b)(4)a. of the Code or in the case of overturning an administrative decision, the zoning board of appeals failed to follow the letter and intent of the applicable Code or ordinance section; or 
                  d.  The granted variance or reversal of an administrative decision works a substantial hardship to the rights and interests of an aggrieved person disproportionate to the benefit conferred to the applicant before the zoning board of appeals; or 
                  e.  A decision by the zoning board of appeals is detrimental to the general health, welfare and safety of the public. 
                  (i)  An "act" within the meaning of the preceding subparagraphs shall also include omissions. A review will not be granted by the board of commissioners in any case in which the relief sought by the applicant before the zoning board of appeals is the direct and reasonable consequence of the applicant's violation of federal or state law or an ordinance of Forsyth County. 
                  (2)  Effect of denial of review by board of commissioners. A denial of a review by the board of commissioners shall be an affirmation of the decision of the zoning board of appeals. 
                  (c)  Public hearing. All appeals of zoning board of appeal decision applications shall receive a public hearing in accordance with the provisions as set forth in article III of this chapter. Additional notice shall be given to interested parties as determined by the director. Such notice to interested parties shall be sent by first class United States postage to the address indicated in the official tax records of the county. 
                  (1)  Receipt of evidence by board of commissioners. The board of commissioners shall receive either oral or written evidence from the petitioner, the applicant before the zoning board of appeals and from property owners and parties of record at the time the zoning board of appeals considered the matter.

The proceedings shall be recorded and shall be open to the public. 
                  (2)  Board of commissioners action. Upon conclusion of the public hearing, the board of commissioners shall consider the case and its action concerning the decision being reviewed. Its decision shall be announced in a public meeting, either following the hearing or at any other scheduled meeting. The decision of the board of commissioners shall be in writing and shall: 
                  a.  Affirm the decision of the zoning board of appeals, or 
                  b.  Return the case to the zoning board of appeals for reconsideration, with or without direction; or 
                  c.  Take such action by way of relief to the applicant as the board of commissioners deems appropriate and lawful. 
                  (d)  Board of commissioners decision. The decision of the board of commissioners shall be included in the minutes and a written report thereof shall be sent to the applicant before the zoning board of appeals and the petitioner to an address provided by the applicant before the zoning board of appeals and the petitioner. Upon the conclusion of the case, the record and all matters adduced at the hearing shall be transmitted to the director for retention. 
                  (e)  Application for land disturbance permit or building permit. The applicant is eligible to continue with the development process by applying for the appropriate land disturbance permit or building permit (if applicable); provided however, that all subsequent work and/or submittals are in conformance with the approved board of commissioner decision and all requirements identified in this Code, and other county, state, and federal requirements, as applicable.

                  It is the intent of this article to specify provisions for the filing and consideration of applications for zoning condition amendments. By requesting board action regarding zoning conditions, the applicant may be subject to additional conditions given that the board of commissioners must review the application in its entirety in determining whether an amendment is warranted.

                  8-9.2. - When required. 
                  Applications for zoning condition amendments shall be required when land development or proposed land development may be unable to comply with the approved zoning conditions that were adopted by the board of commissioners during approval of a rezoning, conditional use permit, or sketch plat application. An application for a zoning condition amendment shall also be required to amend conditions as enacted by the zoning board of appeals during an approval of a variance application. Applications for zoning condition amendments shall also be required to amend conditions placed on sketch plat applications for any application that was approved by the planning commission when they had jurisdictional decision making authority over sketch plat applications.

                  (1)  Site plan. All site plans submitted for zoning condition amendments shall be submitted in conformance with section 8-2.1(e). The site plan is only required if the requested language being modified involves a reconfiguration of the site plan approved as part of the original application.

                  (a)  Repaired, rebuilt, or altered after damage exceeding 50 percent of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, except that a structure or structures located on property zoned R3 may be, where a certificate of occupancy was issued for the structure(s) prior to December 1, 2017, rebuilt and repaired even if the structure is completely destroyed or damaged, with such rebuilt or repaired structures allowed to operate in the same manner as existed immediately prior to the event causing the damage or destruction; 
                  (b)  Enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity. For purposes of this section, conversion of any sign from a static or tri-vision sign face to LED display or an electronic message board shall constitute a prohibited enlargement or alteration which increases the non-conformity of the structure unless such conversion is authorized pursuant to the electronic message board upgrade provisions of the Forsyth County Sign Ordinance (Chapter 66 of the Code of Forsyth County).

                  (a)  Changed to another nonconforming use; 
                  (b)  Re-established after discontinuance for 60 days or more; 
                  (c)  Repaired, rebuilt or altered after damage exceeding 50 percent of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, except that a use on property zoned R3 may be, where the use was established prior to December 1, 2017, continued even if any structure where such use occurs is completely destroyed or damaged, with such use allowed to continue in the same manner as existed immediately prior to the event causing the damage or destruction to the associated structure; 
                  (d)  Enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity. For purposes of this section, conversion of any sign from a static or tri-vision to LED display or an electronic message board shall constitute a prohibited enlargement or alteration which increases the non-conformity of the use unless such conversion is authorized pursuant to the electronic message board upgrade provisions of the Forsyth County Sign Ordinance (Chapter 66 of the Code of Forsyth County, Georgia); 
                  (e)  Subparagraph (c) of section 10-2.3 shall have no application if a property owner provides evidence to the director that a use was lawful at the time of commencement of the use and that the sole basis for legal nonconformity is that the owner's lot size was reduced by way of condemnation or by sale or dedication to an entity with the power of condemnation, and that the acreage so sold, dedicated or condemned reduced the lot size such that a previously legal use became a legal nonconforming use. 
                  Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition any structure or part thereof declared to be unsafe by an official charged with protecting the public safety or health, upon order of such official.

                  Res1 districts are intended to provide for subdivisions and neighborhoods consisting of detached single family dwellings surrounded by yards that provide a desirable and healthy environment. Res1 districts provide for detached manufactured/mobile homes and site built single family detached dwellings on individual lots.

                  Editor's note— An amendment adopted December 3, 2015 repealed § 11-5.4, which pertained to special application requirements and derived from Amd. of 4-2-2015. 
                  ARTICLE VI. - SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT (RES4) 

                  11-6.1. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The Res4 district is solely intended to provide for age-restricted housing in which at least one person 55 years or older inhabits at least 90 percent of occupied units within a given development, with all applicable verification requirements to the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in UDC section 16-4.8(c) otherwise receiving compliance. The Res4 district is to be composed of single family, primarily detached dwellings, situated on smaller lots and with buildings located closely together; attached duplex and quadraplex units may also be permitted. To compensate for reduced lot sizes and setbacks, greater open space is required. Open space should be provided for throughout the development and should be accessible and available for recreational use by residents. Public water and sanitary sewer are required for developments within Res4 districts. Res4 districts shall connect to public sewer or an existing private sewage treatment plant with sufficient capacity. This district shall be considered appropriate in areas designated as such in the Forsyth County Comprehensive Plan and where compatible with surrounding land uses, density and performance standards.

                  ARTICLE VII. - MULTI FAMILY RESIDENTIAL (RES6) 

                  11-7.1. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The Res6 district is intended to provide for single family attached dwellings that allow options to increase housing variety and opportunities. In addition, Res6 districts may allow institutional type residences and other conditional institutional uses, but not to such an extent as to sacrifice the overall residential image and character. Open space should be provided for throughout the development and shall be accessible and available for recreational use by residents. Public water and sanitary sewer are required for developments within Res6 districts. Res6 districts shall connect to Public Sewer or an Existing Private Sewage Treatment Plant with Sufficient Capacity. The overall density of Res6 developments is six units per acre and therefore allows for fee simple townhouses and condominiums. This district shall be considered appropriate in areas designated as such in the Forsyth County Comprehensive Plan and where compatible with surrounding land uses, density and performance standards.

                  ARTICLE VIII. - MANUFACTURED HOME PARK DISTRICT (MHP) 

                  11-8.1. - Purpose and intent. 
                  MHP districts are intended to provide for affordable housing developments consisting of detached manufactured/mobile homes surrounded by minimal yards. The manufactured/mobile home park district is intended to provide for the leasing of spaces for the placement of manufactured/mobile homes, owned or rented by tenants, within a planned residential community. A manufactured/mobile home park is different from a residential subdivision in that the individual home spaces for manufactured/mobile homes are leased rather than platted and sold. By requiring less land per home space, manufactured/mobile home parks are built at densities greater than those for other detached dwellings. Service facilities such as laundry and leasing office are permitted uses in MHP districts. This district shall be considered appropriate in areas designated as such in the Forsyth County Comprehensive Plan and where compatible with surrounding land uses, density and performance standards.

                  (b)  Perimeter buffer or landscaping. A minimum 20-foot wide buffer, where natural vegetation exists, or where no natural vegetation exists, a landscape strip with evergreen trees and a solid wooden fence of six feet in height shall be installed and maintained around the entire perimeter of the development, except for approved access crossings. 
                  (c)  Open and recreational areas. A minimum of 20 percent of the site area shall be open space and recreational area, including the required perimeter buffer and landscaping. A minimum of five percent of the total site area, counted as part of the required 20 percent, shall be devoted to active recreational facilities. 
                  (d)  Community services. As part of the site plan review process, the developer may propose and the county may approve one or more other structures for manufactured/mobile home park occupants, such as laundries, storage, garages, parking, and park offices. Any structure that draws its trade from outside the park boundaries is prohibited. 
                  (e)  Access. The road system, both within and adjacent to the proposed park, shall be designed to meet the requirements of the County Fire Marshal's Office and the traveling public to include the following: 1) All interior roads shall be private but constructed to provide fire apparatus access and paved; 2) One-way interior roads shall be constructed with a minimum surface width of fourteen (14) feet, and shall be designated "no parking"; 3) Two-way interior roads shall be constructed with a minimum surface width of 24 feet, and shall be designated "no parking"; 4) Interior roads shall be clearly marked at each intersection to identify traffic directions and space numbers served by the road.

                  (c)  Stands. Each home space shall be provided with a concrete pad of sufficient size to accommodate the typical manufactured/mobile home to be located within that space, and the pad should be large enough to accommodate patios and provide for the anchoring of the home to secure it against movement; provided, however, that any individual stand shall be no less than 14 feet by 60 feet and spaces intended to serve double-wide homes shall be at least 24 feet by 60 feet. 
                  (d)  Use of spaces. No more than one manufactured/mobile home shall occupy any individual home space. Recreational vehicles shall not be permitted on any home space, except that park management may permit a household with a valid lease agreement for a recreational vehicle to occupy a home space on a home space not occupied by a manufactured/mobile home for a period not to exceed 14 days within any six-month period. 
                  (e)  Space identification numbers. Home space numbers at least four inches in height shall identify each home space and shall remain readily identifiable while in use. 
                  (f)  Parking. Two on-site parking spaces shall be provided on each home space or immediately off-site.

Some neighborhood activity centers exist and are developed or developing according to a conventional automobile-dependent model for suburban shopping centers. It is the intent of the county that existing neighborhood shopping districts be encouraged, as additional development and redevelopment occurs within them, to be retrofitted as neighborhood activity centers, consistent with design guidelines for activity centers specified in this chapter. New neighborhood shopping districts may be established around intersections indicated on the comprehensive plan, land use element, subject to conformance with design guidelines for activity centers specified in this chapter. 
                  Neighborhood shopping districts are activity centers that provide convenient commercial developments that serve residential areas within an approximate one-half mile radius. Generally, the uses permitted to locate in NS districts are those that have an economic threshold of 5,000 population or less. Some uses that are not retail or service in nature are also allowed so a variety of uses may locate in existing buildings. In any given location, NS districts are not intended to exceed ten acres of land or a total gross leaseable floor area of more than 75,000 square feet, and in many cases they are not that large in area or square footage. Individual establishments do not exceed 10,000 square feet. Neighborhood shopping districts contain uses of low intensity when compared to urban village districts and commercial business districts. 
                  This district is intended to discourage the random sprawl of commercial development by concentrating neighborhood-serving businesses in activity centers at road intersections rather than in a strip or linear pattern, and to limit commercial and other uses to those that do not compete with the continued development of urban villages. Objectives of the neighborhood shopping district are to encourage new smaller-scale activity centers that have definable edges, to locate shops and services at high visibility places, and to require that new buildings respect the scale and design of existing neighborhoods and fit into the streetscape. Some of the residential areas served by neighborhood shopping districts are within walking distance, and therefore, pedestrian access is facilitated and off-street parking is restricted. 
                  Development within the NS district is subject to the general site development and design regulations and is further encouraged to adhere to the design guidelines for activity centers.

                  ARTICLE II. - URBAN VILLAGE (UV) 

                  12-2.1. - Purpose and intent. 
                  These districts are intended to provide mixed use centers of moderate intensity, including primarily commercial developments that serve the recurring weekly shopping and service needs of residential areas within an approximate one and one-half to two-mile radius. Generally, the uses permitted to locate in the UV district are those that have an economic threshold of between 10,000 and 40,000 population. In any given location, UV districts are not intended to exceed seventy-five acres of land. UV districts do not exceed a total gross leasable floor area of more than 300,000 square feet for retail and service uses. Individual establishments do not exceed 60,000 square feet. "Big box" retail is not considered appropriate in urban village zoning districts unless reduced considerably in scale and intensity and developed according to design guidelines for activity centers. UV districts contain uses of approximately twice the intensity of NS districts but of lower intensity when compared to the commercial business zoning district (CBD). 
                  Urban village zoning districts are intended to discourage the random sprawl of commercial development by concentrating businesses in focus areas at road intersections rather than in a strip or linear pattern. Objectives of the urban village zoning district are to accommodate the automobile but provide environments that facilitate pedestrian access. The urban village should be pedestrian friendly and human scaled, with wide sidewalks, period furnishings and lighting, and landscape planting. Pedestrian safety must be facilitated with crosswalks, crossing lights, and shelters. Vehicular traffic should be slowed within the district and parking developed on-street where permitted and off-street. 
                  Urban villages provide for a mixture of compatible land uses. Some uses that are not retail or service in nature are also allowed so a variety of uses may locate in existing buildings. This district may also include cultural and social activities, museums, and theaters. Objectives of UV districts are to encourage activity centers that have definable edges, to locate shops and services at high visibility places, and to provide for an attractive building arrangement and streetscape.

                  ARTICLE III. - COMMERCIAL BUSINESS DISTRICT (CBD) 

                  12-3.1. - Purpose and intent. 
                  This district is intended to provide for the more intensive commercial uses that serve the weekly and less frequent shopping and service needs of the locality and region. Commercial business districts permit uses of approximately twice the intensity of village activity center districts. While the size of establishment is unlimited, those developments that are 75,000 square feet or greater are limited to location criteria as defined by sections 12-11.4(c) and 12-12.3. Development is expected to be generally auto-accommodating, although adequate provision should be made for pedestrian and bicycle access per the bicycle transportation and pedestrian plan and for public transit where appropriate. 
                  Where the future land use map shows activity center designations, pedestrian-oriented provisions are a requirement for rezoning (chapter 13 offers guidelines). Furthermore, activity center areas are intended for mixed-use developments. Zoning applications for these areas should limit individual establishments to less than 100,000 square feet (per comprehensive plan chapter 7 land use definitions). As such, a CBD zoning is not always appropriate for activity center areas. Similarly, where the future land use map indicates corridor transitional, re-zoning applications shall be considered for CBD only where applicant demonstrates elements that integrate the development with adjacent uses either through architecture, buffers, landscaping or other controls to minimize the impacts on surrounding lower intensity land uses, including conditions that limit uses to lower intensity activities.

                  ARTICLE IV. - HIGHWAY BUSINESS DISTRICT (HB) 

                  12-4.1. - Purpose and intent. 
                  These districts are intended to provide commercial activities specifically designed to serve patrons from automobiles and to serve automobile needs. Development in the highway business district is expected to be predominantly auto-accommodating. The county's intent in establishing this district is to provide for highway commercial developments while improving their appearance and function. A string of freestanding businesses leads to an anonymous character of most highways. This district is intended to provide for the gradual visual improvement of commercially developed corridors. Improvements and new development within this district must be consistent with general site development and design regulations that are designed to improve views from the roadway and provide for enhanced treatment of roadway edges. Strip commercial revitalization districts must protect adjacent single family residential areas with buffers and screening. The reuse of aging commercial areas is encouraged to reinforce the county's efforts to remain free of blight over the long term.

                  ARTICLE V. - HEAVY COMMERCIAL DISTRICT (HC) 

                  12-5.1. - Purpose and intent. 
                  These districts are intended to provide areas for the operation of heavy commercial uses such as contractor's establishments, open storage yards, and pre-fabricated metal shop and pole buildings. These districts are not suitable for location adjacent to single family residential subdivisions unless extensively buffered, screened, and separated from residential neighborhoods. Heavy commercial uses are generally not compatible with retail shopping and service uses, because they are not frequented by the traveling public but instead cater to a limited clientele. HC districts do not create pedestrian friendly environments. These areas do not necessarily require highway frontage but have access to major roads either directly or through other commercially zoned properties. Due to their infrequent or low volume use, heavy equipment storage and use areas are not necessary required to be paved with asphalt or concrete but must be appropriately surfaced with at least gravel and drained. Uses that require frequent visitations should provide for paved parking areas. Equipment and storage yards are typically required to be secured with chain link fencing, including barbed wire top strands. Lighting of yards is required for security purposes but not at a level needed for nighttime human activity. Activity is dormant outside of regular business hours, except for occasional starting, exiting, and entering of service vehicles and trucks.

                  ARTICLE VI. - BUSINESS PARK (BP) 

                  12-6.1. - Purpose and intent. 
                  These districts are established to promote sound and harmonious economic development by providing high-quality business and distribution sites for research laboratories, wholesale centers, and commerce in an attractive, campus-style setting with good access to major roads and provided with public water supply and sewerage. Generally, a business park requires ten acres or more of land, with frontage on a state highway or with arterial access connecting to a nearby state highway, and requires the development of one or more new public roads built to accommodate large trucks. Business parks are intended to accommodate the overnight parking and storage of trucks and truck trailers subject to consistency with a campus-style environment. Roads and utilities are installed for multiple development sites that are graded and prepared for individual sale or lease. Campus developments that include individual sites to be sold and developed must comply with applicable requirements for subdivisions. In addition, proposals for BP districts are expected to submit for public review, and abide by, a set of restrictive covenants designed to ensure an attractive campus-style environment and compatibility with adjacent land uses.

                  ARTICLE VII. - OFFICE AND INSTITUTIONAL DISTRICT (OandI) 

                  12-7.1. - Purpose and intent. 
                  These districts are established to promote the development of a complementary mix of professional, medical, and general offices and institutional uses that are oriented toward the provision of services rather than the sale of products. Generally, OandI districts are intended to accommodate office developments that provide in the aggregate less than 75,000 square feet of gross floor area. Office developments greater than 75,000 square feet are appropriate in CBD districts, or integrated into urban villages. Business services and restaurants that are integrated into, and which are primarily intended to serve office parks containing at least 50,000 square feet of gross floor area, are permitted so as to reduce vehicle trips. Restaurants that serve more than the office park or that cater to passerby traffic may be permitted as conditional uses. OandI districts may be appropriate as a transition between activity centers and single family residential neighborhoods, although vacant tracts situated as such shall not necessarily be assumed to be appropriate for OandI zoning.

                  ARTICLE VIII. - OFFICE RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT (OR) 

                  12-8.1. - Purpose and intent. 
                  These districts are appropriate in areas situated between activity centers or office and institutional districts and single family residential areas. These districts are intended to provide for low intensity, small-scale offices that do not exceed 5,000 square feet of gross floor area devoted to offices on an individual site. Development is intended to be of an intensity, scale, and character similar to nearby residential development to promote compatibility with the surrounding area. All new development is required to be in architectural harmony with existing residential structures. 
                  OR districts are particularly appropriate for properties that front collector or arterial streets on the fringe of stable residential neighborhoods. Rezoning to the OR district is anticipated at the individual parcel level in such locations, though parcels situated as such shall not necessarily be assumed to appropriate for OR uses. Development within OR districts are expected to have roof-pitches and architectural treatments similar to detached single-family residences, parking areas in proportion to single family residential uses, and site development features that ensure a coexistence with the adjacent, quiet residential living environment. OR districts allow the conversion of existing residential structures to offices. Small-scale institutional residential facilities are permitted as conditional uses.

                  ARTICLE IX. - OFFICE COMMERCIAL MULTIPLE STORY (OCMS) 

                  12-9.1. - Purpose and intent. 
                  These districts are intended to provide for significant vertical (multi-story) developments within employment centers. Uses within these districts are primarily office and major institutional uses but may include a mix of retail, service, and restaurant space, typically on the ground floor within a single building. Only those commercial uses that support a predominantly pedestrian orientation are permitted. Automobile-related businesses, open air businesses, open storage yards, and other uses that do not support pedestrian activity between and among uses in the employment center are not permitted. Individual business establishments do not exceed 25,000 square feet in these districts. 
                  A minimum of 15 acres is required to establish an office-commercial multi-story district; this requirement is intended to ensure that buildings and developments are master planned, to provide adequate setbacks and buffering, and to avoid small-scale, piecemeal, uncoordinated development of multi-story buildings that would be out of character with the purposes of this district. Minimum building setbacks are greater in these districts because of the greater height permitted. These districts are not appropriate adjacent to residential and office residential districts unless extensively separated and buffered at side and rear property lines according to a sliding scale of increased buffer widths and building setbacks determined on the basis of the number of stories. In most instances, multi-story buildings will need to be accompanied by decked parking structures rather than (or in addition to) surface parking lots because of the limitations on building coverage and the minimum open space requirements. These districts are only appropriate in areas with arterial road access and where developments are adequately served by public water, sanitary sewerage, fire, emergency medical services, police and/or private security, and other public facilities and services.

                  (3)  See Ordinance No. 103 (Shooting Range Ordinance). 
                  (4)  In cases where a use is proposed but is not listed in this table, the director shall make an administrative determination as to whether or not the use is permitted in the zoning district or districts in question. The director will compare the proposed use to substantially similar uses to determine if the proposed use will be considered a prohibited, permitted, or conditional use. In making such determinations, the director shall consult the purpose and intent statements of the zoning district or districts in question, in addition to comparing the use in question to uses specifically listed in this table. 
                  (5)  Places of worship for which a CUP, rezoning or development permit application is being processed, that have been approved but not constructed, that are under construction, or that have received a Certificate of Occupancy prior to February 2, 2017, are exempt from the size cap. In addition, property immediately adjacent to the property on which a place of worship that is exempt pursuant to this note is located, that is purchased after February 2, 2017, is also exempt from the size cap. For properties exempted from the size cap pursuant to this note, the requirements for places of worship 10,000 square feet or less in aggregate size (either conditional use permit (C) or not permitted (X)) shall apply for each zoning district. For purposes of this chart, "aggregate size" shall mean total square footage of all structures on the property on which the place of worship is located.

                  Notes:  Table 12.2 
                  (1)  A smaller area can be rezoned to this category if combined with an existing and when combined, the two parcels meet this minimum size. 
                  (2)  This provision does not apply to manufacturing, processing, and assembling, office uses, and wholesale or warehousing uses, when permitted and located in the BP district. 
                  (3)  The minimum heated floor area per dwelling unit excludes common areas such as common hallways and shared spaces. This performance standard is solely for those properties zoned commercial with a conditional use permit for residential dwellings approved prior to the May 17, 2004 amendments to the UDC. This performance standard should not be interpreted as permitting residential dwellings in a commercial district. 
                  (4)  Measured from the dedicated right-of-way. 
                  (5)  The side building setback/side yard in a NS, UV, or CBD zoning district may be reduced to zero setback on a side where an existing building(s) on property abutting the subject property is or will be constructed without a side building setback/side yard. The purpose of this provision is to allow for a continuous building façade across property lines to create a pedestrian-oriented streetscape that would otherwise be interrupted by a side setback requirement. 
                  (6)  Where permitted, single family detached dwellings, single family attached dwellings, two family dwellings (duplexes), and multifamily dwellings within the NS, UV and CBD districts shall be limited to 25 percent of the total acreage. Such residential uses shall be connected to sewer. This performance standard is solely for those properties zoned commercial with a conditional use permit for residential dwellings approved prior to the May 17, 2004 amendments to the UDC. This performance standard should not be interpreted as permitting residential dwellings in a commercial district.

                  ARTICLE X. - GENERAL SITE DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN REGULATIONS FOR ALL COMMERCIAL AND OFFICE DISTRICTS 

                  12-10.1. - Purpose and intent. 
                  Careful attention to attractive and citizen-friendly urban design is in the economic interests of the county, its citizens, and business owners. The county's land use element of the comprehensive plan places an emphasis on design guidelines to improve the aesthetic appearance and function of the county's commercial areas. The land use element reveals civic concerns over design-related issues, such as pedestrian access, safe bike routes, roadway landscaping and medians, attractive shopping centers, and less intrusive parking lots. Attractive and integrated urban design features tend to improve the county's image, raise overall property values, attract new businesses and residents, and improve the quality of life. Investment in design features tends to result in a positive return on investment for government, private industry, and property owners. For example, the money spent on landscaped roadway medians, sidewalks, and street trees is likely to be amply returned in the form of increased tax revenue resulting from the overall increase in property values that accompanies attractive and desirable urban and suburban areas. 
                  Much of the existing commercial development in Forsyth County, particularly development along the county's principal highways, is in need of aesthetic and functional enhancement. Existing conditions that are inconsistent with the objectives of the county's land use element include: chain link fencing enclosures of autos and trailers without adequate screening; various building materials and/or equipment stored in front yards in view of the traveling public; continuous, uncurbed, highway access; old, dilapidated, and/or unattractive awnings and façade treatments; excessive signage in the form of fluttering ribbons, portable signs, sandwich signs, and welcome flags; a lack of front yard landscaping; storage/maintenance bay doors and loading areas facing the highway; dumpsters placed in front/side yards in unobstructed view from highways; and a general lack of interparcel access (i.e., connections between adjacent developments). 
                  It is the intent of Forsyth County to require that new commercial developments install appropriate improvements and comply with general design regulations that are intended to improve aesthetic appearance and function. It is also the intent of the county to require substantial progress toward compliance with these improvement requirements and general design regulations in cases where existing businesses are expanded. 
                  These design regulations are intended to merge traffic engineering, civil engineering, urban design, landscape architecture, and land use planning principles into a set of regulations for commercial developments and properties in the unincorporated areas of the county. The regulations are the minimum necessary to: preserve the carrying capacity of major arteries; reduce the number of vehicular turning movements to and from the major artery, thereby reducing the potential for automobile and pedestrian traffic accidents; encourage and promote the most suitable uses of land; ensure the adequate grading and draining of developments; promote an environment which reduces the visual clutter and other distracting characteristics resulting from various aspects typical of urban and suburban commercial strip development; prohibit the needless, wasteful and purposeless aesthetic degradation of the county's highway and major street corridors; and promote a more healthy environment. 
                  (Ord. No. 87, 1-11-2006) 
                  12-10.2. - Applicability. 
                  This article shall apply to all properties located within all commercial and office zoning districts of unincorporated Forsyth County. New development shall be required to conform to these regulations. A substantial improvement of an existing development shall be required to conform to these regulations or make substantial progress toward meeting the regulations contained within this chapter. 
                  (Ord. No. 87, 1-11-2006) 
                  12-10.3. - Utilities. 
                  All telephone and electricity transmission lines serving uses on site shall be installed underground. 
                  (Ord. No. 87, 1-11-2006) 
                  12-10.4. - Grading and site development. 
                  Buildings and parking lots shall be appropriately drained so as to prevent damage to abutting properties or public streets. Grading plans for new development shall be submitted to the director, who shall disseminate the plans to all appropriate departments for review and approval, and all grading activities shall comply with approved plans. Stormwater management plans shall be submitted to the director and shall be reviewed by the director of engineering for review and approval, and all such drainage improvements shall be designed, installed and maintained in accordance with the standards of Ordinance No. 75 (Storm Water Management Ordinance) as adopted and as may be amended from time to time. All disturbed or graded ground areas of a building site not used for buildings or open storage areas shall be appropriately stabilized and grassed or covered with plants or landscaping materials. 
                  (Ord. No. 87, 1-11-2006) 
                  12-10.5. - Curb cuts and access specifications. 
                  All entrances or exits of any street or driveway, public or private, from or to any state highway shall be approved by the state department of transportation and the director of engineering prior to the construction of such entrances or exits and prior to the issuance of any development permit for any improvement to be served by such entrances or exits. 
                  No curb cut or access driveway shall be permitted to be located closer than 100 feet to the nearest existing or proposed right-of-way of an intersecting roadway or closer than 40 feet to a side property line unless the adjacent property owner is in agreement with the encroachment of the driveway and approval is obtained from the director of engineering. Curb cuts or access driveways shall be no narrower than 24 feet from back of curb to back of curb. Strict adherence to these requirements may not be practical in all instances as determined by the director of engineering. The director of engineering may limit the maximum width of a curb cut and/or the number of curb cuts to a parcel as necessary when it is deemed to be of benefit to the safety and welfare of the public. 
                  The director of engineering must approve any commercial or office development accessed by an easement. Such approval will only be granted upon verification that the proposed access maintains a safe and efficient transportation network. 
                  In cases of a substantial improvement of an existing development on a site that does not meet these curb cut and access specifications, the applicant may be required by the director of engineering to prepare an access plan as part of plans for the substantial improvement that either meets these requirements or moves substantially toward compliance with these regulations. Approval by the Georgia Department of Transportation and the director of engineering shall be required, as applicable. 
                  Additional right-of-way shall be dedicated to the public as required by the most current functional classification of Forsyth County roads as designated in the major transportation plan. Roadway entrances and improvements, including necessary acceleration and/or deceleration lane(s) and right/left turn lanes, shall be designed, installed, and maintained as approved by the state department of transportation, as applicable, or the director of engineering, in accordance with state or county requirements, as applicable and as may be amended from time to time. 
                  The following factors may be considered during the review and approval of a specific location of an entrance: 1) The location of existing or planned median breaks; 2) separation requirements between the entrance and major intersections; 3) separation requirements between other entrances; 4) the need to provide shared access with other sites; 5) the need to align with previously approved or constructed access points on the opposite side of the street; 6) and the minimum number of entrances needed to move traffic onto and off the site safely and efficiently.

                  12-10.6. - Interparcel connections. 
                  New development that contains or is intended to contain more than one building or use on site shall provide connections so that automobile trips between and among such buildings or uses can be accomplished without using the highway or major street. New developments and substantial improvements to existing developments shall provide for pedestrian and automobile access connections between adjacent properties under different ownership when the uses of the properties are of such compatibility that patrons may frequent both buildings or uses in the same vehicle trip.

                  12-10.7. - Location of loading and unloading areas. 
                  All areas and facilities devoted to the loading and unloading of goods and merchandise shall be located to the side or rear of the building and lot. Loading and unloading areas shall not front the right-of-way of the highway or major street. Overhead doors for loading bays shall not face the highway or major street. 
                  In cases where this regulation is not practical for new development, or in cases where an existing building to be substantially improved does not meet the requirements in this section, the property shall be screened from view from the highway or major street along the entire property frontage, except in cases where access areas are approved. Buildings that are permitted to have overhead doors facing the public right-of-way shall incorporate design features so that aesthetic impact of the overhead doors is softened through architectural detailing, or staggering with recesses and projections.

                  In commercial zoning districts where permitted, the outside storage or display of vehicles, equipment, and merchandise to be rented, leased, or sold, shall be visible along no more than 30 percent of the frontage of the property abutting the highway or major street, excluding approved driveway entrances and exits. Major streets include all roads classified by the Forsyth County Transportation Plan as minor arterial and greater and include Freedom Parkway, Ronald Reagan Boulevard and Old Atlanta Road. Screening may be accomplished by vegetation, by a building that meets architectural standards of this chapter, by an earthen berm, by a 100 percent opaque, solid wooden fence or wall, or combination of these screening methods. Vegetative screening must be specified on the applicant's landscape plan. The use of low-lying landscaping that does not screen the display areas from view from the public right-of-way shall not be deemed to comply with this requirement.

                  ARTICLE XI. - ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR LARGE-SCALE RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS 40,000 SQUARE FEET OR GREATER 

                  12-11.1. - Purpose and intent. 
                  "Large-scale retail" refers to any individual retail establishment that is 40,000 square feet or greater. This size threshold refers to an individual establishment and its associated outdoor areas used for display and storage. The purpose of establishing requirements for large-scale retail establishments is to apply design standards and additional conditions to large developments proposed in Forsyth County in order to ensure that such developments are appropriately located, are integrated with surrounding area or positively contribute to the changing community character, and meet the county's goals for new commercial development per the comprehensive plan. As such, these regulations intend to promote high quality materials and design, promote pedestrian-friendly environments, encourage infrastructure concurrency, and encourage responsible storm-water management practices. 
                  Furthermore, within newly emerging centers of commercial activity, large-scale retail development plays an important role in defining the direction of the community character. In the absence of previously adopted overlay design standards regulating sites for new large-scale retail, prior to the issuance of a land-disturbance permit, applicants shall work with planning and community development staff to establish an architectural theme for the area in keeping with surrounding characteristics and/or with the sub-area vision documented in the comprehensive plan. The architectural theme area shall be the subject of a future overlay designation to be defined by the board of commissioners.

                  12-11.2. - Restrictive covenants. 
                  For individual retail establishments 75,000 square feet or greater, a landlord shall not be permitted to enter into a lease agreement whereby the landlord is precluded from marketing and renting to future lessees once a tenant has vacated the premises. Once a tenant has vacated the premises, the landlord shall be free to market to any person or company allowed by county codes.

                  12-11.3. - Delivery and garbage pick-up. 
                  Hours for truck delivery or for garbage pick-up services shall be limited to the hours between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. Trucks shall turn off their engines during deliveries; trucks with refrigeration units may be exempt from this provision. Signs posted in delivery area shall advise truck drivers of this requirement.

                  12-11.4. - Infrastructure requirements. 
                  (a)  Availability of sewer. Large-scale retail establishments shall be served by either public sewer, or an existing private sewage treatment plant. Private sewage treatment plant service shall only be approved if the proposed site was approved by the Forsyth County BOC as part of the service area for the private plant. If the property where the development is to be located is already correctly zoned, proof of sewer availability must be demonstrated prior to a land disturbance permit being issued. If the property needs to be rezoned or obtain sketch plat approval, the applicant for the rezoning/sketch plat approval must demonstrate sewer will be available within one year of the rezoning/sketch plat request being approved or by the time a land disturbance permit is issued, whichever is sooner. In no case shall a certificate of occupancy be released without existing, operational access to off-site sewage treatment. 
                  (b)  Traffic study. A traffic study is required for all large-scale retail development. Two copies of said traffic study shall be submitted with all rezoning requests and/or sketch plat applications for approval by the director of engineering. If rezoning or sketch plat approval is not required, two copies of a traffic study shall be submitted with an application for a land disturbance permit. Based on the approved traffic study, the Forsyth County Master Transportation Plan, and any other local, state or federal requirements, the director of engineering shall determine all necessary road improvements to be completed. 
                  (c)  Access road classification. Additionally, individual retail establishments 75,000 square feet or greater shall not be accessed via minor collector or local streets, as classified by the master transportation plan, unless there is also frontage on a road of higher classification (arterial, highway, etc). Under exceptionally unusual circumstances, if there already exists a concentration of commercial activity, the director of engineering may waive the road classification criteria based upon documentation that road improvements with identified funding sources will accommodate anticipated project-generated traffic volume to the degree that LOS D or better is maintained for the affected road segment.

                  12-11.5. - Site design guidelines and requirements. 
                  (a)  Open Space. A minimum of 20 percent of the site shall be landscaped open space. 
                  (b)  Location of loading and unloading areas. All areas and facilities devoted to loading and unloading of goods and merchandise shall be located to the side or rear of the building and lot. Location should be restricted, however, to whichever location does not abut a residentially zoned property, if applicable. 
                  (c)  Outdoor storage and display. Neither parking lots, nor areas immediately adjacent to the buildings other than garden center uses shall be used for storage or sale of goods. Garden center goods shall be within areas enclosed by decorative fencing and be at least partially screened. Display or sale of goods outside the interior permanent and sheltered portions of a building is prohibited. Exceptions to this provision include: seasonal holiday trees, seasonal sales of nursery supplies, and pumpkin sales. In no instance shall outdoor display obstruct sidewalks or otherwise impede pedestrian movement to entrance of the store. 
                  (d)  Setbacks and buffer, adjacent to residentially zoned parcels. If the subject property abuts a residential, OR, A1, or AG-Res district, the following minimum side or rear setback and buffer requirements apply: 
                  (1)  The minimum building setback shall be 100 feet, the first 50 feet being an undisturbed buffer, which shall meet the requirements of the Forsyth County Buffer Standards. 
                  (2)  To ensure that a visual buffer is achieved, the county may or may not require the installation of a four-foot high earthen berm with plantings per the Forsyth County Buffer Standards. The county arborist will make the determination of a berm requirement based upon a review of the tree protection and replacement plan and existing topography and vegetation. 
                  (e)  Landscaping. 
                  (1)  Walkways shall feature adjoining planted landscaped areas for no less than 50 percent of their length. 
                  (2)  Along the building façade featuring the primary entrance, within in an area no further than 15 feet from the foundation, there shall be landscaping with trees. Minimum installation requires four and one-half caliper inches per 100 linear feet with a one and one-half-inch caliper and eight-foot installation height minimum for each tree. Trees shall count towards the tree density requirement as outlined in Ordinance No. 98 (Tree Protection and Replacement Ordinance). Tree placement should be grouped and staggered rather than following a regulated line along the façade. Tree placement must be approved by the county arborist. Trees located in the sidewalks or other areas subject to pedestrian traffic shall require tree grates or other suitable tree protection measures; method of tree protection shall be indicated on plans. 
                  (3)  Landscape strips requirements. In addition to section 12-10.15: 
                  a.  The required minimum landscape strip shall be 20-feet wide along the entire property fronting a public street. 
                  b.  All landscape strips are required to contain a combination of at least two of the following elements: vegetative ground cover, herbaceous ornamentals, or low to mid-level shrubs; they must also include a combination of large canopy trees with either understory trees or large shrubs. One-third of landscaping plantings shall be of the evergreen variety. Understory trees must be six to eight feet in height at time of planting. Large shrubs must be four to six feet in height at time of planting and reach a height of at least eight feet. 
                  (4)  Landscape installment and maintenance. A landscape installment guaranty must be provided prior to the release of certificate of occupancy (CO). The guaranty shall be stamped and signed by a registered landscape architect certifying that landscaping meets the standards of this Code. Landscape plantings must be replaced if damaged or dead. 
                  (f)  Parking and pedestrian circulation and parking islands. Parking areas are transitional spaces where users change modes of travel from car, bus or bicycle to pedestrian. As such, parking areas should provide safe, convenient, and efficient access to serve all travel modes. They should be distributed around large buildings in order to shorten the distance to other buildings and public sidewalks and to reduce the overall visual impact of the paved surface. If buildings are located closer to streets, the visual scale of the complex is reduced, pedestrian traffic is encouraged, and architectural details take on added importance. 
                  (1)  Parking lot location. Parking areas should be distributed around large buildings along not less than two façades (front, rear or sides) in order to shorten the distance to other buildings and public sidewalks. Parking shall be of an adequate distance from loading areas as to avoid any points of conflict and ensure pedestrian safety. No more than 50 percent of the off-street parking area for the lot, tract or area of land devoted to the large retail establishment should be located along the property fronting a public road and between the front façade and the road (the "front parking area"). See Figures 1, 2, and 3 for examples that compare desirable layouts to traditional parking distribution.

                  (2)  Parking lot location and parking islands requirements. Large-scale retail establishments shall provide a minimum of 15 percent of the total front parking area as landscaped islands. Side and rear parking lots shall provide a minimum of 12.5 percent of the total parking area as landscaped islands. 
                  a.  Each parking island is required to contain a combination of at least two of the following elements: grass, shrubbery, flowers, or other landscaping material, in addition to the tree requirements delineated below. 
                  b.  Parking island tree specifications. In addition to the requirements of the Ordinance No. 98 (Tree Protection and Replacement Ordinance), the following standards for tree islands apply: 
                  (i)  Trees shall be provided and maintained adjacent to, and in the interior portion of, parking lots in a ratio of one tree for each seven parking spaces. In addition, every parking space shall be within 50 feet of the trunk of a tree. 
                  (ii)  Trees shall be at least three inches in caliper and shall be an overstory species. The minimum planting area or island for each tree shall be at least 200 square feet. If shared with other trees, 100 square feet for each additional tree shall be added. 
                  (iii)  Each planting area or island shall not be less than four feet in width in any direction. Each landscape island shall be maintained such that plantings are allowed to be established. Any dead plantings shall be replaced. 
                  c.  Landscape islands shall be located at the end of every parking bay and at every 150 linear feet of continuous parking space. Measuring from the trunk, the tree must be a minimum of six feet from the back of the curb. No portion of an island less than three feet in width may be counted in the area. Landscape islands for single parking bays shall contain a minimum of 200 square feet. Landscape islands for double parking bays shall require a minimum of two 200 square foot islands or one continuous landscape island of 400 square feet. 
                  d.  Landscape islands shall be located in such a manner as to divide and break up the parking area. A planting area, which intrudes upon or is located wholly within a generally rectangular area that is (a) devoted to parking and (b) between a building and a lot line or between two buildings will generally serve this purpose. 
                  (3)  Pedestrian circulation. 
                  a.  Sidewalks at least five feet in width shall be provided along all sides of the lot that abut a public street. 
                  b.  Continuous internal pedestrian walkways, no less than five feet in width, shall be provided from the public sidewalk or right-of-way to the principal customer entrance of all principal buildings on the site. At a minimum, walkways shall connect focal points of pedestrian activity such as, but not limited to, transit stops, street crossings, building and store entry points. 
                  c.  Sidewalks, no less than five feet in width, shall be provided along the full length of the building along any façade featuring a customer entrance, and along any façade abutting public parking areas. Such sidewalks shall be located at least six feet from the façade of the building to meet landscaping requirements in section 12-11.5(e)(2) above. 
                  d.  All internal pedestrian walkways shall be distinguished from driving surfaces through the use of color and durable, low maintenance surface materials such as pavers, bricks, or scored concrete to enhance pedestrian safety and comfort, as well as the attractiveness of the walkways. 
                  (4)  Excess parking. To avoid excessive parking surpluses which increase impervious surfaces, parking shall not be provided in quantities greater than ten percent of the required minimum. For large-scale retail developments exceeding the minimum parking requirements, all excess parking shall be of porous material. 
                  (5)  Interconnectivity. Unless waived by the planning and community development director, developments shall provide direct connections and safe street crossings to adjacent land uses, either to existing adjacent commercial (via shared curb-cuts or cross-access easements) or plan for such connectivity to future adjacent commercial by providing drive-way stub-out. 
                  (g)  Transit stops. Large-scale retail developments 75,000 square feet or greater shall cooperate with the Georgia Department of Transportation and the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority or its successor to establish park and ride lots should these agents deem the site an appropriate location. 
                  (h)  Public spaces. Each retail establishment subject to these standards shall contribute to the establishment or enhancement of community and public spaces by providing at least two of the following: patio/seating area, pedestrian plaza with benches, transportation center, window shopping walkway, outdoor playground area, kiosk area, water feature, clock tower, or other such deliberately shaped area and/or a focal feature or amenity that, in the judgment of the planning and community development director, adequately enhances such community and public spaces. Any such areas shall have direct access to the public sidewalk network and such features shall not be constructed of materials that are inferior to the principal materials of the building and landscape. 
                  (Ord. No. 87, 1-11-2006; Amd. of 11-1-2007; Amd. of 7-1-2010; Amd. of 12-1-2011; Amd. of 9-7-2017(8)) 
                  12-11.6. - Architectural design standards. 
                  The intent of architectural design standards is to ensure a base level of quality architecture that is responsive to its context and contributes to the architectural character of an area rather than a design solution that is based on a standardized formula or market prototype superimposed on the selected site. 
                  All buildings shall be designed to be compatible with the surrounding land uses. In predominantly rural or rural-residential areas, proposals must demonstrate landscaping and architectural treatment aimed to integrate into the surrounding character; in the case of poor context (i.e., areas in transition or ready for redevelopment) then the proposed development will cultivate new standards for the area by meeting the minimum requirements below. 
                  FIGURE 4 

                  Source: City of Toledo 
                  In multiple building developments, all buildings and structures in the development shall be of similar architectural style and shall demonstrate an overall cohesive architectural theme that creates a sense of place. Building design that is based on a standardized formula associated with a business or franchise shall be modified to meet the provisions of this section. 
                  (a)  Facades and exterior walls. 
                  (1)  Front façades greater than 100 feet in length, measured horizontally, shall incorporate wall plane projections or recesses having a depth of at least three percent of the length of the façade. No uninterrupted length of any façade shall exceed 100 horizontal feet. 
                  (2)  Minimum wall articulation. Front façade design shall provide varying wall offsets and other architectural features to create horizontal (wall) and vertical building articulation. Along with the wall plane requirements in (1) above, at least two of the following treatments shall be incorporated: 
                  (a)  Change in texture or masonry pattern. 
                  (b)  Fenestrian (window treatment). 
                  (c)  An expression of architectural or structural bays through a change in plane no less than 12 inches in width, such as an offset, reveal or projecting rib. 
                  (d)  An equivalent element that subdivides the wall into pedestrian scale proportions, as approved by the director of planning.

                  (b)  Entryways. 
                  (1)  The principle entry area of a building or, if among larger development, the largest tenant or central location of a group of buildings shall be articulated and should express greater architectural detail than other portions of the building, featuring no fewer than three of the following elements: 
                  (a)  Overhangs. 
                  (b)  Canopies. 
                  (c)  Recesses/projections. 
                  (d)  Arcades. 
                  (e)  Corniced parapets over the door. 
                  (f)  Peaked roof forms. 
                  (g)  Arches. 
                  (h)  Display windows. 
                  (i)  Moldings or tile work integrated into the building. 
                  (j)  Integral planters or wing walls that incorporate landscaped areas and/or places for sitting. 
                  Where additional stores will be located in the large retail establishment, each such store that is 5,000 square feet and greater shall have at least one exterior customer entrance, which shall conform to the above requirements. 
                  (c)  Roof features. Rooflines shall incorporate roof features (extensions, and/or projections such as gable, hip, parapet, dormers or others) that achieve visual interest through variation along 35 percent of the entire horizontal length of roofline. These features shall conform to the following specifications: 
                  (1)  Roof projections shall extend a minimum 15 feet from the exterior wall except for parapet extensions which shall rise a minimum of ten feet above the parapet's baseline. Parapets shall feature three dimensional cornice treatment. Roof features shall not exceed the average height of the supporting walls. 
                  (2)  Cornices, if present, shall feature three dimensional treatments of not less than 12 inches in profile. Overhang eaves, if present, shall extend no less than three feet past the supporting walls. 
                  (3)  The roof pitch of sloped roofs shall be a minimum of 4:12. 
                  (d)  Screening rooftop equipment. Roof top equipment such as HVAC units shall be fully screened. Screening shall be of material that serves as sound proofing to minimize noise trespass. 
                  FIGURE 6 

                  (e)  Colors. Facades shall be of low reflectance, subtle, neutral or earth tone colors. The use of high intensity colors, primary colors, metallic colors, black or fluorescent colors is prohibited. Building trim and accent areas may feature higher intensity colors, subject to approval of the planning and community development director. 
                  (f)  Exterior building material. The following building materials are prohibited from front and side façades: smooth-faced concrete block, plastic siding, smooth-faced tilt-up concrete panels, corrugated metal siding, and prefabricated steel panels. Textured concrete masonry units (CMU) is permitted but shall be limited to 70 percent of total front façade with remaining façade material composed of brick, stone, stucco, glass or other high quality material. Tilt-up panels may be used only for rear loading areas that are not visible to the public. 
                  (g)  Exemptions. The planning and community development director may exempt all or parts of the design standards in this section for commissioned buildings by an architect for a site when the design constitutes a unique, one of a kind building that meets or exceeds the intent of these design standards, as demonstrated by architectural elevations.

                  ARTICLE XII. - ADDITIONAL LOCATION AND ZONING REQUIREMENTS FOR LARGE-SCALE RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS 75,000 SQUARE FEET OR GREATER 
                  Individual large-scale retail establishments 75,000 square feet or greater shall comply with the provisions of this section to minimize their public impacts. This section regulates the location of individual retail establishments that are 75,000 square feet or greater and ensures that excessively sized buildings do not remain abandoned and/or empty for a significant period of time. The 75,000 square foot threshold refers to an individual structure and its associated outdoor areas used for display and storage. 

                  12-12.1. - Re-use of properties. 
                  Plans for the removal or adaptive re-use of the principal structure governed by this ordinance shall be made should the facility not be used for commercial retail purposes for a period of 24 consecutive months. 
                  The owner and/or lessee meets the intent of this section if he or she provides an executed lease, a sale agreement or evidence of a pending lease/sale agreement (executed within 24 months), or executes an adaptive reuse agreement with the county. 
                  (Ord. No. 87, 1-11-2006) 
                  12-12.2. - Vacancy maintenance requirements. 
                  In addition to maintenance requirements established by UDC 10-1.14, owner shall provide security patrols on the site to deter vandalism or other illegal activities on the property. 
                  (Ord. No. 87, 1-11-2006) 
                  12-12.3. - Location criteria. 
                  Individual retail establishments 75,000 square feet or greater may only locate on property that is properly zoned and meets the location criteria established herein. Establishments under the same corporate ownership proposed on the same development site but with separate structures aimed to defeat the intent of this Code may still be limited to this location criteria, per administrative decision by the planning and community development director. In addition to the items established in Chapter 8 of this Code, for considering zoning amendments, the following will be considered to evaluate approval or denial of proposed large-scale retail use: 
                  (a)  Areas identified by the future land use map as activity center use are generally not appropriate for individual large-scale establishments that are 75,000 square feet or greater and the comprehensive plan explicitly states nothing greater than 100,000 square feet should be considered within activity centers; applicant must demonstrate exceptional efforts for pedestrian-oriented and village-center oriented site-design for this use to be considered appropriate within activity center designations. 
                  (b)  Individual establishments 75,000 square feet or greater shall not be adjacent to existing residential subdivisions composed of 30 lots or more, except that this prohibition shall not be applicable if along the shared property line a 150 foot setback is provided, of which 100 feet shall be an undisturbed buffer. Furthermore, the undisturbed buffer shall be augmented with plantings per the county buffer standards if existing vegetation does not achieve the intended visual screen. 
                  (Ord. No. 87, 1-11-2006) 
                  CHAPTER 13. - DESIGN GUIDELINES FOR ACTIVITY CENTERS 
                  ARTICLE I. - PURPOSE AND INTENT 

                  13-1.1. - Purpose and intent. 
                  This chapter presents a set of general design guidelines for the development of neighborhood shopping districts and urban village districts. Such guidelines are in addition to, and do not negate or supersede, the regulations applicable to activity centers in article X of chapter 12 and any other applicable requirements of this Code. Requests to rezone property to a neighborhood shopping district or urban village district shall be evaluated against these design guidelines, and substantial nonconformity with these design guidelines may be the basis for denying a request for neighborhood shopping or urban village zoning districts. 
                  Development designs should utilize the opportunities and reflect the constraints created by flood plains, slopes, soils, native vegetation, and other physical features. Engineering techniques should not be utilized to force-fit development into the natural environment. 
                  (Amd. of 11-15-2004) 
                  ARTICLE II. - DESIGN STANDARDS 

                  13-2.1. - Detention basins. 
                  Open storm drainage and detention areas visible to the public should be incorporated into the design of the development as an attractive amenity or focal point. For example, spray fountains or water falls are attractive alternatives for moving water. Wet-bottom basins are encouraged for basins visible to the public or from adjacent property. Dry basins, where used, should be sloped adequately to ensure proper surface drainage, designed so slopes and bottoms can be easily maintained, and extensively landscaped. 
                  13-2.2. - Connectivity and roadway design criteria. 
                  The roadway pattern within an activity center should not require short trips between developments in the activity center to use arterials; it should be possible for trips of this sort to be made using access connections between developments within the activity center. The road network of any one development or site within the activity center should interconnect with the road network of any adjacent development or site within the activity center. Developments where the internal road networks are isolated from all adjacent sites are discouraged. 

                  Where compatible, automobile trips from adjacent residential neighborhood(s) to the neighborhood shopping zoning district or urban village zoning district should be possible without requiring travel along the major street. Outparcels should be connected to and served from the internal streets of the activity center of which they are a part. Major driveways serving the activity center should include planted center medians. Planted medians are desired because they: 1) enhance the overall appearance of the activity center and improve economic attractiveness; 2) provide refuge for pedestrians; and 3) improve traffic safety. Road speeds within an activity center should generally not exceed 30 mph, and should be compatible with the pedestrian nature and scale of the activity center. 
                  13-2.3. - Building height and mass. 
                  Within an activity center, a logical hierarchy of building forms should be created. Building heights and masses should be greatest in the focus area and inner portion of the support area (the part closest to the focus area), and should transition to lower heights and less mass outward from the focus area to the outer edge of the support area. Building massing should be varied to create a logical hierarchy of building forms, to break up long expanses of façade, and to create shade and shadow. Buildings at the outer edge of an activity center's support area should be comparable in height and mass with the surrounding neighborhood beyond the support area. Building heights within a neighborhood shopping zoning district or urban village zoning district should be no more than two stories. Building heights within an urban village should be no more than four stories. 
                  Cross reference— Buildings and building regulations, ch. 18. 
                  13-2.4. - Arrangement and siting of buildings. 
                  Building location, setbacks, and orientation should be carefully considered so as to increase pedestrian comfort. For example, a shaded pedestrian plaza may be created by siting buildings to maximize shade potential. Buildings in an activity center should be arranged in a manner that creates a sense of enclosure and defined space. A site's buildings should be arranged so that they help to frame and define the fronting streets, as well as the internal streets of the activity center, giving deliberate form to streets and sidewalk areas. Buildings on a site in a neighborhood shopping zoning district or urban village zoning district should be arranged so that a sufficient number of the site's buildings or portion of the site's aggregate building mass has an orientation towards the fronting street(s), and the buildings are located in relatively close relation to those fronting street(s), so as to effectively frame and define the fronting street(s) and the pedestrian accesses along those streets. 



                  As far as practicable, buildings in activity centers should not be separated from fronting streets by large parking lots. At a minimum, placement of outparcel buildings between a large parking lot and the street should be used to help define the streetscape, and lessen the visual impact of the parking lot from the street. Whenever an activity center is split across streets or quadrants of an intersection, the buildings on the different quadrants of the street should not be separated from each other by parking lots. The line and massing of the buildings and structures on each quadrant should be arranged such that they are as close to each other as possible and linked by crosswalks and pedestrian paths, so as to encourage pedestrian movement between the quadrants on opposite sides of the street(s). 
                  At a minimum, sensitive placement of outparcel buildings along the opposite sides of the street can be used to help define the streetscape, and bring development on quadrants of intersections in closer relation to each other. In such cases, the outparcel buildings should also be located in close relation to the street and to each other, and in a common alignment. Outparcels should also be connected to and served from the internal streets of the activity center or development. In activity centers, the design of outparcel buildings and sites should be integrated into the overall design of the activity center. Outparcel buildings should have architectural, design, and pedestrian connections strongly linking them with the rest of the activity center. For example, covered pedestrian walkways linking outparcel buildings with the main buildings of the center could provide a strong design connection. 
                  All buildings in the activity center should be in close physical proximity to each other, to the extent allowed by site topography, and well-connected by pedestrian sidewalks and ways as opposed to being separated from one another by large parking areas. One should not have to walk in and along parking aisles, driveways, or roadways to get from any one building to another; rather, pedestrian ways should be well defined and separated where possible from automobile access ways. 
                  13-2.5. - Compatibility. 
                  Building design and landscaping in activity centers should be compatible and harmonious with adjacent neighborhoods. In general, residential densities and non-residential intensities should be highest within activity centers, transitioning to progressively lower densities moving outwards from the focus area to the outer edge of the activity center. 
                  Adverse noise and lighting impacts from one site onto adjacent or nearby sites should be avoided, minimized, or mitigated. Design elements should be accomplished in a manner to control noise generated from service activities and mechanical equipment. Vegetated buffers and screening should be provided to ensure appropriate separations and transitions between activity centers and abutting residential neighborhoods or other lower-intensity land uses. If a development or individual building is designed to back up to residential or other site sensitive areas, significant landscaping and berms are strongly encouraged in addition to screening walls or fences to provide an adequate buffer. 
                  When fencing is provided along a property line, a decorative fencing material and architectural accents should be used which are compatible with the building façades in the activity center. Fencing that creates variety, such as staggering the fence line and incorporating wrought-iron and masonry columns, is encouraged. Screening walls should reflect the same level of architectural design as the primary structure, including landscaping to soften the wall's appearance. 
                  13-2.6. - Building appearance and architectural details. 
                  The design, architecture, materials, and colors of buildings within an activity center should be harmonious and adhere to a common design theme. Architectural designs should provide visual interest and variety, yet be consistent with the architectural character of the activity center. 
                  Buildings that are oriented towards the fronting street(s), and buildings located in relatively close relation to fronting street(s) should include architectural elements such as canopies or awnings and street-level display windows. Covered building fronts facing streets should not be permanently enclosed. Soft, flameproof awnings are encouraged over the first floors of buildings facing streets. 
                  All building elevations should be finished with the same level of architectural detail and quality. Architectural details such as texture, pattern, color, and building form used on front façade(s) should be incorporated on all visible building façades. However, such guidelines do not apply to any façade(s) facing service courts or other areas generally not visible to the public. Monotonous blank building walls should be avoided. 
                  Materials requiring low maintenance are recommended over high maintenance materials. For example, materials with integral color are generally recommended over materials that require painting. 
                  Individual corporate image architectural design elements and colors should be incorporated only as secondary elements to the development and not as the dominant element. Such corporate image elements should be consistent with and blend into the larger theme of the activity center. 
                  Ground and building-mounted mechanical equipment, such as coolers, HVAC equipment, meters, utility banks, trash receptacles, and electrical or telephone utility cabinets should be placed within interior side and rear yards or when required in front or corner side yards should be screened with landscape materials. 

                  13-2.7. - Signage. 
                  Window panes should not be painted for permanent advertising purposes, but lettering for the identification of the place of business is encouraged, provided the letters are not greater than six inches in height. Wooden signs of a small scale that hang from a projection support by chain adjacent to pedestrian ways and sidewalks are encouraged to provide a main street atmosphere. Monument signs are strongly encouraged over pole-mounted signs. 
                  13-2.8. - Parking. 
                  For any sites or developments that include significant amounts of parking, site design should avoid a "sea of parking" impression from the fronting streets (i.e., where vast amounts of surface parking dominate the view(s) from the fronting street(s) to the site's primary buildings). This design guideline is particularly applicable to shopping centers. 
                  The presence of vast parking lots between the fronting street and the buildings results in the principal buildings being set back from the roadway to such an extent that it discourages pedestrian access to the site and will frustrate any future transit connections to the site. Streetscapes that are dominated by parking lots detract from the character proposed to be created by the activity center. Single, very large parking lots should be avoided. Rather than having a single, very large contiguous parking area between the fronting street and the buildings, the parking should be broken up into smaller lots or fields of 50—100 cars by landscape strips, peninsulas, or grade separations. Generous amounts of parking should be directed to the rear and sides of the buildings or site. This guideline does not mean that there should be no parking areas between the fronting street(s) and the principal buildings in shopping centers or other large nonresidential or multifamily developments. The intent is to significantly reduce the amount of large surface parking between the fronting street(s) and the principal buildings, allowing the buildings to be brought closer to the fronting street(s), in support of a more attractive and pedestrian-friendly environment. 
                  Parking lots that face a street should be partially screened from the street by a low fence, wall, hedge, berm, or vegetated buffer. If a parking lot fronts an arterial or major collector, and is of such a size that it dominates views from the fronting arterial/collector and detracts from the overall streetscape and community appearance, then it is recommended that the parking lot be screened or buffered in its entirety from view along the fronting roadway(s). 

                  Parking aisles should be separated from one another by planted medians with shade trees. When possible, it is recommended that parking aisles and their shade trees be aligned in a solar orientation to cast shade on parked cars during the summer months, if such an orientation does not compromise other design criteria in this chapter. 
                  13-2.9. - Landscaping, trees, and natural environment. 
                  Significant landscaped and/or natural streetscapes along roadways are encouraged. Landscaping areas should be combined to form larger clusters at highly visible locations. Landscape design should create variety, interest, and view corridors for visibility. Plant materials should be placed intermittently against long expanses of building walls, fences, and other barriers to create a softening effect. Foundation planters should be provided as appropriate along front building façades. A variety of deciduous and evergreen species should be used to provide visual interest and resist disease; however, a minimum of one-third of the plantings should be evergreen coniferous species. 
                  Existing vegetation and large specimen trees should be preserved and incorporated into site design when possible, in order to create a natural appearance and the impression of a mature landscape. A sufficient number of trees, of appropriate type, should be preserved along road frontages adjacent to and within the activity center. Additional trees should be planted between curbs and sidewalks to create a tree canopy that helps to define the streetscape and that provides shade at maturity. Parking aisles should be separated from one another by planted medians with shade trees. Trees should be incorporated around the building exterior to soften the building appearance and to create a place of relief from the summer sun. 
                  Trees recommended for providing large canopy potential include but are not limited to Live Oak, Maple, Sycamore, Elm, Hickory, and Ash. Trees with a pyramidal canopy potential include Slash Pine, Red Cedar, Magnolia, Cypress, American Holly, and River Birch. Understory trees, six to eight feet in height, and that may reach a height of twenty feet at maturity include but are not limited to Dogwood, Wax Myrtle, and Crepe Myrtle. Large shrubs, four to six feet in height at time of planting, and that may reach a height of at least eight feet, include Elaeagnus, Photinia, Juniper, Holly, Viburnum, and Pampas Grass. Tree installation and removal shall be in compliance standards provided in Ordinance Number 81 of Forsyth County (Tree Preservation and Replacement Ordinance), as may be amended from time to time, and administrative standards for the preservation and replacement of trees as adopted and as may be amended from time to time. 
                  Development should generally conform to the natural terrain to the extent practical, but not at the expense of compromising other guidelines, or at the expense of precluding innovative design that would be an asset to the community, in accord with the general spirit and intent of these guidelines. 
                  Cross reference— Enviornment, ch. 34; vegetation, ch. 86. 
                  13-2.10. - Public spaces and streetscape improvements. 
                  Elements such as landscaping, street furniture, public open spaces and plazas, and amenities create contrast to and soften the built environment by making the walking experience more enjoyable and inviting. Landscape areas should be designed to form plazas, open spaces, and other focal points within the activity center. Pedestrian-oriented public outdoor spaces should be incorporated as design elements into activity centers. These public spaces may include a formal park or town green, small formal parks/plazas, and so forth, as focal points for community interaction. These public spaces should be integrated purposefully into the overall design of the activity center, and not merely be residual areas left over after buildings and parking lots are sited. These spaces should also be placed next to the areas that generate the users, such as street corners, shops and restaurants, stores, daycare, and dwellings. 
                  Within an activity center, street furniture (e.g., benches, trash receptacles), lighting, and sensitively arranged uses such as outdoor cafes should be provided to encourage human interaction and street life. Street furniture, including benches, and trash receptacles (waste bins) should be provided along streets in focus areas and preferably extended with the same architectural theme along public streets in the support areas of the activity center as well. Street furniture plans should include pedestrian walk lighting, trash receptacles (waste bins), and seating facilities for every 400 feet of walk. Advertising is not permitted on street furniture. Public telephones and water fountains are encouraged. Outdoor public art may be provided in open spaces, plazas, and along streetscapes to provide visual interest and diversity. 


                  13-2.11. - Pedestrian and bicycle access and connections. 
                  Access to developments within activity centers should serve the needs of the pedestrian and bicyclist as well as the motorist. Equal importance should be placed on accommodating and providing for pedestrian and bicycle circulation patterns. The pedestrian and bicycle paths of any one development or site within the activity center should interconnect with the pedestrian and bicycle paths of any adjacent development or site. Sidewalks should be provided along all road frontages to connect with existing or future sidewalks along the road frontages on adjacent properties. An activity center should provide for pedestrian connections into adjacent residential neighborhoods. Sidewalks should also connect buildings within the activity center to the county's open space or greenway system as may be established. All points of human activity within a development or site should be accessible to pedestrian and bicycle traffic via pedestrian/bicycle paths. Walkways should be provided between buildings in the activity center. Covered walkways are encouraged, particularly where short distances exist between buildings. 
                  Pedestrian crosswalks and bicycle crossings should be provided throughout the activity center as necessary for the safety and convenience of pedestrian travel and bicycle traffic between residential, shopping, employment, recreation, and institutional uses in the center. The number and length of pedestrian crossings through paved parking areas and drives should be kept to a minimum. Where pedestrian crossings must cross paved parking areas and drives, decorative paving material (i.e., pavers, stamped or textured concrete, or color concrete) should be used to delineate the pedestrian crossing. Ramps meeting the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements must be installed at all crossings. 
                  The travel ways for bicycle traffic should be designed to minimize automobile-bicycle travel conflict, keeping bicyclists safely out of the automotive stream. Specifically designated bicycle parking or places to store/park and lock bicycles should be provided or accommodated at points throughout an activity center's focus area and in close proximity to on-site structures and uses. Generally, activity centers should provide one bicycle parking space for every 20 vehicle parking spaces provided. 


                  13-2.12. - Transit access and connections. 
                  Activity centers should accommodate existing bus stops or include location(s) for future local transit stop(s), sited in accordance with long range county plans for transit. Transit stops should include a bus pullout bay, designed to appropriate standards of the county or transit provider. All transit stop facilities must be designed to ensure safe movement of pedestrians and the handicapped. 
                  Transit stops should be connected with the area's pedestrian/bicycle pathway system. Transit stops in an activity center should be identifiable, well lighted, and within a reasonable walk of all buildings in the activity center. Transit stops should have one or more shelters to protect users during inclement weather. Separate shelters may not be necessary if shelter design is incorporated into the building design in a manner that is suitable for waiting out of inclement weather while waiting for transit. Seating within and outside of the shelter should be provided. Landscaping around shelters, especially that which provides shading, is strongly encouraged. 
                  Street furniture, including benches, and trash receptacles (waste bins) should be provided at transit stops. Any architectural theme for street furniture should be continued and extended throughout the development, especially along the same road frontage, in order to provide the link of consistence and uniformity needed to create and expand the activity center concept. Street furniture plans should include pedestrian walk lighting, trash receptacles (waste bins), and seating facilities for every 400 feet of walk. Advertising is not permitted on street furniture or transit shelters. Phone booths and information displays showing transit routing are also encouraged. 
                  The reservation or provision of parking space for park and ride or carpool uses is encouraged within activity centers. 
                  13-2.13. - Lighting. 
                  Lighting should be used to highlight or accent architectural features and create visual interest. Exterior neon lighting, illuminated banding, or other lighting that creates a glow is strongly discouraged unless approved as part of an overall theme for the activity center. The style of lighting should reflect the architectural character of the activity center. Post top lighting fixtures and poles and decorative lamps are strongly preferred.

                  ARTICLE I. - RESTRICTED INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT (M1) 

                  14-1.1. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The purposes of these districts are to provide and reserve suitable areas for a variety of industrial uses including manufacturing, wholesale trade and distribution activities. Restricted industrial districts are only intended to be located in areas with relatively level topography, adequate water and sewerage facilities, and access to arterial streets and highways. Restricted industrial districts may be appropriate at the single lot level of development; however, restricted industrial uses are encouraged to locate in planned industrial parks and be designed in a campus-style setting. Vehicular activities in restricted industrial districts consist predominantly of trucks, with some passenger vehicle traffic, and the road system is built to support truck traffic. Provisions for pedestrians are not required, although pedestrian access to such districts is possible. 
                  The industries locating in this district are characterized as lower in intensity, cleaner, and generally more compatible when located adjacent to commercial areas than are heavy manufacturing uses. Restricted industrial districts are intended to permit only those light industrial and other uses that will not generate excessive noise, particulate matter, vibration, smoke, dust, gas, fumes, odors, radiation and other nuisance characteristics. Restricted industry is capable of operation in such a manner as to control the external effects of the manufacturing process, such as odors, vibrations, emissions, or other nuisance characteristics through prevention or mitigation devices and conduct of operations within the confines of buildings. Heavy commercial activities businesses are also included as permitted uses in these districts; however, restricted industrial districts do not service the general public and, therefore, business uses are generally not permitted. 
                  (Amd. of 9-7-2017(4)) 
                  14-1.2. - Permitted and conditional uses. 
                  As provided in Table 14.1; and subject to the following provisions which apply to all uses in this district: 
                  (a)  A conditional use is required for any establishment conducting around the clock business hours. Certain specific uses are regulated by chapter 16. 
                  (Amd. of 9-7-2017(4)) 
                  14-1.3. - Performance standards. 
                  As provided in Table 14.2. 
                  14-1.4. - Site development regulations. 
                  As provided in article IV of this chapter. 
                  ARTICLE II. - HEAVY INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT (M2) 

                  14-2.1. - Purpose and intent. 
                  Heavy industrial districts are intended to provide suitable areas for manufacturing, assembling, fabrication and processing, bulk handling, storage, warehousing and trucking. The uses associated with this district are likely to generate significant levels of truck traffic, noise, pollution, vibration, dust, fumes, odors, radiation, radioactivity, poisons, pesticides, herbicides, or other hazardous materials, fire or explosion hazards, or other undesirable conditions. Conditional uses permitted in this district are primarily those known to create a safety hazard or produce particulate matter, thus being subject to various state and/or federal environmental laws. Heavy industrial districts are highly unsuitable adjacent to residential districts and are generally unfit for the sustained activity of humans and animals. Therefore, uses involving human activity such as dwellings, care centers, and certain commercial uses are not permitted. Conditional uses require impact statements to determine their compatibility with adjacent and nearby uses. Activity at heavy industrial sites consists predominantly of trucks, rather than passenger vehicles, and the road system is built to support truck traffic. Provisions for pedestrians are not required. 
                  14-2.2. - Permitted and conditional uses. 
                  As provided in Table 14.1; and subject to the following provisions which apply to all uses in this district: 
                  (a)  A conditional use is required for any establishment conducting around the clock business hours. Certain specific uses are regulated by chapter 16. 
                  (Amd. of 9-7-2017(4)) 
                  14-2.3. - Performance standards. 
                  As provided in Table 14.2. 
                  14-2.4. - Site development regulations. 
                  As provided in article IV of this chapter. 
                  14-2.5. - Application requirements for conditional uses. 
                  In addition to the requirements for conditional uses as required by this Code, applications for a conditional use in the M2 district shall include an impact statement prepared by a qualified professional that addresses the impact of the proposed use on abutting and nearby buildings, uses, and properties. The impact statement shall address those external effects determined by the director to be likely to exist if said use is established, including but not limited to, electromagnetic interference, noise, vibration, fumes, odors, dust and air particulates, illumination, truck traffic, and water table protection. The impact statement shall recommend specific measures to mitigate such impacts and provisions for monitoring and enforcing mitigation measures, and, if approved, the recommendations of the impact statement shall be considered conditions of approval unless otherwise specified by action of the Forsyth County Board of Commissioners. At the option of the board of commissioners at the county's expense, an independent impact statement may be secured prior to its taking action on a conditional use in the M2 district to review the impact statement submitted by the applicant or to otherwise address probable adverse impacts of the proposed development; provided that an application process for a conditional use in the M2 district shall be extended no more than 62 days beyond normal processing times for the purposes of securing an independent impact statement. 
                  ARTICLE III. - MINING OPERATIONS DISTRICT (MINE) 

                  14-3.1. - Purpose and intent. 
                  These districts are specifically established to provide for the mining, extraction, crushing, and quarrying, as appropriate, of sand, rock, precious metals, and other minerals or elements removed from the earth. Mining districts allow a range of other heavy industrial uses that may be accessory to mining operations or economically linked to such uses. However, uses permitted in industrial districts should be sited in industrial districts, not the MINE district unless such uses involve extraction of materials. 
                  These districts may be suitable adjacent to agricultural zoning districts. Extensive building and operation setbacks and generous buffers are required to ensure that mining districts do not pose physical hazards or nuisances (e.g., dust, noise, vibration, etc.) to neighboring dwellings, schools, parks, places of worship, hospitals, commercial buildings, and public buildings and roads. 
                  (Amd. of 2-2-2017(3)) 
                  14-3.2. - Permitted and conditional uses. 
                  As provided in Table 14.1; and subject to the following provisions which apply to all uses in this district: 
                  (a)  A conditional use is required for any establishment conducting around the clock business hours. Certain specific uses are regulated by chapter 16. 
                  (Amd. of 9-7-2017(4)) 
                  14-3.3. - Performance standards. 
                  As provided in Table 14.2. 
                  14-3.4. - Site development regulations. 
                  As provided in article IV of this chapter. 
                  14-3.5. - Application requirements. 
                  Any application for rezoning to the MINE district must be accompanied by the following: 
                  (a)  A detailed site plan as required by the director. At a minimum, the site plan shall indicate the following: proposed location of phased mining operations; proposed locations or disposition of topsoil, overburden, and by-products, on- or off-site. 
                  (b)  A letter of intent describing the date proposed for the commencement of operations and their expected durations, including proposed hours and days of operation. Operations shall not be permitted on Sundays and holidays, nor will they be permitted within the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. on any day. Said letter shall also describe the nature of mining operations, method(s) of extraction, and equipment and materials (e.g., explosives) to be used. The letter of intent and any actions stipulated to or reasonably implied from the language of the letter of intent shall become conditions of development approval, if the rezoning application is approved. 
                  (c)  Written evidence by a geologist or other competent professional qualified to make such a judgement that the site to be rezoned MINE contains a mineral resource area or other valuable surface or subsurface substances that can be economically mined. 
                  (d)  An impact statement prepared by a qualified professional that addresses the impact of the proposed mining operation on abutting and nearby buildings, uses, and properties. The impact statement shall address those external effects determined by the director to be likely to exist if said use is established, including but not limited to as appropriate, electromagnetic interference, noise, vibration, fumes, odors, dust and air particulates, illumination, truck traffic, and water table protection. The impact statement shall recommend specific measures to mitigate such impacts and provisions for monitoring and enforcing mitigation measures, and, if approved, the recommendations of the impact statement shall be considered conditions of approval unless otherwise specified by action of the Forsyth County Board of Commissioners. At the option of the board of commissioners and at the applicant's expense, an independent impact statement may be secured prior to its taking action on a rezoning request for MINE district to review the impact statement submitted by the applicant or to otherwise address probable adverse impacts of the proposed development; provided that an application process for rezoning to MINE shall be extended no more than 62 days beyond normal processing times for the purposes of securing an independent impact statement. 
                  (e)  An operations plan and all documents submitted or prepared for submission to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources for the purpose of obtaining a state mining permit. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to update all information during the state application process and to inform the director of the final disposition of the state permit process. Operations plans, if approved, shall be considered conditions of development approval, unless otherwise specified by the director. 
                  (f)  A reclamation plan which shall include a description of how the excavated land will be restored, statement of intended future use of the land, and phasing and timing estimates of reclamation and rehabilitation activities. Reclamation plans, if approved, shall be considered conditions of development approval, unless otherwise specified by the director. The Board of Commissioners of Forsyth County may require an applicant to post a bond calculated on a specific amount per acre for the purpose of insuring proper reclamation of the land.

                  ARTICLE IV. - GENERAL SITE DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN REGULATIONS FOR INDUSTRIAL AND MINING DISTRICTS 

                  14-4.1. - Purpose and intent. 
                  It is the intent of Forsyth County to require that new industrial developments and mining operations install appropriate improvements and comply with general design regulations that are intended to improve their appearance, compatibility, and function. It is also the intent of the county to require substantial progress toward compliance with these improvement requirements and general design regulations in cases where existing industrial or mining operations are expanded. 
                  14-4.2. - Applicability. 
                  This article shall apply to all properties located within all industrial and mining zoning districts of unincorporated Forsyth County. New development shall be required to conform to these regulations. A substantial improvement of an existing development shall be required to conform to these regulations or make substantial progress toward meeting the regulations contained within this chapter. 
                  14-4.3. - Utilities. 
                  All telephone, electricity, and gas transmission lines serving uses on site shall be installed underground. 
                  14-4.4. - Grading and site development. 
                  Buildings and parking lots shall be appropriately drained so as to prevent damage to abutting properties or public streets.

                  14-4.5. - Curb cuts and access specifications. 
                  All entrances or exits of any street or driveway, public or private, from or to any state highway shall be approved by the state department of transportation and the director of engineering prior to the construction of such entrances or exits and prior to the issuance of any development permit for any improvement to be served by such entrances or exits. 
                  No curb cut or access driveway shall be permitted to be located closer than 100 feet to the nearest existing or proposed right-of-way of an intersecting roadway or closer than 40 feet to a side property line unless the adjacent property owner is in agreement with the encroachment of the driveway and approval is obtained from the director of engineering. Curb cuts or access driveways shall be no narrower than 24 feet from back of curb to back of curb. Strict adherence to these requirements may not be practical in all instances as determined by the director of engineering. The director of engineering may limit the maximum width of a curb cut and/or the number of curb cuts to a parcel as necessary when it is deemed to be of benefit to the safety and welfare of the public. 
                  In cases of a substantial improvement of an existing development on a site that does not meet these curb cut and access specifications, the applicant may be required by the director of engineering to prepare an access plan as part of plans for the substantial improvement that either meets these requirements or moves substantially toward compliance with these regulations. Approval by the Georgia Department of Transportation and the director of engineering shall be required, as applicable. 
                  Additional right-of-way shall be dedicated to the public as required by the most current functional classification of Forsyth County roads as designated in the major transportation plan.

Screening may be accomplished by a natural vegetative buffer, by a building that meets architectural standards of this chapter, by an earthen berm, by a 100 percent opaque, solid wooden fence or wall, or combination of these screening methods. The use of low-lying landscaping that does not screen the storage areas from view from the public right-of-way shall not be deemed to comply with this requirement. 
                  14-4.9. - Screening of dumpsters. 
                  All garbage dumpsters and other similar areas devoted to the storage of waste materials shall be screened on three sides of said dumpster or area with a minimum six-foot high solid wooden fence, or a wall constructed of materials substantially similar in appearance to the building on site that complies with the architectural requirements of these regulations. In addition, said dumpster areas shall be gated on the fourth side, and the gate shall be architecturally finished.

                  CHAPTER 15. - AGRICULTURAL DISTRICTS 
                  ARTICLE I. - AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT (A1) 

                  15-1.1. - Purpose and intent. 
                  Land designated as agricultural constitutes a valuable natural resource whose protection is in the public interest. The agricultural district is established to maintain those areas with land characteristics such as soil moisture, temperature and content suitable for farming (fields, pastures, farmsteads, specialty farms), dairy, livestock, forestry operations and other agricultural activities; to protect land used or needed for food production and other agricultural uses from encroachment by untimely and unplanned residential, commercial or industrial development; and to permit the continuation of agricultural uses in areas where it remains viable. 
                  The agricultural district is intended to provide for the continuation of agriculture as a viable land use and component of the local economy until market conditions and public services support conversion of agricultural land to rural or suburban residential land subdivisions and uses, or other uses. The agricultural district also helps to preserve the rural, open space character that exists in many portions of the county. Such areas are accessed only by rural roads, do not have existing public sanitary sewerage facilities, are predominantly rural in character, and consist substantially of larger unsubdivided and undeveloped tracts. 
                  15-1.2. - Permitted and conditional uses. 
                  As provided in Table 15.1; and subject to the following provisions which apply to all uses in this district: 
                  (a)  A conditional use is required for any establishment conducting around the clock business hours. Certain specific uses are regulated by chapter 16. 
                  (Amd. of 9-7-2017(3)) 
                  15-1.3. - Performance standards.

                  Editor's note— An amendment adopted July 1, 2010, repealed article II. Formerly, such article pertained to agricultural protection district (A2). Therefore, article III, §§ 15-3.1—15-3.3 was renumbered as article II, §§ 15-2.1—15-2.3. 

                  15-2.1. - Purpose and intent. 
                  Agricultural-residential districts are established to provide for rural farm or very low density, development in areas where agricultural pursuits and low-density residential uses can coexist without conflict. Agricultural-residential districts do not allow intensive agricultural uses such as hog farms and poultry houses that could have malodorous effects on residential uses. Subdivision road improvements for curb and gutter, required by chapter 18 of this Code, do not apply to properties within agricultural-residential districts.

                  (b)  All communication towers and communication antennas legally existing on February 8, 1999 shall be considered legal non-conforming uses, allowed to continue their usage as they presently exist: provided however, anything other than routine maintenance, including without limitation, structural modifications including provisions for additional antennas or additional providers and/or new construction on an existing communication tower, shall comply with the requirements of this article with the exception of separation distances. Routine maintenance shall be permitted on such existing towers. 
                  (c)  The performance and construction standards provided for in this article shall apply to all new communication tower construction including such construction that shall occur in areas zoned under the commercial tower zoning designation established by Ordinance 30J, now repealed. 
                  (d)  All government towers with public safety systems or equipment shall be exempt from the requirements of this subsection. However, private facilities and structures proposed for placement on governmentally owned property shall not be exempt. 
                  (e)  This ordinance shall not govern any tower, or the installation of any antenna, that is 35 feet or less in height and is owned and operated by a federally-licensed amateur radio station operator from the operator's residence. 
                  16-2.3. - General requirements. 
                  (a)  Principal or accessory use. A tower and/or antenna is considered a principal use if located on any lot or parcel of land as the sole or primary structure, and is considered an accessory use if located on a lot or parcel shared with a different existing primary use or existing structure. An existing use or structure on the same lot or parcel shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with zoning district requirements, including but not limited to set-back, buffer and other requirements, the dimensions of an entire lot or parcel shall control, even though the antenna or tower may be located on a leased area within such lot or parcel. Towers that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a non-conforming use or structure. 
                  (b)  Inventory of existing sites. To facilitate the co-location of antennas, each applicant seeking to locate a new tower, alternative tower structure or antenna, or to modify any such existing structure, shall provide to the department of planning and community development an inventory of existing towers or alternative tower structures. Applicants seeking to erect an amateur radio tower or antenna as defined by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations, shall be exempt from this provision. The inventory shall include all such structures that are within the jurisdiction of the governing authority; within a municipality located, in whole or in part, within Forsyth County; and within a one mile border of Forsyth County, and shall include specific information about the location (latitude and longitude coordinates), height, design, tower type and general suitability for antenna co-location of each tower, and other pertinent information as may be required by the department of planning and community development. The department of planning and community development may share such information with other applicants for a communication tower permit under this ordinance or other organizations seeking to locate towers or antennas within the jurisdiction of the governing authority, provided, however that the department of planning and community development is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable.

                  (1)  Existing towers and buildings do not technologically afford the applicant the ability to provide service to the service area of the applicant or service provider, or the cost or contractual provisions required by a tower owner to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable; and 
                  (2)  The geographical boundaries of the proposed service area cannot technologically be bifurcated to avoid the necessity for a freestanding tower/antenna; and 
                  (3)  There exists a present demand and formal commitment by wireless services providers to locate at the proposed site. 
                  16-2.5. - Zoning requirements. 
                  Communication towers and communication antennas are considered conditional uses and upon proper application and approval may be permitted in zoning districts as specified in the permitted uses tables found in the individual zoning district chapters of this Code. 
                  (Amd. of 11-15-2004) 
                  16-2.6. - Performance and construction standards. 
                  (a)  Structural design. New communication towers/antennas and modifications to existing structures including, without limitation, the addition of height, antennas or providers shall be constructed in accordance with all applicable county building codes and shall meet or exceed current standards and regulations of all applicable federal, state and local authorities. Lattice tower structures are prohibited. 
                  (b)  Setbacks. Communication tower/antenna setbacks shall be measured from the base of the tower/antenna or protruding building structure at the base of the tower, whichever is closest to the property line, to the property line of the parcel on which it is located. Communication towers/antennas and their accessory structures shall comply with the minimum lot and setback requirements of the district in which they are located. In cases where there is a conflict between the minimum lot setback and street setback requirements, the greater setback shall apply. Guy wires and support anchors are not required to meet setbacks, however they shall not extend outside of the property line and must be contained within the fenced area of the tower site. 
                  (c)  Separation from residential uses. Separation requirements for communication towers from residentially zoned lands or residential uses shall be a minimum of 500 linear feet. Communication tower separation shall be measured from the base of the tower to the closest point of off-site uses. 
                  (d)  Separation distances between communication towers. Separation distances between communication towers shall be applicable for and measured between the proposed tower and those towers that are existing and/or have received land use or building permit approval from the county. The separation distances shall be measured by drawing or following a straight line between the base of the existing tower and the proposed base, pursuant to a site plan, of the proposed tower. Minimum separation distances (listed in linear feet) shall be as follows: 
                  TABLE 16.1  SEPARATION REQUIREMENTS BY TOWER TYPES 

                   
                  (e)  Fencing. A chain link fence or wall not less than six feet in height, from finished grade equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device shall be provided around each communication tower. Access to the tower shall be through a locked gate. 
                  (f)  Landscaping. The visual impacts of a communication tower shall be mitigated by landscaping. Where adequate vegetation is not present, tower facilities shall be landscaped with a landscape buffer which effectively screens the view of the tower compound. The use of existing vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent practicable and may be used as a substitute for or in supplement towards meeting landscaping requirements. 
                  (1)  Landscape buffers shall be a minimum of ten feet in width and located outside the fenced perimeter of the tower compound; and 
                  (2)  A continuous hedge at least 30 inches high at planting and capable of growing to at least 36 inches in height within 18 months shall be planted in front of the above referenced buffer; and 
                  (3)  All landscaping shall be of the evergreen variety and shall conform with the buffer standards available for inspection at the department of planning and community development. 
                  (g)  Height. 
                  (1)  No freestanding communication tower/antenna shall exceed 200 feet in height from ground level. 
                  (2)  Where installed on top of a building, no communication tower/antenna shall extend greater than 20 percent over the building height. 
                  (3)  An existing communication tower may be modified to a taller height not to exceed 20 feet over the tower's existing height to accommodate the co-location of an additional communication antenna(s). 
                  a.  The height change referred to in this subsection may only occur one time per communication tower. 
                  b.  The additional height referred to in this subsection shall not require an additional distance separation. The communication tower premodification height shall be used to calculate such distance separations. 
                  (h)  Illumination. Communication towers/antennas shall not be artificially lighted except to assure human safety or as required by the Federal Aviation Administration. 
                  (i)  Co-location. Proposed communication antennas may and are encouraged to co-locate onto existing communication towers, provided such co-location is accomplished in a manner consistent with zoning and performance standards, new or additional conditional use approval is not required. If it is determined by the county that the proposed tower is situated in a location which will benefit the county's telecommunication systems, then the tower shall be engineered and constructed to accommodate the additional telecommunication equipment beneficial to the public system at a cost to the county no greater than the actual expense of the provider in so engineering and constructing the tower to meet the county's needs. 
                  (1)  Monopole communication towers shall be engineered and constructed to accommodate a minimum of one additional communication service provider.

                  (4)  Communication towers located within electrical substations may be engineered and constructed without accommodating additional communication service providers. Such towers shall be monopole construction and shall be subject to all of the requirements of article II, communication tower and communication antenna permits. 
                  (j)  Noninterference. No communication tower or antenna shall interfere with public safety communication. Frequency coordination is required to ensure noninterference with public safety system and/or public safety entities. 
                  (k)  Documentation. Documentation to demonstrate conformance with the requirements of performance standards shall be submitted by the applicant with all requests to construct locate or modify a communication tower/antenna. A statement by the applicant as to how construction of the communication tower will accommodate co-location of additional antennas for future users shall be included with the documentation. Documentation evidencing a present commitment from service providers to locate at the proposed site shall also be included by applicant. Documentation demonstrating proof of appropriate liability insurance shall also be provided. 
                  (l)  Signs and advertising. A small sign placed on the entrance gate of sufficient size, not to exceed four feet in total area shall display the name of the person or corporation owning the tower, the name of the person or corporation owning the property (if different from tower owner) and a current mailing address with a name and phone number of a person to contact in case of an emergency. All other signage is prohibited and the use of any portion of a tower for sign or advertising purposes including, without limitation, company name, banners, or streamers, is prohibited. 
                  (m)  Abandonment. Without waiving the county's right to determine whether or not a communication tower has been abandoned, it shall be the joint duty of both the property owner and tower owner to notify the county in writing of any intent to abandon use of the tower. Said notice shall include steps that tower and/or property owner shall take to accomplish removal of the tower structures. In the event the use of any communication tower has been discontinued for a period of 180 consecutive days, the tower shall be deemed to have been abandoned. Upon such abandonment, the owner/operator of the tower shall have an additional 180 days within which to: (1) reactivate the use of the tower or transfer the tower to another owner/operator who makes actual use of the tower; or (2) dismantle and remove the tower. The owner of the real property shall be ultimately responsible for all costs of dismantling and removal and in the event the tower is not removed within 180 days of abandonment, the county may proceed to do so and assess the costs against the real property. The lien of such assessment shall bear interest, have priority and be collectable at the same rate and in the like manner as provided for by Georgia law. At the earlier of 181 days from the date of abandonment without reactivation or upon completion of dismantling and removal, any conditional use permit, waiver and/or variance approval for the tower shall automatically expire. 
                  (n)  Finished color. Communication towers not requiring FAA painting/marking shall have either galvanized finish or be painted a non-contrasting blue, gray or black finish. The color should be selected so as to minimize the equipment's visibility. 
                  (o)  Liability insurance. Liability insurance in an amount not less than $1,000,000.00 shall be maintained by the owner and operator of the facility until such facility is dismantled and removed from the parent site. Failure to maintain insurance coverage shall constitute a violation of this Code and grounds for revocation of conditional use approval. Proof of same shall be supplied to the department of planning and community development upon application. 
                  (p)  Fees. 
                  (1)  The fees for conditional use approval for a communication tower/antenna shall be the same as rezoning fees for the CBD category. 
                  (2)  The development permit fees shall be the same as for any commercial development. 
                  (3)  The building permit fees shall be set at $200.00 and shall cover the tower and associated equipment building. Any other permits required shall be charged at the prescribed rate at the time of development or construction. 
                  (4)  As with any conditional use or special exception application, the applicant shall be required to submit additional amounts as deemed sufficient and appropriate by the county in order to obtain any needed technological expertise so as to assist county staff in evaluation the request.

                  16-3.1. - Classification of home businesses. 
                  A home business may be classified as "professional home office" or "home occupation" based on the specific characteristics of and activities associated with said home business. A "professional home office" is more restricted than a "home occupation" as detailed below; with one principle distinguishing characteristic being that a professional home office does not permit nonresidential employees and on-site customers. The determination as to whether a home business is classified as a "professional home office" or "home occupation" shall be made by the director as set forth herein. 
                  (a)  Professional home offices. Professional home offices are businesses that, by their nature, appearance and inherent operational activities and characteristics, are less intensive in character and activity and are, therefore, less likely to have a noticeable and negative impact on the residential or agricultural character of the subject property and surrounding neighborhood. Due to the less intensive nature of these activities, applications for professional home office need only be reviewed by staff for administrative approval and more than one professional home office per residence may be granted. A professional home office shall comply with all of the following performance criteria and general requirements set forth in this article: 
                  (1)  Activities associated with a professional home office shall be conducted entirely within residential dwelling (including an attached garage, or, one detached garage when no attached garage exists; and 
                  (2)  The display, storage or parking of materials, goods, supplies, or equipment outside of the dwelling or within an accessory building (excluding an attached garage) is prohibited; except as may be permitted in the agricultural zoning districts as provided for in chapter 17, section 6.4; and 
                  (3)  There shall be no nonresident employees working upon the residential property for which a professional home office permit license has been granted; and 
                  (4)  There shall be only two customers on the premises; and 
                  (5)  No more than one vehicle, used primarily as a passenger vehicle, shall be permitted in connection with the professional home office. Trucks with three or more axels, including those with one axel in the front and two in the rear, tractor trailers, heavy equipment, etc. are not allowed except as may be permitted in the agricultural zoning districts as provided for in chapter 17, section 6.4.; and 
                  (6)  The use of exterior signage is prohibited; 
                  (b)  Home occupations. Home occupations are businesses that, by their nature, appearance and inherent operational activities and characteristics, are potentially more intensive in character and activity and are, therefore, more likely to have a noticeable and negative impact on the residential or agricultural character of the subject and surrounding properties. Due to the more intensive nature of these activities, only one home occupation is allowed per residence. Home occupations shall comply with all of the following performance criteria and general requirements set forth in this article: 
                  (1)  Unless otherwise specifically approved by the planning commission, all activities associated with a home occupation shall be conducted entirely within the residential dwelling and/or in an enclosed accessory building or structure, provided said building meets all the requirements of this Code; and 
                  (2)  The display, storage or parking of materials, goods, supplies, or equipment outside of the dwelling is permitted in an enclosed accessory building except as may be permitted in the agricultural zoning districts as provided for in chapter 17 section 6.4; and 
                  (3)  The number of part or full-time non-resident employees working upon the premises for which a home occupation permit license has been granted shall not exceed three employees; and 
                  (4)  There shall only be only two customers on the premises at any given time; and 
                  (5)  There shall be no retail sales of goods not made on the premises; and 
                  (6)  No more than two vehicles, used primarily as passenger vehicles, shall be permitted in connection with the home occupation. Trucks with three or more axels, including those with one axle in front and two in rear, tractor trailers, heavy equipment, etc. are not allowed except as may be permitted in the Agricultural zoning districts as provided for in chapter 17, section 6.4; and 
                  (7)  Exterior signs shall be limited to one sign not greater than two square feet in area and flush-mounted to the residential dwelling 
                  (c)  Prohibited home business. 
                  (1)  Any type of repair or assembly of vehicles or equipment with internal combustion engines or of large appliances or any other work related to automotive parts is prohibited. 
                  (2)  Group instruction, assembly or activity is prohibited. 
                  (3)  Call centers, and dispatch centers. 
                  (4)  Special events facilities, to include outdoor commercial recreation. 
                  (5)  Lodging services. 
                  (6)  Private clubs. 
                  (d)  Home occupations in agricultural zoning districts. All home occupation applications in agricultural zoning districts shall require a public hearing before the planning commission, except if the following conditions are satisfied then staff approval shall be authorized: 
                  (1)  Minimum lot area. The parcel shall be a minimum of five acres in size and zoned agricultural (A1) or agricultural-residential (AG-RES). 
                  (2)  Hours. Hours of operation shall be limited between the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., seven days a week.

Noncompliance with any applicable requirement and/or regulations may be grounds for denial or revocation of a home occupation or professional home office application. 
                  (b)  The owner/proprietor of a home business shall be responsible for notifying the director of any changes to the conduct, nature or scope of the home business that render the business different from that included in the description provided as part of the application, or from any conditions or restrictions imposed as part of the license. Such changes may result in the discontinuation of the use, or the need for a new application and reclassification of the home occupation or professional home office. 
                  (c)  The home business shall be conducted from the owner's/proprietor's principle domicile or permanent home. 
                  (d)  Activities associated with a home business shall not generate any solid or liquid waste, water consumption, traffic, noise, vibrations, smoke, dust, odor, heat, glare, disturbance or interference with the provision of electrical, television or other utility services, or create any safety hazards exceeding those which are typically and customarily produced by and/or associated with a residential dwelling and residential uses in the zoning district and surrounding neighborhood within which the subject property and home business is located. Light spillage restrictions as outlined in section 16-4.20 shall be met and maintained. The total area used to conduct activities associated with a home business should not exceed 33 percent of the finished space within the principal building. For purposes of this calculation, finished space within the principal building shall exclude unheated areas such as porches, unfinished basements, garages and decks. 
                  (1)  All licensed owners/proprietors of home businesses that verifiably existed on or before November 22, 1999 that are nonconforming with the area requirements specified in this article, shall be exempt from these requirements.

                  (e)  The residential dwelling, accessory buildings and structures, and overall property shall remain residential in character and appearance that are typical and customary for residential property located in the zoning district within which the home business is located. Structural and other alterations and alterations in the exterior or interior appearance that will make the dwelling, buildings, and/or the site appear or function similar to a commercial operation are prohibited. Prohibited alterations may include, but are not limited to, the creation of a separate or exclusive entrance(s) for business purposes, use of signage or other advertising other than that allowed as set forth herein and commercial-like exterior lighting. 
                  (f)  All parking shall be located in an off-street location on a paved, gravel or other suitable parking surface. Parking on lawn areas is prohibited. 
                  (g)  Wholesale or retail sales from within a residential dwelling, accessory building or structure, or from a residential property on a regular or year-round basis or as a primary activity or function of the home occupation or professional home office shall be prohibited except for sales conducted entirely via the mail, telephone or internet. No goods or products intended for sale shall be displayed outside of a dwelling, accessory building or structure, or elsewhere on the property. This provision is not intended to limit or prohibit the sale of agricultural products grown from the same agricultural property. In addition, year-round retail sales comprising the primary business activity of a home occupation shall be permitted on agriculturally zoned parcels (A1) when approved by the planning commission. 
                  (h)  Truck deliveries or pick-ups of supplies or products associated with a home business shall be limited to the type of vehicles and pick-up/delivery hours that are typical and customary for residential dwellings and uses located in the zoning district within which the home business is located. Specifically, these vehicles shall be limited to the types of vehicles associated with the delivery of domestic mail and packages. 
                  (i)  In order to ensure that a home business does not become a nuisance to the surrounding properties and property owners, the director, or planning commission may impose reasonable conditions as deemed necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of said properties, property owners and general public. 
                  (j)  Owners/proprietors of a home occupation shall permit a limited inspection of the premises by the director or other duly authorized agent of the board of commissioners or other agency having jurisdiction or responsibility for enforcing applicable laws, requirements, and regulations at the time of application or after the home occupation has commenced operation in order to determine compliance with the requirements of this Code and/or the conditions of the license. Failure to cooperate in providing such access may result in the immediate discontinuation of the home occupation or professional home office license. 
                  (k)  Owners/proprietors of all home businesses shall maintain a valid business license. Failure to hold a valid business license will invalidate the home occupation or professional home office. 
                  (l)  All home occupation and professional home office licenses shall be deemed valid for an initial twelve-month period unless otherwise provided for as a condition of the approval. After the initial twelve-month period, all home occupation and professional home office permits shall expire on the first day of April. The director may revoke a home occupation and professional home office license if any of the following circumstances occur: 
                  (1)  Changes occur in the activities or character of the home occupation or professional home office being conducted that warrant additional review and approval by the director, or planning commission; 
                  (2)  Whenever the director has reasonable cause to believe that any of the general or specific requirements and/or performance criteria set forth in the Code, or conditions imposed as part of the professional home office or home occupation are being or have been violated, or, any activity associated with conduct of the home occupation or professional home business becomes hazardous, harmful, noxious, offensive or a nuisance to the surrounding neighborhood and properties. 
                  (m)  If the director does revoke a home occupation or professional home office license, the director's decision may be appealed to the ZBA. 
                  (n)  The granting of a home occupation or professional home office license shall not constitute a covenant running with the property from which such home business is being conducted.

                  16-4.10. - Demolition of historic structures. 
                  (a)  Forsyth County has more than 400 properties that have been documented in the county's historic resources survey. Preservation and maintenance of historic structures contribute to the cultural heritage of the county and are therefore in the long-term interest of the county. It is the intent of this section to provide an opportunity for preservation, but not to preclude demolition of historic structures. 
                  (b)  Applications for land disturbance on sites containing a historical structure and that propose the demolition of structures shall be reviewed by the director. In cases where a building or structure proposed for demolition is documented in the county's historic resources survey, the following procedures shall apply: 
                  (1)  An automatic 60-day delay on action regarding the demolition of the historic structure shall be invoked by the director to determine the significance of the historic building or structure and to allow time for the director to educate the property owner on potential rehabilitation programs and benefits as well as development options for preserving the building or structure. The automatic 60-day delay on demolition of historic buildings and structures shall not apply to buildings or structures deemed by the director as in immediate danger to the health, safety, or welfare of the occupants, the owner, or the general public. During the 60-day delay period, the director may issue the applicant's land disturbance permit so long as measures satisfactory to the director have been taken to protect the historic building or structure from harm. 
                  (2)  The director may complete, or request from the historic sites division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources or another agency or professional person with expertise in historic preservation, an investigation of the historical or cultural value of the building or structure proposed for demolition. The desirability, economic feasibility, historical value, current condition, costs of restoration or repair, prospects for relocation to another site, and integration into development plans shall be considered in such an investigation. 
                  (3)  The director shall present the results of the investigation to the property owner within forty-five days. The property owner shall have until the expiration of the 60-day delay period to consider options for the historic building or structure and to choose his or her option, which may include rehabilitation, relocation to another part of the site, arrangement for the sale or donation and relocation of the building or structure to another site, integration of the structure into development plans, or demolition of the structure. The director shall respect the decision of the property owner and issue the permit for demolition, as originally requested, if that is the choice of the property owner. The director shall keep a record of the disposition of historic buildings and structures for future updates to the historic resources survey of the county.

                  Drive through facilities in neighborhood shopping (NS) districts are conditional uses because by their very nature they cater to the automobile and therefore detract from the pedestrian orientation of neighborhood activity centers. Drive-through facilities for fast food establishments and staffed bank teller facilities shall not be permitted in NS districts. In cases where conditionally permitted in NS or UV districts, drive-through facilities shall not be located within 50 feet of public rights-of-way or within 50 feet of a residential or office residential zoning district. Stacking lanes for drive-through facilities, where permitted, must be designed in a manner so that vehicle queuing does not interfere with access driveways, interparcel connections, or maneuverability in and out of off-street parking spaces. Stacking lanes shall be clearly identified through the use of striping, landscaping, and/or signs, and stacking lanes for fast-food establishments shall provide a means for vehicles to escape from the drive-through queuing stream.

                  ARTICLE I. - PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY 

                  17-1.1. - Purpose and intent. 
                  (a)  Establish requirements for minimum off-street parking and loading areas in proportion to the need created by each use; 
                  (b)  To reduce congestion in the streets and to ensure that uses and functions of public rights-of-ways are not interrupted; 
                  (c)  Establish certain maximum as well as minimum requirements for parking spaces to reduce development costs and ensure that excess impervious surfaces are not constructed, while providing for additional parking spaces additions when a demonstrated need exists; 
                  (d)  To promote flexible approaches to the provision of off-street parking, including in some cases, as appropriate, use of on-street parking, shared parking arrangements, smaller spaces for compact cars, and unimproved overflow or spillover parking areas. 
                  (e)  To encourage the provision of bicycle parking and park and ride facilities, where warranted. 
                  (f)  To establish design and improvement specifications for the development of parking lots, access aisles, parking decks, and connections of parking lots and decks to public streets. 
                  (g)  To ensure that parking areas will be compatible with abutting residential districts. 
                  17-1.2. - Applicability. 
                  This chapter shall apply to any new building constructed; for new uses or conversions of existing, conforming buildings; and for enlargements of existing structures. In addition, this chapter shall apply to any development providing five or more off-street parking spaces. This chapter shall not be construed as to require additional parking spaces to be furnished for an existing building which is repaired, altered, maintained, or modernized, where no significant structural alterations are made and the size of the building is not increased; provided, however, that when the occupancy of any building is changed to another use, parking shall be provided to meet the requirements of this chapter for the new use. 
                  ARTICLE II. - REQUIRED PARKING 

                  17-2.1. - Required minimum number of parking spaces. 
                  No existing facility used for off-street parking shall be reduced in capacity to less than the minimum required number of spaces, or altered in design or function to less than the minimum standards, unless specifically provided for in this chapter. Buildings, structures, and uses shall meet the following: 
                  TABLE 17.1  MINIMUM NUMBER OF OFF-STREET PARKING SPACES REQUIRED 

                   
                  (Amd. of 6-2-2011; Amd. of 2-7-2013; Amd. of 12-1-2016; Amd. of 12-20-2016; Amd. of 2-2-2017(4); Amd. of 9-7-2017(5)) 
                  17-2.2. - Interpretations of parking requirements. 
                  (a)  Fractions. Where a fractional space results during the calculation of required parking, the required number of parking spaces shall be construed to be the next highest whole number. 
                  (b)  Parking space requirement not specified. Where the parking requirement for a particular use is not described in this chapter, and where no similar use is listed, the director shall determine the number of spaces to be provided based on requirements for similar uses, location of the proposed use, the number of employees on the largest shift, and the expected demand and traffic generated by the proposed use. 
                  (c)  Required parking for multiple uses. When a building includes a combination of uses, the required number of parking spaces shall be the sum of the required parking for each use, when the multiple uses operate simultaneously. For non-simultaneous use, the parking requirements for the use requiring the greater number of parking spaces will govern. 
                  17-2.3. - Reduction of required parking for off-site arrangements. 
                  Off site parking may be used in combination to meet minimum parking space requirements; a reduction of required off-street parking spaces on a given site may be permitted by the director in cases where additional off-street, off-site, parking area of sufficient quantity and in conformity with this chapter compensates for the reduction, subject to the following: 
                  (a)  The property is under one ownership, or a valid agreement exists between the two property owners for use of the parking area; 
                  (b)  Off-site parking shall not exceed 50 percent of the required parking for a building or buildings. 
                  (c)  Off-site parking shall be located within 800 feet of the building or buildings in which it is leased to serve. 
                  (d)  Lease agreements, as applicable, must be of sufficient duration to serve the use or uses proposed to be partially served by the off-site leased parking. 
                  (e)  Safe and convenient pedestrian access, such as a sidewalk or path, must exist or be provided from the structure or use to the off-site parking lot. 
                  17-2.4. - Reduction of required parking for mixed or joint use of parking spaces. 
                  The director may authorize a reduction in the total number of required off-street parking spaces for two or more uses jointly providing parking facilities when their respective hours of need of maximum parking do not normally overlap, provided that the developer submits sufficient data to demonstrate that the hours of maximum demand for parking at the respective uses do not normally overlap. 
                  17-2.5. - Reduction of required parking for alternative transportation arrangements. 
                  The director may in individual cases administratively authorize a reduction in the minimum number of parking spaces for projects that are directly served by public transit and for projects that provide bicycle parking, provided that it can be shown that such available alternative travel modes will reduce the overall need for parking on the site proportional to the requested reduction in parking spaces. 
                  17-2.6. - Reduction of required parking when on-street parking is permitted. 
                  The director may in individual cases administratively authorize a reduction in the minimum number of parking spaces for projects that are directly served by on-street parking approved by the director of engineering. 
                  17-2.7. - Parking maximums. 
                  To avoid excessive surpluses which increase development costs and impervious surfaces, parking shall not be provided in quantities greater than 25 percent above the required minimum; provided, however, the following: 
                  (a)  The director may allow parking at a rate in excess of 25 percent above the required number of spaces, on a case-by-case basis based upon the scale and impacts of the request, for good cause shown. The applicant shall make said request in writing which shall include documentation from an acceptable industry publication (e.g., Institute of Transportation Engineers, Urban Land Institute, American Planning Association, etc.) or by a study prepared by a traffic engineering firm that documents parking requirements. 
                  (b)  The director may allow a land area for parking that exceeds 25 percent above the required number of spaces to be designed and reserved for future parking use. In such a case, said reserved parking area shall not be developed except by written permission from the director, upon demonstration by the applicant that existing parking spaces are occupied at a rate of 90 percent or higher for 25 percent or more of the regular business hours in which the business or use operates during a non-holiday week. 
                  17-2.8. - Parking space and isle specifications. 
                  (a)  Space size. An off-street parking space shall be a minimum of nine feet in width and 18 feet in length. 
                  (b)  Compact parking. Compact auto parking spaces, shall be not less than eight feet wide by 17 feet long and may be used in commercial parking uses when more than 20 parking spaces are required, provided the area is clearly marked and not more than 20 percent of the entire parking area is designated compact auto parking. 
                  (c)  Ninety-degree angled parking. For a single row of 90-degree head-in parking, the minimum depth for a parking space plus the width of the aisle shall be 42 feet. For two rows of 90-degree head-in parking using the same aisle, the minimum depth for parking spaces plus the width of the aisle shall be 60 feet. 
                  (d)  Forty-five-degree angled parking. For a single row of 45-degree head-in parking the minimum width of parking space plus aisle shall be 31 feet. For two rows of 45-degree head-in parking using the same aisle, the minimum width for parking space plus aisle shall be 50 feet. 
                  (e)  Thirty-degree angled parking. For a single row of 30-degree head-in parking the minimum width for a parking space plus aisle shall be 29 feet. For two rows of 30-degree head-in parking using the same aisle, the minimum width for parking spaces plus aisle shall be 45 feet. 
                  (f)  Parallel parking. A single row of parking spaces may be provided parallel to an aisle, provided they are at least 22 feet in length and eight feet in width. 
                  (g)  Driveway direction. Driveways less than 20 feet in width, if provided, shall be marked and limited to traffic flow in one direction only.

                  17-3.1. - Loading areas required for specified uses. 
                  On the same lot with every building, structure or part thereof, erected or occupied for manufacturing storage, warehouse, truck freight terminal, department store, wholesale store, market, hotel, motel, or extended stay hotel or motel, hospital, mortuary, dry cleaning plant, retail business or other uses similarly involving the receipt or distribution of vehicles, materials or merchandise, there shall be provided and maintained adequate space for the standing, loading and unloading of such materials to avoid undue interference with public use of streets and alleys. 
                  (Amd. of 9-7-2017(5)) 
                  17-3.2. - Loading area specifications. 
                  Unless otherwise approved by the director, loading spaces shall be a minimum of 14 feet wide, 60 feet long, with 14 feet of height clearance. Said loading area shall be located to the rear of the building unless site design precludes a rear location, in which case loading shall be to the side of a building. 
                  17-3.3. - Minimum number of off-street loading spaces required. 
                  One off-street loading space shall be provided for the first 10,000 square feet of gross floor area or fractional part thereof for light industrial use and one off-street loading space for the first 5,000 square feet of gross floor area or fractional part thereof for retail or other non-industrial use for which a loading space is required. One additional space shall be required for each additional 25,000 square feet of gross floor area or fractional part thereof for light industrial use and for each additional 10,000 square feet of gross floor area or fractional part thereof for retail or other non-industrial use. 
                  ARTICLE IV. - GENERAL PARKING AND LOADING AREA SPECIFICATIONS 

                  17-4.1. - Location of parking and loading areas.

                  18-1.5. - Exemptions from plat approval. 
                  The following types of land divisions, transfers, and sales are specifically exempted from the plat approval requirements of this chapter; provided, however, that such exemptions shall not apply to land development requirements of this chapter, and such exemptions shall not require the county to issue permits should the resulting lots or parcels not meet applicable requirements of this Code.

                  ARTICLE II. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

                  18-2.1. - Land is one tract until subdivided. 
                  Until property proposed for subdivision has received plat approval and been properly recorded, the land involving the subdivision shall be considered as one tract. 
                  (Amd. of 2-2-2004; Amd. of 11-11-2012) 
                  18-2.2. - Lot combinations. 
                  An existing lot line forming the boundary between two lots located within the same subdivision may be removed or eliminated through the plat revision process which conforms to the requirements of this chapter. The combining of lots that are not located in the same subdivision is prohibited, except that lots that were formerly in different subdivisions may be combined where applicable covenants have expired either by their own terms or by application of law, provided that the proposed lot combination between lots in such different subdivisions is approved by the board of commissioners in compliance with the sketch plat approval procedures at UDC 8-5.3(d), irrespective of the acreage involved. In the case no plat applies to the subject lots or parcels, a boundary survey and plat depicting all lots involved in the lot combination shall be required to be approved by the director and recorded. Such combination plat shall be titled with the same name as that of the original subdivision and shall indicate thereon that the replat is for the purpose of removing the lot lines between specific lots. For purposes of this paragraph only, the term subdivision shall have the meaning set forth in chapter 3 but shall also mean lots that are encumbered by effective, valid and enforceable covenants. 
                  (Amd. of 2-2-2004; Amd. of 11-11-2012; Ord. of 10-6-2016(1), § 1) 
                  18-2.3. - Boundary line adjustments. 
                  One or more existing lot lines forming boundaries between platted lots located within the same subdivision, or one or more lot lines between abutting lots or parcels may be adjusted through a final plat revision process that requires the approval of the director and recording of a plat meeting the specifications of a final plat. In the case no final plat applies to the subject lots or parcels, a boundary survey and plat of the entire lots involved in the boundary line adjustment shall be required to be approved by the director and recorded. Such plat showing said boundary line adjustment shall be titled with the same name as that of the original subdivision and shall include thereon that the replat is for the purpose of adjusting the lot lines between specific lots. 
                  (Amd. of 2-2-2004; Amd. of 11-11-2012) 
                  18-2.4. - Access requirements. 
                  (a)  Minimum access standards. All lots and tracts hereafter created must front a minimum of 60 feet on a county, city, or state approved public road, with the exception of cul-de-sac lots, which must front a minimum of 20 feet on a county approved public road. In the event property is a landlocked lot, as of the effective date of this Code, the property owner shall acquire a minimum 20-foot easement to a state, city, or county-maintained road, and said easement shall be duly recorded and made a part of the property deed. No building permit shall be issued for any lot that does not meet the minimum access standards of this section, except as otherwise specifically permitted, until such time as there exists a road or street meeting all county standards. 
                  (b)  Plats straddling jurisdictional boundaries. Whenever access to the subdivision is required across land within the jurisdictional boundaries of another local government, the planning commission may request assurance from the local government authority that access is legally established, and from the local government engineer that the access road is adequately improved, or that a guarantee has been duly executed and is sufficient in amount to assure the construction of the access road. In general, lot lines should be laid out so as not to cross jurisdictional boundary lines. 
                  (c)  Additional rights-of-way. Subdivisions that adjoin existing streets shall dedicate additional right-of-way to meet the minimum street width requirements specified by the county's major transportation plan, and the entire right-of-way shall be provided where any part of the subdivision is on both sides of the street; provided that when the subdivision is located on one side of an existing street, one-half of the required right-of-way, measured from the center line of the existing roadway, shall be provided.

                  ARTICLE III. - STREETS AND DEDICATIONS IN MAJOR SUBDIVISIONS 

                  18-3.1. - Requirements for streets. 
                  (a)  Public streets required. Access to every lot in a major subdivision shall be provided over a public street, whether it is privately maintained or maintained by the county. Construction of a privately maintained road requires prior approval by the board and must be constructed to current county standards. All streets and other features in the major transportation plan of Forsyth County, Georgia, shall be platted by the subdivider in the locations and to the dimensions indicated in the major transportation plan adopted by the board of commissioners. 
                  (b)  Street alignment, intersections and jogs. Streets shall be aligned to join with planned or existing streets. Under normal conditions, streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. Street jogs with center-line offsets of less than 150 feet shall not be permitted. 
                  (c)  Continuation of existing streets and connections. Existing streets shall be continued as the same or greater width, but in no case less than the required width. The planning commission or board of commissioners may require that a major subdivision provide one or more future connections to adjoining subdivisions or unsubdivided tracts. 
                  (d)  Street plans for future phases of the tract. Where the plat proposed to be subdivided includes only part of the tract owned or intended for development by the subdivider, a tentative plan of a future street system for the portion not slated for immediate subdivision consideration shall be prepared and submitted by the subdivider. 
                  (e)  Marginal access streets. Whenever the proposed subdivision contains or is adjacent to the right-of-way of a U.S. or state highway, a marginal access street approximately parallel and adjacent to such right-of-way may be required at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of land between such street and right-of-way. 
                  (f)  Alleys and service access. Alleys may be provided. If they are provided, they must be paved. The pavement width of an alley must be no wider than 20 feet. Dead-end alleys shall be avoided were possible; but if unavoidable, they shall be provided with adequate turn-around facilities. Service access shall be provided in commercial and industrial districts for off-street loading, unloading, and parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed. 
                  (g)  Street and subdivision names. Street and subdivision names require prior approval by the county. Street and subdivision names shall not be approved that will duplicate or be confused with names of existing streets and subdivisions in the county. 
                  (h)  Block length. Intersecting streets shall be provided at such intervals so as to provide adequate cross traffic. Blocks in residential subdivisions should not exceed 1,800 feet nor be less than 600 feet in length, except where topography or other conditions justify a departure from these standards. In blocks longer than 800 feet, pedestrian ways and/or easements through the block may be required by the planning commission near the center of blocks. 
                  (i)  Block width. The width of the block shall normally be sufficient to allow two tiers of lots of appropriate depth. Blocks intended for business or industrial use shall be of such width as to be considered most suitable for their respective use, including adequate space for off-street parking and deliveries. 
                  (j)  Street entrances. All street entrances to major subdivisions must be landscaped per plans submitted to and approved by the Forsyth County Department of Planning and Community Development. The proposed location of street entrance monuments, if provided, must be shown on the final plat and approved by the county. Street entrance monuments must be setback ten feet from the right-of-way or out of the clear zone for the main road, whichever is greater. Required landscaping must be in place prior to the approval of a final plat; provided, however, that the director may allow the planting of landscaping to be delayed by one season, when there exists adverse seasonal weather conditions, subject to the posting of a landscape bond in a form approved by the director.

                  18-3.2. - Dedications, generally. 
                  Subdivision streets and rights-of-way and other lands to be dedicated to the public shall be accepted by the county only upon the delivery to the board of commissioners of the general warranty deed conveying fee simple title of such right-of-ways and lands. The warranty deed shall be accompanied by an attorney's certificate of title and a tax transfer form addressed to the Forsyth County Board of Commissioners certifying that the grantor in such deed is vested with marketable fee simple title to the property conveyed thereby, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, and further that the individual executing such deed has full authority to do so. Acceptance of such dedication shall be accomplished by resolution of the board of commissioners, a certified copy of which resolution shall be attached to both the deed of dedication and the final plat.

                  ARTICLE IV. - DESIGN REQUIREMENTS FOR LOTS 
                  This article shall apply to major and minor subdivisions, unless specifically indicated otherwise. 

                  18-4.1. - Adequate buildable area required. 
                  Land subject to flooding, improper drainage or erosion, or that is unsuitable for residential use for topographical or other reasons, shall not be platted for residential use nor for any other use that will continue or increase the danger to health, safety, or of property destruction, unless the hazards can be and are corrected. Each lot shall contain an adequate building site not subject to flooding and outside the limits of any existing easements or setbacks required by this Code. 
                  (Amd. of 2-2-2004; Amd. of 11-11-2012) 
                  18-4.2. - Lot remnants shall not be permitted. 
                  All remnants of lots below minimum size left over after subdividing of a larger tract must be added to adjacent lots, rather than allowed to remain as unusable parcels. The director of planning and community development may permit a lot remnant for a specific purpose such as a detention pond, provided that access and design is appropriate and the lot remnant is restricted to specific non-building use. 
                  (Amd. of 2-2-2004; Amd. of 12-1-2011) 
                  18-4.3. - Service areas. 
                  Commercial and industrial lots shall be adequate to provide service areas and off-street parking suitable to the use intended. 
                  (Amd. of 2-2-2004) 
                  18-4.4. - Lot area. 
                  The minimum lot area shall not be less than that established by the zoning district in which the subdivision is located. 
                  (Amd. of 2-2-2004) 
                  18-4.5. - Lot width. 
                  No portion of a lot shall be narrower than 60 feet, with the exception of cul-de-sac lots and lots on the inside of curves whose side property lines are perpendicular or radial to the road. 
                  (Amd. of 2-2-2004) 
                  18-4.6. - Side lot lines. 
                  Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines. 
                  (Amd. of 2-2-2004) 
                  18-4.7. - Corner lots. 
                  For purposes of determining the front setback on residential corner lots, the lot line with less street frontage than the other may be considered the front. This designation only applies if the lot line considered the front has adequate width to meet the front setback requirements. In cases where the two property lines with street frontage measure exactly the same and neither lot line measures less frontage, then the applicant may designate on the plat either one as the front, provided that front setback requirements are met. In no case shall the applicant be required to designate both lines as the front. 
                  (Amd. of 2-2-2004; Amd. of 11-1-2007; Amd. of 11-11-2012) 
                  18-4.8. - Lot depth. 
                  Residential lots shall have a depth of not less than 100 feet, unless circumstances make these limitations impracticable. 
                  (Amd. of 2-2-2004) 
                  18-4.9. - Double frontage lots. 
                  Double frontage and reverse frontage lots should be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from arterials or overcome specific disadvantages of topography or orientation. A ten-foot no access easement shall be required along one of the frontages. 
                  (Amd. of 2-2-2004; Amd. of 11-15-2004) 
                  18-4.10. - Locations adjacent to major street. 
                  Where a subdivision borders a freeway, a major arterial, or any other major source of noise, the subdivision should be designed to reduce noise in residential lots to a reasonable level via a landscaped buffer area or lots with greater depth from the major street to enable increased setbacks from the street. Double frontage lots with frontage on a major arterial shall have additional depth in order to allow space for screen planting along the lot line abutting a major arterial. The director may require a ten-foot no access easement for double frontage lots for the section of a lot abutting the major arterial. 
                  (Amd. of 2-2-2004; Amd. of 11-15-2004; Amd. of 11-11-2012) 
                  18-4.11. - Drainage. 
                  Where the subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, channel or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater or drainage easement of adequate width as determined by the director of engineering and as set forth in section 18-5.15. Drainage shall also be designed in accord with Ordinance No. 75 (Stormwater Management Ordinance), the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual and the Forsyth County Addendum that provides the county with the authority to manage drainage. If there exists a conflict between this paragraph and Forsyth County's Stormwater Management Regulations, the stricter stormwater requirement shall control. Parallel streets may be required by the planning commission in connection therewith. 
                  (Amd. of 2-2-2004; Amd. of 11-1-2007)

                  18-5.18. - Sewage system. 
                  The sewage disposal options available to each subdivision and land development shall be limited to: (a) public sewer; (b) existing private sewage treatment plant with sufficient capacity; or (c) private on-site sewage disposal systems. In every instance where public sewer is available it shall be the sole sewage disposal option, and each house, building or property used for human occupancy, employment or other purposes shall be required to connect to and utilize public sewer. The availability of public sewer shall be deemed to exist when any portion of the development is within 5,000 feet of a public sewer line and the public sewer line can accommodate the anticipated effluent load. The 5,000 feet requirement applies to development that is within 5,000 feet of an existing sewer line or sewer line under construction when measured along the gravity route from the property line. The 5,000 feet requirement does not apply to existing developments on septic where the existing septic system is adequate for the expanded or remodeled facility or home. The installations necessary for sewage disposal shall be installed by and at the expense of the sub-divider, land developer, or lot purchaser, in conformity with the requirements of the Forsyth County Health Department and existing policies, regulations, standards and ordinances approved by the board of commissioners. 
                  (a)  Exemptions. An exemption to the public sewer connection requirement may be granted if a development meets certain criteria as defined in this section. 
                  (1)  For residential subdivisions composed of 25 lots or less or stand-alone single houses, a variance can be granted by the director of water and sewer when the gravity flow distance exceeds 200 feet per residential lot or unit measured from the property line. 
                  (2)  For all non-residential development, a variance can be granted by the director of water and sewer when the distance exceeds 200 feet per residential equivalent. One residential equivalent is equal to 270 gallons of sewer capacity. 
                  (3)  Additional requirements. 
                  a.  An entire property will be evaluated for potential development needs and shall not be allowed to subdivide into smaller units to avoid extending to sewer. 
                  b.  Any development granted a variance shall note in its' covenants that sewer connection will be required if and when gravity sewer is established within 200 feet of the property per the Forsyth County Health Department's ruling and all costs, including tap fees, to make the connection, will be at the property owner's expense. 
                  c.  Any proposed development consisting of more than one house or business that is granted a variance shall install "dry" sewer within the development to provide future service to each lot or potential customer connection. The "dry" sewer will be installed in the streets, or in other locations approved by the department of water and sewer. Each potential service connection will be served by a six-inch lateral. The sewer will extend to the downstream portion of the development, and terminate at a location and invert elevation to be approved by the director of water and sewer. All sewer infrastructure will be installed and tested in accordance with Forsyth County specifications. 
                  (4)  Who considers variances. Variances under this section shall be reviewed as provided in section 8-3.2 of this Code. 
                  (5)  Criteria to consider for variance applicants. The applicant for any sewer variance shall provide written justification as to why the standard sewer or waste disposal options present a hardship. The zoning board of appeals, planning commission, and/or board of commissioners as the case may be shall make a decision on each sewer variance based on the following criteria. 
                  a.  The feasibility of utilization of private on-site sewage management systems; 
                  b.  The financial feasibility of a public sewer facility at the proposed location; 
                  c.  The proximity to the subdivision or development to existing private sewer treatment plant or public sewer; 
                  d.  The estimated period of time before public sewer will become available to the subdivision or development, in accord with the Forsyth County Master Sewer Plan; 
                  e.  Whether a public sewer facility at the proposed location would be incompatible with Forsyth County's Master Sewer Plan; 
                  f.  The anticipated additional demand and/or burden on existing infrastructure (i.e., roads, schools, fire services, etc.) that will be generated by the proposed subdivision or development; 
                  g.  Whether a public sewer facility at the proposed location would assist Forsyth County in achieving those water reuse and return objectives established by pertinent state and local regulatory authorities; 
                  h.  Whether the sewer variance, if granted, will be detrimental to the public safety, health, or welfare of the public or injurious to other property; 
                  i.  Whether the conditions upon which the sewer variance request is based are unique to the subdivision or development for which the relief is sought and are not applicable generally to other subdivisions or developments; and 
                  j.  Whether, because of the particular location, physical surroundings, environmental considerations, archaeological or historical considerations, shape, size, or topographical conditions of the specific subdivision or development involved, an extraordinary hardship, environmental or health hazard, or practical difficulty would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if available sewer options are utilized. 
                  (6)  Variance decision. A variance application submitted as part of a rezoning request shall be considered and decided coterminous with the rezoning application. A variance application not submitted as part of a rezoning request shall have a decision rendered within 180 days from the date the application is submitted. If no decision is forthcoming within 180 days, then the sewer variance shall be deemed granted, per the application. 
                  (7)  Review of variance decisions. Review of variance decisions under this section shall be conducted consistent with chapter 8, article VIII of this Code. 
                  (b)  Granting of a sewer variance. In the event a sewer variance is granted, the applicant and county representatives shall promptly meet and develop plans for a collaborative sewer collection, treatment and disposal system which shall be built in accordance with Forsyth County design specifications, and titled, owned and operated by Forsyth County or its designee. As part of this collaborative effort, the county and the applicant shall meet and formulate a strategy for the (1) financing of the sewer plant, if applicable, (2) remuneration of sewer financing expenses to the applicant, if applicable, (3) capacity allocations, (4) competitive bid criteria, (5) time-line for commencement of construction, (6) permitting issues, and (7) any other matters necessary and pertinent to the construction and financing of the public sewer. Adherence to Forsyth County design specifications with respect to the public sewer facility shall not be a negotiable item. 
                  (1)  Disputed terms. If, after good faith attempts are exhausted, the county and the applicant are unable to reach resolution on any or all of the terms of a collaborative agreement to construct a public sewer facility, a three-member panel shall be assembled to consider and resolve disputed terms. The county and the applicant shall jointly prepare a statement indicating those terms that are agreed upon and those terms that are disputed. This statement shall be provided to the panel. More than one panel may be assembled if the disputed terms encompass multiple subject areas requiring panels with varied expertise. 
                  (2)  Panel membership. One member of the panel shall be a qualified professional chosen by the applicant; one member of the panel shall be a qualified professional chosen by the county. The third member shall be a qualified professional chosen by both the county and applicant-appointed panel members. The panel shall consider the variance application, documentation on file as part of the variance process, and the joint statement by the county and applicant, and shall issue a decision resolving the disputed terms within 30 days of assembly. A majority of the panel must resolve disputed issues. The decision of a panel shall be final. 
                  (3)  Contract formation. Upon receipt of the panel(s)' decision, the county and the applicant shall enter into an agreement for the construction of a public sewer facility incorporating the terms mutually agreed upon and/or as resolved by the panel. This contract shall be subject to approval by the Forsyth County Board of Commissioners, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 
                  (4)  Withdrawal. At any time prior to execution of the contract identified above, the applicant shall be permitted to withdraw the request for a collaborative public sewer agreement. In the event of withdrawal, no party may make a renewed sewer variance request involving the same property for a period of one year. 
                  (5)  Appeal. In lieu of withdrawal, an applicant may, within 30 days of a panel decision, appeal to the superior court to determine whether the panel decision was the product of (1) corruption, fraud or misconduct, (2) an overstepping by the panel of their authority or such imperfect execution of it that a final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made; or (3) a manifest disregard of the law.

                  18-6.2. - Sketch plat. 
                  Sketch plat purpose, requirements and procedures are addressed in chapter 8 of this Code. 


                  (Amd. F of 5-12-2003; Amd. of 2-2-2004; Amd. of 11-15-2004; Amd. of 11-1-2007) 
                  18-6.3. - Construction plans. 
                  (a)  Application. Upon approval of a sketch plat, the subdivider or land developer may apply for construction plans approval. In the case of a minor subdivision, or in cases where a sketch plat is not required by this article, the subdivider or land developer may apply for approval of construction plans; provided, however, that in the case of a minor subdivision or land development the applicant for construction plan approval should hold a pre-application conference with the department to ensure that plans meet the intent and specific provisions of this Code. The construction plan approval process is administrative. Applications for construction plan approval shall be made in accordance with requirements shown in Table 18.1 and 18.2. No application for a construction plan shall be accepted for processing or approved by the director until a sketch plat, if required, has been approved and the proposed construction plans are found by the director to substantially conform with said approval and any conditions of such approval. 
                  (b)  Director's decision criteria. The only basis upon which the director may deny a construction plan is the failure of the application to meet the requirements of this Code or any other applicable Forsyth County Ordinance or the failure of the construction plans and application to meet the requirements of sketch plat approval specified by the planning commission. 
                  (c)  Certificate of approval. All copies of the construction plans shall be noted by inscription on the plat as follows: 
                  "Pursuant to the Unified Development Code of Forsyth County, Georgia, and all requirements of approval having been fulfilled, these construction plans have been given approval by all Reviewing Departments, with final approval by the Director, or a designee of the Planning and Development Department, the issuing authority for Forsyth County. Construction plan approval does not constitute approval of a final plat, if required, and does not entitle this plat and plans to recordation in the Clerk's Office, Forsyth County Superior Court. The certificate of construction plan approval shall expire and be null and void one year from the date of the Planning and Development Department approval stamp as found on the cover sheet of these plans." 
                  (d)  Certificate expiration. The planning and community development department stamp of approval on construction plans shall certify that the plans are approved, but such stamp shall not constitute approval of a final plat, if required. In the case of a subdivision, it indicates only the layout has been approved as a guide to the preparation of final plat, and that improvements are authorized to be constructed. Construction plan approval shall expire and be null and void one year from the date of planning and community development department approval stamp as found on the cover sheet of said plans, unless activity toward improvement upon the land has been initiated, or unless an extension of time is approved by the department.

                  18-6.4. - Final plat. 
                  (a)  When required. All major and minor subdivisions shall require final plat approval. The final plat approval process is administrative. Applications shall be made in accordance with requirements shown in Table 18.1. 
                  (b)  Criteria for approval. The director of planning and community development may grant final plat approval if the following conditions are met: 
                  (1)  A sketch plat of the proposed subdivision has been previously officially approved by the county when required. 
                  (2)  Construction plans have been approved by the director. 
                  (3)  All improvements have been installed and inspected by the director of engineering, or adequate provisions have been made to guarantee such improvements. The Forsyth County and/or City of Cumming Water and Sewer Department must approve utility construction prior to the approval of the final plat. 
                  (4)  The final plat meets all applicable requirements of this Code. 
                  (5)  A complete final plat application has been submitted, including all supporting materials required by this chapter for final plats. 
                  (6)  If a final plat has not been approved within one year of initial submittal, the application for final plat approval is null and void. The final plat must be resubmitted and the applicant must pay a resubmittal fee. 
                  (7)  In residential developments, any amenities area must be permitted and under construction before the issuance of a final plat. 
                  Final plats and applications that meet the above-referenced conditions shall be considered a ministerial action of approval by the director of planning and community development. Denial of a final plat shall be permitted only upon specific findings that one or more of the above-referenced conditions have not been met. 
                  (c)  Approval certificate. Upon approval of the final plat, a certificate, stamped directly on the plat, shall state: 
                  "Pursuant to the Unified Development Code of Forsyth County, Georgia, and all requirements of approval having been fulfilled, this final plat was given approval by all Reviewing Departments, with final approval by the Director, or a designee of the Planning and Development Department, the issuing authority for Forsyth County. This final plat is entitled to recordation in the Clerk's Office, Forsyth County Superior Court, on or after the date as indicated on the Planning and Development Department approval stamp as found on the cover sheet of these plans." 
                  (d)  Additional plat specifications. Per those requirements identified in Table 18.1 and 18.2 to be supplied on a final plat, each major subdivision final plat - and all minor subdivision plats when deemed necessary by the county engineer - shall contain certificates in the following form: 
                  (1)  Surveyor's certificate. A certificate by a surveyor directly on the applicable plat as follows: 
                  "It is hereby certified that all monuments and improvements shown hereon actually exist except as otherwise indicated and that their location, size, type and material are correctly shown. 
                  By: _____ 
                  Registered Georgia Land Surveyor No.: _____ " 
                  (2)  Owner's certificate. A certificate by the owner directly on the applicable plat, signed in an appropriate manner as follows: 
                  "The owner certifies that all state and local taxes and other assessments that have been billed for collection by the pertinent taxing authority have been paid. The owner donates and dedicates to the public for use forever the public street right-of-way as shown on this plat.

                  ARTICLE VII. - SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISIONS FOR MINOR SUBDIVISIONS 
                  Notwithstanding other provision of this chapter, minor subdivisions shall be governed by the following: 

                  18-7.1. - Flag lots. 
                  Flag lots within minor subdivisions shall be permitted, provided that flag lots within a minor subdivision shall meet the minimum access requirements as specified by this Code. At no point may the staff or "pole" portion of a flag lot be less than 60 feet in width. Minor subdivisions may contain more than one flag lot, however flag lots may not adjoin each other or share common property lines. This provision shall not be construed to prohibit the approval of two contiguous flag lots in separate minor subdivisions under separate ownership. Under no circumstances may two flag staffs or "poles" be contiguous. 
                  (Amd. of 3-26-2001; Amd. of 2-2-2004) 
                  18-7.2. - Access. 
                  A maximum of three lots within a minor subdivision may fail to abut a public road or street only in an instance where the subdivider provides access to said individual lot over and across a valid easement containing a minimum width of 20 feet. The location and dimensions of such access shall be shown upon the minor subdivision plat and clearly identified as an easement and shall only be used for a maximum of three parcels, whether previously platted or newly created under the terms of this chapter. In instances where a minor subdivision contains such lots that do not abut a public road, the final plat of the minor subdivision shall also contain the following owner's certificate: 
                  "I, the undersigned owner hereby dedicate the access easement shown on this plat to the common use of the owner, or owners, of the lot within this subdivision. It is further acknowledged that the accessway and any improvements within such access easement shall not be accepted by Forsyth County, Georgia, but shall remain privately owned and maintained.

                  18-7.3. - Limitations on minor subdivisions. 
                  (a)  Purpose. Minor subdivisions provide certain advantages that tend to favor their use over the filing of major subdivision applications. Said advantages include a shorter application period and approval process, less public scrutiny, and less rigorous requirements for access to three of the lots in a minor subdivision. Given these advantages, the prospect exists that subdividers may seek to divide a parcel via consecutive and/or contiguous minor subdivisions instead of filing for a major subdivision. It is the intent of the board of commissioners to prohibit the practice of "chain" subdivisions where the same land owner subdivides land and then files minor subdivision applications on contiguous common parcels, which collectively total seven or more lots. It is also the intent of the board of commissioners to prohibit minor subdivisions adjacent to each other within a three-year time period, in cases where part of an original tract of land is now owned by another person or entity and was transferred or sold to another owner with the apparent intent to circumvent the major subdivision process. 
                  (b)  Contiguous common parcels, as defined by this Code, shall be referenced on all applications for minor subdivisions and contiguous common parcels shall be considered part of any application for minor subdivision, for purposes of determining whether or not the division of land proposed is a major subdivision or a minor subdivision. Contiguous common parcels shall not be counted as lots in the case of a minor subdivision. 
                  (c)  Land within a minor subdivision, including all contiguous parcels owned by the subdivider, shall not be further divided for a period of three years unless a sketch plat application is filed and approved as a major subdivision pursuant to the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (d)  If property proposed to be subdivided was part of an original tract, and if the property proposed to be subdivided abuts land that has been divided as a minor subdivision in the last three years, then minor subdivision of said property shall be prohibited. This provision shall not be construed to prohibit the approval of two contiguous minor subdivisions under separate ownership; however, this provision is intended to be construed liberally so that one property owner does not develop a minor subdivision on part of an original tract and transfer or sell another part of the original tract for the purposes of minor subdivision within a three year period. It is the intent that land abutting a minor subdivision that was owned by the subdivider of the abutting minor subdivision shall not be subdivided as a minor subdivision for a period of three years, regardless of ownership.

                  ARTICLE VIII. - INTRAFAMILY LAND TRANSFERS 

                  18-8.1. - Eligibility. 
                  A land subdivision shall qualify as an intrafamily subdivision plat if it meets the following requirements: 
                  (a)  Each and every conveyance of a tract or parcel of land contained within the subdivision plan shall be an intra-family transfer to the children or the spouse and children of the grantor or surviving heirs of deceased children of the grantor.

                  (c)  The provisions of this article shall be available only for minor subdivisions. 
                  (d)  The provisions of this article shall apply only to simultaneous transfers of tracts or parcels of land and all platted parcels shall be immediately transferred with recording of the deeds simultaneously with the final subdivision plat. 
                  (e)  The proposed subdivision must meet all requirements of this Code. 
                  (f)  No grantee shall receive more than one approved parcel. 
                  (Amd. of 2-2-2004) 
                  18-8.2. - Plat and procedural requirements. 
                  To be eligible for approval, the following requirements shall be met: 
                  (a)  The proposed subdivision must contain only lots which are one acre or greater in area, unless a variance is obtained. 
                  (b)  Each subdivided parcel shall be substantially equal in area as topography permits. 
                  (c)  A plat of the proposed subdivision shall be presented for approval to the planning commission. 
                  (d)  An easement for ingress and egress, minimum 60 feet wide at all points, shall be shown on the plat running from a public road maintained by the State of Georgia, the Political Subdivision of Forsyth County or the City of Cumming to each divided tract or parcel. If such easement runs across lands of persons other than those owned by the proposed grantor(s), reference must be given on the subdivision plat to the place of recording of the deed granting the 60-foot easement across the property of such other person(s). The easement shall be owned by the grantees in fee simple as tenants in common. 
                  (e)  The plat must contain thereon a notation as follows: 
                  "The easement shown on this plat is for the exclusive use of the approved lots ____________ shown. No other property shall be allowed to use the easement for ingress and egress until the easement meets County standards and is accepted by the governing authority. The approved lots shall not be further subdivided until such acceptance or upon the grant of variance pursuant to regulations. The property owner(s) shall be required to bring said easement and the travel way within the easement up to County standards prior to the dedication of the right-of-way and acceptance of maintenance by the County." 
                  (f)  The name of each grantee shall be shown on each tract created. 
                  (g)  The 60-foot easement shall traverse the tracts or parcels to be conveyed contiguous to the boundaries thereof and shall not divide a single tract or parcel. 
                  (h)  All deeds, affidavits, and costs for recording shall be submitted to the planning and community development department at the same time the final plat is presented for approval. 
                  (i)  The platted easement shall be cleared of trees and brush for safety purposes along the centerline thereof to a minimum width of 30 feet with an installed traveled surface in the center of such 30-foot strip, such installed traveled surface to be graded to a minimum width of 22 feet with adequate drainage provided to prevent flooding of the roadbed. All tracts or parcels shall use this right-of-way for ingress and egress to the publicly maintained road. 
                  (j)  The 60-foot easement shall show two ten-foot wide strips within such right-of-way and contiguous to the boundaries thereof within which all utility installations serving the parcels shall be placed. 
                  (k)  The subdivision plat shall contain thereon, in addition to other notations required by this chapter for final plats, a notation that "no warranty deed, quit-claim deed, executor's or administrator's deed or assent to devise, or other transfer of any interest in the property shall be executed or recorded transferring any tract or parcel, or portions thereof, unless such division has been specifically approved by the planning commission. 
                  (l)  An affidavit, signed by all grantors and grantees in a form approved by the county attorney, stating that no consideration for the transfer of the properties shall pass other than love and affection, shall be filed with the department of planning and community development.

                  ARTICLE IX. - PRIVATE STREETS 

                  18-9.1. - Private streets permitted. 
                  Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter (section 18-2.4(a) and section 18-3.1(a)), private streets may upon application be permitted by the board of commissioners within major subdivisions, subject to the requirements of this article. Applications for approval of private streets shall be considered by the board of commissioners. The board of commissioners may impose conditions on the approval of private streets to ensure the health, safety and welfare of the general public and to mitigate potential problems with private streets. 
                  Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter (section 18-2.4(a) and section 18-3.1(a)), a private street may be permitted as part of a subdivision containing six or fewer lots on lands zoned A1 and LR, without the specific approval of the board of commissioners, as a major subdivision, subject to the requirements of this article; provided, however, that no more than six lots shall be served by any individual private street pursuant to this provision. 
                  A private streets shall not be permitted or approved pursuant to this article when it is proposed in a location shown on the county's official map as a future public street or on the County's major thoroughfare plan as a public street.

                  18-9.2. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to construct a new private street or alter an existing private street or to cause the same to be done without first obtaining a land disturbance permit for such construction or alteration from the department. 
                  (b)  It shall be unlawful for more than six lots to be served by a private street, except as may be specifically approved by the board of commissioners as provided in section 18-9.1. 
                  (c)  All private streets shall be constructed to all standards for public streets as required by this Code, construction specifications of the county engineering department, and the director of engineering. No land disturbance permit for a private street shall be issued unless the proposed street is in conformity with county standards and requirements for public streets and the provisions of this Code. 
                  (d)  No final plat involving a private street shall be approved unless said final plat conforms to the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (e)  All provisions of this chapter regarding public streets, including the design, submittal of plans, required improvements, etc., shall apply to all private streets approved pursuant to this article.

                  18-9.3. - Street names and easements for private streets. 
                  Private streets shall be named. The subdivider of land involving a public street shall install street signs with content containing the street name and the designation "private," as approved by the director of engineering. Easements for private streets shall be designated on final plats as general purpose public access and utility easements, along with the name of said private street. Said easement shall at minimum be of the same width as that required for the right-of-way of a public street by the major thoroughfare plan and the director of engineering for the type of public street (local, collector, etc.) most closely resembling the proposed private street. Easements for private streets shall not be included in any calculation of minimum lot size or density limitations established by this Code. In the cases of private streets serving six lots or less, the general purpose public access and utility easement for the private street shall be shown in a manner on the final plat such that each lot fronting the private street extends to the centerline of the private street. No lot shall be permitted to be divided by the general purpose public access and utility easement required and established for a private street. In the cases of private streets serving seven or more lots, the general purpose public access and utility easement for a private street shall be drawn as its own discrete parcel to be dedicated to a private homeowners association (i.e., not shown to be a part of any lot).

                  18-9.4. - Maintenance. 
                  The county shall not maintain, repair, resurface, rebuild, or otherwise improve streets, signs, drainage improvements or any other appurtenances within general purpose public access and utility easements established for private streets. A private maintenance covenant recorded with the County Clerk of the Superior Court shall be required for any private street and other improvements within general purpose public access and utility easements established for private streets. The covenant shall set out the distribution of expenses, remedies for non-compliance with the terms of the agreement, rights to the use of easements, and other pertinent considerations. The covenant shall specifically include the following terms: 
                  (a)  The covenant shall establish minimum annual assessments in an amount adequate to defray costs of ordinary maintenance and procedures for approval of additional needed assessments. The covenant shall also specify that the funds from such assessments will be held by a homeowners or property owners association in cases of a subdivision fronting on a private street. 
                  (b)  The covenant shall include a periodic maintenance schedule. 
                  (c)  The covenant for maintenance shall be enforceable by any property owner served by the private street. 
                  (d)  The covenant shall establish a formula for assessing maintenance and repair costs equitably to property owners served by the private street. 
                  (e)  The covenant shall run with the land. 
                  (f)  The board of commissioners may, at its discretion, as a condition of approving private streets, require a performance bond and/or maintenance bond be submitted by the subdivider and held by a homeowners or property owners association, or the board may require that the subdivider pay an amount of money as recommended by the director of engineering into an escrow account or other suitable account for the maintenance and repair of private streets and stormwater management improvements, to be drawn from by the homeowners or property owners association as maintenance and repair needs may arise. 
                  (g)  The subdivider/developer shall provide to the county an acceptable form of financial security to guarantee the repair and maintenance of public water and sewerage improvements and utilities, including, but not limited to water lines, sewer lines, pump stations, force mains, and lift stations. The subdivider's or developer's financial guarantee, whichever is applicable, may be any of the following on a form required by or acceptable to the county: (1) An escrow of funds with the county; or (2) A maintenance bond for the benefit of the county upon which the county can collect. The financial guarantee shall be in an amount to secure the full costs, as determined by the director of water and sewer, of maintaining and repairing said improvements and utilities for a period ending upon the later of the county's issuance of a release letter regarding the bond or 18 months after recording of the county approved final plat for the subdivision, or subdivision phase, as the case may be. The previous sentence notwithstanding, in no event will the financial guarantee extend for longer than 36 months. To the extent no release letter has been issued by the county within 36 months of the guarantee being issued, the guarantee shall be deemed to automatically expire at the expiration of the 36-month.

                  18-10.1. - Buffer protection requirements. 
                  All undisturbed buffers (whether exterior buffers or stream buffers or any other designation) shall be identified with orange, four-foot tree-save fencing prior land-disturbance. Tree-save fencing shall remain in place until issuance of certificate of occupancy or certificate of completion. 
                  (Added 11-1-2007) 
                  18-10.2. - Augmentation. 
                  All buffers are required to be undisturbed, except as provided below. Undisturbed buffers shall be augmented, however, with plantings in order to satisfy requirements of the Forsyth County Buffer Standards if sparsely vegetated. 
                  (Added 11-1-2007) 
                  18-10.3. - Prohibited encroachments. 
                  Prohibited buffer encroachments include, but are not limited to, buildings, pavement, parking, service areas, detention ponds, roads, septic tanks, septic drain fields, and walls, unless otherwise specified in section 18-11. A buffer may be disturbed for approved access and utility crossings including, but not limited to, water and sewer lines, drainage pipes, and gas lines provided that it does so via a perpendicular crossing that does not run parallel within the buffer. An exception to a perpendicular crossing restriction may be requested for side and rear buffers. If a required buffer cannot provide a visually impervious screen, it shall be supplemented with additional plantings as specified in the Forsyth County Buffer Standards. Specific buffer types are defined below. 
                  (Added 11-1-2007 Amd. of 11-11-2012) 
                  18-10.4. - Buffer measurement. 
                  The specified width of a buffer is measured as extending along the entire portion of the common property line and from the common property line extending into the interior of the subject parcel. 
                  (Added 11-1-2007) 
                  18-10.5. - Buffer controls by type. 
                  The following regulations are found in various chapters of this Code, including Chapter 10 General Provisions, Chapter 16 Supplementary Regulations and Chapters 11, 12, 14 regulating Zoning Districts. For convenience, these regulations are itemized here. 
                  (A)  Residential Exterior. The exterior buffer required by Chapter 11 for some residential developments may be disturbed for grading and/or development of a site. 
                  (B)  Georgia Highway 400 - Limited Access (Fulton County to SR 369 right-of-way). The required buffer shall meet the requirements of the Forsyth County Buffer standards to achieve a visual screen. 
                  (C)  Large Scale Retail. The buffer required along property lines abutting residential, agricultural or OR zoning district shall remain undisturbed. 
                  (D)  Stream Buffer. See Section 18-11. 
                  (E)  Side and rear yard zoning district requirements. The buffer required along property lines abutting residential, agricultural or OR zoning districts may disturbed and replanted when site conditions dictate, as documented by the engineer of record and as permitted by the director of planning and/or engineering. Specifically, such disturbance may occur only in instances where erosion control issues, stormwater management methods (excluding structural stormwater control practices), topography, and/or the installation of water and sewer lines require clearing and/or grading. In regards to utility crossings, in instances where the line must run parallel within the buffer, compliance with the Forsyth County Buffer Standards must be met; said easement cannot reduce the minimum planting requirement or width of the required buffer. All disturbed buffers must comprise of one extra row of plantings in addition to the minimum requirements as indicated in the Forsyth County Buffer Standards prior to final site approval.

                  ARTICLE XI. - STREAM BUFFER REGULATIONS 

                  18-11.1. - Applicability. 
                  The provisions of this article shall apply to all land development activity on property containing state waters as defined in chapter 3 of this Unified Development Code. These requirements are in addition to, and do not supersede, any applicable buffer requirements established under state law, and approval under or exemption from the requirements of this article does not constitute approval under or exemption from buffer requirements established under state law or from other applicable local, state or federal regulations. 
                  (a)  The requirements of this article shall not apply to the following activities: 
                  (1)  Work consisting of the repair or maintenance of any lawful use of land that is zoned and approved for such use on or before the effective date of this article. 
                  (2)  Existing agriculture, silviculture, landscaping, gardening and lawn maintenance. 
                  (3)  Any land development activity that is under construction, permitted for development, or has been submitted for approval as of the effective date of this article. 
                  (4)  Multi-phased land-disturbance activities. With respect to the applicability of this article, a grace period shall exist for multi-phased developments (whether for office parks, master-planned communities or otherwise identified multi-phase developments) for which any of the following exist prior to the effective date of this article: 
                  a.  Initial phases have already been permitted; or 
                  b.  A site plan had been approved through the sketch plat process showing an alternate stream buffer; or 
                  c.  An approval for zoning included conditioning the property to a specific site-plan, provided that the approval date preceded November 14, 2004. 
                  For such developments, discrete phases that have not been submitted for permit approval as of the effective date of this article shall be allowed two years to do so and shall be allowed to utilize the previous stream requirements identified on their site plans or zoning condition. Permit applications submitted more than two years after the effective date of this article, however, shall meet the buffer and setback requirements herein. 
                  (b)  Exemptions. The following specific activities are exempt from this article. Exemption of these activities does not constitute an exemption for any other activity proposed on a property. 
                  (1)  Activities for the purpose of building the following: 
                  a.  A stream crossing by a driveway, transportation route or utility line; 
                  b.  Water and sewer utility lines and pumping stations, provided that the director of water and sewer determines that the buffer is the best location for such facilities; 
                  c.  Public water supply intake or public wastewater outfall structures; 
                  d.  Intrusions necessary to provide access to a property; 
                  e.  Public access facilities that must be on the water including boat ramps, docks, foot trails leading directly to the river, fishing platforms and overlooks; 
                  f.  Unpaved foot trails and paths; any paths or trails constructed and maintained by the county, and; any paths that connect to a county trail system, subject to approval by the county engineer. 
                  g.  Activities to restore and enhance stream bank stability, vegetation, water quality and/or aquatic habitat, so long as native vegetation and bioengineering techniques are used. 
                  h.  Water features designed specifically for stormwater best management practices, as determined by the director of engineering. 
                  (2)  Public sewer line easements paralleling the creek, except that all easements (permanent and construction) and land disturbance should be at least 25 feet from the top of the bank. This includes such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including but not limited to manholes, vents and valve structures. This exemption shall not be construed as allowing the construction of roads, bike paths or other transportation routes in such easements, regardless of paving material, except for access for the uses specifically cited in (1) above. 
                  (3)  Authorized land development activities within a right-of-way. 
                  (4)  Within an easement of any utility existing at the time this article takes effect or approved under the terms of this Unified Development Code, land disturbance activities and such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including but not limited to manholes, vents and valve structures. 
                  (5)  Emergency work necessary to preserve life or property. However, when emergency work is performed under this section, the person performing it shall report such work to the department of engineering on the next business day after commencement of the work. Within five days thereafter, the person shall apply for a permit and perform such work within such time period as may be determined by the department of engineering to be reasonably necessary to correct any impairment such emergency work may have caused to the water conveyance capacity, stability or water quality of the protection area. 
                  (6)  Forestry and silviculture activities on land that is zoned for forestry, silvicultural or agricultural uses and are not incidental to other land development activity. If such activity results in land disturbance in the buffer that would otherwise be prohibited, then no other land disturbing activity other than normal forest management practices will be allowed on the entire property for three years after the end of the activities that intruded on the buffer. 
                  (Added 11-1-2007) 
                  18-11.2. - Stream buffer requirements. 
                  All land development activity subject to this article shall meet the following requirements: 
                  (a)  An undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained for 50 feet, measured horizontally, on both banks (as applicable) of state waters as measured from the top of the bank. 
                  (b)  An additional setback shall be maintained for 25 feet, measured horizontally, beyond the undisturbed natural vegetative buffer, wherein all impervious cover shall be prohibited, except for stormwater management facilities. Grading, filling and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback; allowance for such activity shall consider needs for retaining walls and other topographical requirements as determined by the department of engineering. 
                  (c)  No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer. 
                  (d)  Additional permit application requirements for developments on properties that contain state waters. Any permit application for property requiring buffers and setbacks hereunder must include the following: 
                  (1)  A site plan showing: 
                  a.  The location of all state waters on the property; 
                  b.  Limits of required buffers and setbacks on the property; 
                  c.  Buffer zone topography with contour lines at no greater than five-foot contour intervals; 
                  d.  Delineation of forested and open areas in the buffer zone; and 
                  e.  Detailed plans of all proposed land development in the buffer and of all proposed impervious cover within the setback, including documentation establishing a properly approved variance or qualifying exemption that would permit land disturbing activity within a buffer or setback; 
                  (2)  A written description of any proposed land development within the buffer and setback; and 
                  (3)  Any other documentation that the director of planning and community development or director of engineering may reasonably deem necessary for review of the application and to insure that the buffer zone regulation is addressed in the approval process. All buffer and setback areas must be recorded on the plat, final plat, or as-built of the property following plan approval. 
                  (Added 11-1-2007; Amd. of 12-1-2011) 
                  18-11.3. - Administration of stream buffer requirements. 
                  (a)  Variance procedures. Variances from the above buffer and setback requirements may be granted in accordance with the following provisions: 
                  (1)  Who considers variances. Variances under this section shall be reviewed as provided in chapter 8 of this Code and apply to those requested in conjunction with zoning application requests. 
                  (2)  Public hearing. All applications for a stream buffer variance shall require a public hearing and notice as specified in the applicable provisions of chapter 8 of this Code. 
                  (3)  Variances will be considered only in the following cases: 
                  a.  When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of this article prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted. 
                  b.  Unusual circumstances wherein strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in this article would create an extraordinary hardship, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience. 
                  Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this article, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property. 
                  (4)  At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information: 
                  a.  A site plan that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey; 
                  b.  A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
                  c.  A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated; 
                  d.  Documentation of the extraordinary hardship should the buffer be maintained; 
                  e.  At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible; 
                  f.  A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion; 
                  g.  A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and 
                  h.  A buffer mitigation plan in accordance with the stream buffer mitigation checklist. Forsyth County acknowledges the beneficial functions of undisturbed stream buffers including: water quality protection, pollutant/runoff infiltration, maintenance of base flow water levels, erosion/sedimentation reduction, increased channel/bank stability, stream shading, support of aquatic and terrestrial wildlife habitats, and recreational/aesthetic value. To compensate for the lost stream buffer functions due to impacts, mitigation should revegetate, protect, and otherwise maintain and improve stream buffer functioning at the same site where the impact will occur. 
                  (5)  Incomplete applications which fail to include the above information shall not be considered. 
                  (6)  The department of engineering shall prepare and submit to the board considering the variance (zoning board of appeals, planning commission and/or board of commissioners) a technical comment on the applicant's mitigation measures, alternative designs and/or explanations of why an alternative plan is not possible. 
                  (7)  The following criteria will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance: 
                  a.  The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
                  b.  The locations of all state waters and on the property, including along property boundaries; 
                  c.  The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; 
                  d.  Whether request is the minimum necessary to accomplish the proposed development and whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion; 
                  e.  The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance; 
                  f.  Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment. 
                  (b)  Responsibility. Neither the issuance of a development permit nor compliance with the conditions thereof, nor with the provisions of this article shall relieve any person from any responsibility otherwise imposed by law for damage to persons or property; nor shall the issuance of any permit hereunder serve to impose any liability upon Forsyth County, its officers or employees, for injury or damage to persons or property. 
                  (c)  Validity. Approvals are valid per section 8-6.4(c) of this Code. 
                  (d)  Review of variance decisions. Applicants may petition the board of commissioners regarding variance decisions per chapter 8, article VIII of this Code. 
                  (e)  Inspection. The director of engineering may cause inspections of the work in the buffer or setback to be made periodically during the course thereof and shall make a final inspection following completion of the work. The permittee shall assist the director of engineering in making such inspections. Forsyth County shall have the authority to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out its duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable time upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigating and inspecting the sites of any land development activities within the protection area. No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent who requests entry for purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out official duties. 
                  (f)  Violations, enforcement and penalties. Any violation of the provisions of this article or the requirements of an approved site plan or permit may be subject to the enforcement actions detailed in chapter 22 of the UDC or Ordinance No. 73 (Soil and Sedimentation Control Ordinance), section VII, whichever shall result in the greater potential penalty to the offender. Any such action or inaction which is continuous with respect to time is deemed to be a public nuisance and may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief.

                  ARTICLE I. - PURPOSE AND INTENT 
                  This chapter is intended to provide for residential subdivisions that are designed based first and foremost on the provision and preservation of open space, but that accommodate the entire amount of development that would otherwise be legally possible under conventional subdivision designs, and that: 
                  (a)  Minimize the environmental and visual impacts of new development on critical resources and historically and culturally significant sites and structures. 
                  (b)  Contribute to an interconnected network of permanent open space in the county. 
                  (c)  Provide for undivided open spaces within new developments. 
                  (d)  Create more attractive and pleasing living environments. 
                  (e)  Reduce the demand on public expenditures for open space, parkland, play fields, and other areas for active and passive recreation. 
                  (f)  Meet design requirements and guidelines established in this chapter for the protection of conservation areas.

                  ARTICLE II. - APPLICABILITY OF CHAPTER 18 AND CHAPTER 11 TO CONSERVATION SUBDIVISIONS 
                  It is the intent of this chapter to create and preserve open space and to provide alternative standards for the development of land to those specified in chapter 18, subdivisions and land development and those specified in chapter 11, residential districts. Provisions of chapter 18 and chapter 11 that are specifically addressed in this chapter shall not apply. However, in cases where the provisions for conservation subdivisions do not address a particular question or issue, the provisions of chapter 18 and chapter 11 shall apply.

                  ARTICLE III. - CONSERVATION AREAS AND OPEN SPACES 

                  19-3.1. - Primary conservation areas. 
                  A conservation subdivision incorporates, and shall include, all primary conservation areas into undivided, permanent, open spaces. Primary conservation areas, as defined by this Code, include the following: habitats for endangered or threatened species, wetlands, flood plains, state waters, shorelines, and associated buffers, historic, cultural, and archaeological sites, and steep mountain slopes. 
                  (Amd. of 2-2-2004; Amd. of 11-1-2007) 
                  19-3.2. - Secondary conservation areas. 
                  A conservation subdivision shall identify secondary conservation areas and shall integrate all or a portion of them into undivided, permanent, open spaces. "Undivided" refers to contiguous, usable open spaces; small strips of land remaining randomly among parcels or isolated "alley" strips do not qualify as meeting the required conservation areas standards. Secondary conservation areas, as defined by this Code, include the following: prime farmlands or open meadows; tree coverage areas and mature woodlands; aquifer recharge areas; steep slopes, and scenic views and sites. While secondary conservation areas also include designed and newly created open spaces such as neighborhood commons and village greens, these areas must be large enough spaces to constitute a design amenity for community members, not individual yards. The amount of acreage dedicated to secondary conservation areas must equal at least 15 percent of the total primary conservation areas.

                  19-3.3. - Guidelines for secondary conservation areas. 
                  The following section provides standards and guidelines for establishing and protecting secondary conservation areas. Because each site is unique, not all of the following apply; however applicant shall identify features that apply to the subject site - including identifying scenic views, slopes steeper than 35 percent, among others - and shall identify which of the following will be incorporated into the development in order to meet the design intent of this district. 
                  (a)  Site values. Priorities for conserving or developing secondary conservation areas should be based on an understanding of what on the given property is more special, unique, irreplaceable, environmentally valuable, historic, scenic, etc., compared with other similar features and in relationship to neighboring parcels. 
                  (b)  Site homes at edges of fields. Conservation subdivisions should minimize the number of homes sited in open fields, if farmland protection, meadow preservation are principal objectives. Residences should be located adjacent to tree lines and wooded field edges. Maintain irregular field edges when they occur. 
                  (c)  Preserve agricultural structures. Existing agricultural structures such as barns should be preserved where possible. 
                  (d)  Aquifer recharge areas. Conservation subdivisions may be restricted within significant groundwater recharge areas due to an inability to comply with rules for environmental planning criteria as adopted by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division, as may be adopted and implemented by Forsyth County. 
                  (e)  Soils. Development of soils with high erosion susceptibility is discouraged. Hydric soils should be identified and should not be developed unless it can be shown they are not wetlands. House lots should be located on the deepest, driest, or best-drained soils available on the parcel. 
                  (f)  Steep slopes. Where possible, structures should not be placed at the top of ridge lines, and building envelopes should not include ridge lines, in order to preserve the natural view of ridges. Structures required to be sited in steeply sloping areas should have their heights lower than the ridge line. Unless extremely constrained by topography, and where better design layouts are not possible, building envelopes shall not include areas with slopes of 35 percent or more. Lots with slopes of 25 percent or more are discouraged because they: 1) may not ensure the provision of yards suitable for lawns and play areas; 2) pose challenges with respect to septic tank drain fields; and 3) pose erosion control concerns. 
                  (g)  Buffers and screening. 
                  (1)  Conservation subdivisions shall provide a 25-foot exterior buffer 
                  (2)  Stream buffers shall not be incorporated within individual residential lots. 
                  (h)  Scenic views, sites, and vistas. Scenic views, sites, and vistas should be unblocked and uninterrupted. Views can be created or opened up further by pruning limbs and selectively removing trees, as opposed to clear-cutting. 
                  (i)  Active recreational facilities. Active recreational facilities, if provided, shall not be located in the primary or secondary conservation areas; pervious surface pedestrian pathways may be allowed. Active recreational facilities shall not count toward required open space. 
                  (j)  Golf courses prohibited. Golf courses do not comply with the conservation intent of this chapter and thus are not permitted uses.

                  19-3.4. - Required open space specifications. 
                  (a)  Percent of site area. Each conservation subdivision shall provide a minimum of 40 percent of its total land area as open space, as defined by this Code. 
                  (b)  Minimum size. The minimum size of a conservation subdivision shall be 25 acres and shall include no less than five acres of contiguous open space; the purpose of this minimum open space acreage is to avoid prospects where minor subdivisions are proposed simply to reduce lot sizes and development costs or that provide only small, scattered open spaces that would not functionally contribute to the overall open space network of the county. 
                  (c)  Permitted uses. See definitions of primary conservation area, secondary conservation area, active recreational facility, and open space. The county may permit part of the open space within a conservation subdivision to be retained in the hands of the original farmer or leased to a farmer for agricultural uses. Uses not expressly authorized via the rezoning and/or sketch plat process are prohibited. 
                  (d)  Limits of disturbance. No mass clearing or mass grading shall be permitted in the primary or secondary space; encroachments for infrastructure and stormwater shall be granted only for perpendicular buffer crossings that have been reviewed and approved per chapter 18, article XI.

                  19-3.5. - Standards for designing open space networks. 
                  This section provides standards and guidelines for establishing open space networks. 
                  (a)  Minimum width. The width of any open space tract shall be at least 25 feet. 
                  (b)  Location. When a conservation subdivision site abuts an existing conservation area, park, nature preserve, or public undeveloped land, such as the 1085 line of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers around Lake Lanier, conservation areas shall be designed so that they are located along the common boundary line. 
                  (c)  Pedestrian and multi-purpose paths. Open spaces shall provide for pedestrian and/or multi-use paths, between five and eight feet wide, and shall be designed to connect with sidewalk network and/or as functional pathways to common area and/or amenity destinations. Motorized vehicles shall not be permitted on trail systems except for maintenance, construction, or public safety purposes. This prohibition shall be included within the required covenants. Where appropriate and convenient, such pedestrian and multi-purpose paths should be made handicapped accessible. 
                  (d)  Path/street crossings. Where path systems cross an internal subdivision street, the access points should be directly across from each other, clearly identified both to the motorist and pedestrian, and located with appropriate sight distance as determined by the director of engineering, subject to the approval of the engineering department. Where a path crosses any county road, the path should be grade separated (i.e., by a tunnel or bridge), or located at a traffic control device approved by the director of engineering and planning and community development director. 
                  (e)  Prohibited from lots. Paths are not intended to be accessed via easements through individual residential lots. Paths are required to be located external to individual residential lots.

                  19-3.6. - Conservation easement required. 
                  All primary conservation areas, and all secondary conservation areas shown on the rezoning application site plan and/or sketch plat and required to be retained as open space, shall be permanently protected from further subdivision, development, and unauthorized use, by a conservation easement. A conservation easement, as defined by this Code, shall be approved by Forsyth County and 1) co-signed by Forsyth County and donated to a conservation organization or land trust; or 2) co-signed by Forsyth County and donated to a homeowners association; or 3) donated to Forsyth County if accepted by the county. Copies of the draft easements and delineation of primary and secondary conservation areas shall be submitted for review concurrent with the submittal of a land disturbance permit application.

                  19-3.7. - Guidelines for drafting conservation easements. 
                  The following guidelines are offered for drafting conservation easements and may be required: 
                  (a)  The easement recognizes and describes in a statement of purpose the special qualities of the property subject to the easement. Preferably, conditions within the tract subject to the conservation easement are shown by map and/or photograph. 
                  (b)  The easement clearly identifies the owner of the property subject to the easement, the holder of the easement, and co-signer, and the responsibilities of the property owner, easement holder, and co-signer. 
                  (c)  The easement specifically and clearly identifies the boundaries of the property subject to the easement, preferably by metes and bounds legal description and survey plat. 
                  (d)  The easement contains restrictions as to what the owner may do with the property and specifically delineate what may not be done with the property. Limitations may include but may not be confined to prohibitions against subdivision, earthmoving, dumping, signs, utility lines, construction, changes to existing structures, and uses made of the property. 
                  (e)  The easement provides for the right of the easement holder and co-signer to inspect the property to assure observance of restrictions. It also provides for enforcement procedures. 
                  (f)  The easement provides for the maintenance of property. 
                  (g)  The easement contains provisions governing its amendment, including provisions that the easement shall not be altered except with the express written permission of the easement holder, property owner, and any co-signers. 
                  (Amd. of 2-2-2004) 
                  19-3.8. - Required ownership of open spaces. 
                  In addition to a conservation easement, the open space shall be permanently protected through ownership either by a homeowners association or by Forsyth County, if accepted by the county, in accordance with this article. 
                  (Amd. of 2-2-2004) 
                  19-3.9. - Homeowners association. 
                  Open spaces may be owned and managed in common by a homeowners association, subject to the following requirements: 
                  (a)  The developer of the conservation subdivision shall provide to the director for approval, prior to the approval of a final plat, a description of the homeowners association, including bylaws and methods for maintaining open space. 
                  (b)  The homeowners association shall be established by the conservation subdivision developer and endowed with a financial subsidy from the developer prior to the approval of a final plat on the property involving a conservation subdivision. 
                  (c)  Membership of each non-open space lot owner in the conservation subdivision shall be mandatory (required) and automatic. 
                  (d)  The homeowners association shall be responsible for maintenance, insurance, and taxes on the open space within the conservation subdivision. The association shall be required to assess dues for the maintenance of open space, purchase of insurance, and payment of taxes, unless another income source is proven to be available. Members of the association shall share equitably the costs of open space development and maintenance as indicated in bylaws. The association shall be empowered with the legal ability to place liens on non-open space lot owners for failure to pay association dues. 
                  (e)  Said homeowners association shall not be dissolved without the consent of the board of commissioners. If common ownership of open spaces by a homeowners association is proposed and approved, then open spaces shall be subject to permanent deed and final plat restrictions or covenants on the future use, development, and subdivision of open spaces, in addition to the requirement of a conservation easement. 
                  (f)  The board of commissioners may require that the homeowners association establish a minimum amount of funds to be initially deposited and maintained in a maintenance account.

                  19-3.10. - Fee simple dedication to Forsyth County. 
                  Dedication in fee-simple ownership to the public for recreational and/or open space use, is a possible mechanism for the permanent retention and maintenance of open spaces within the conservation subdivision, at the sole discretion of the board of commissioners, and subject to the following: 
                  (a)  Dedication to the county shall only be approved if the board of commissioners finds that the size, shape, location, type of open space, or cost of development or maintenance of such open space or the availability of open space would make public ownership desirable or necessary. 
                  (b)  The decision to accept open spaces for fee simple public ownership shall be at the sole discretion of the board of commissioners but guided by recommendations of the planning and community development director, planning commission, the comprehensive plan as it pertains to open space acquisition, and the county parks and recreation director. 
                  (c)  The board of commissioners generally will require dedication of all open space or park and recreation areas indicated for acquisition in the county's comprehensive plan or capital improvement program. 
                  (d)  The board of commissioners may require a maintenance bond or other financial security with a duration of 12 months following public acceptance in an amount sufficient to ensure that such lands do not cause unwarranted public expenditures because of faulty conditions or construction. The board shall have authority to cash said bond in the event substandard conditions or construction are evident. Otherwise, following the one year period following public dedication, with satisfactory performance, the board shall return the performance bond to the subdivider. 
                  (e)  In addition to the required conservation easement, a deed for open space lands in a form acceptable to the county attorney in favor of Forsyth County shall be signed and recorded prior to the approval of any final plat pertaining to land within the conservation subdivision.

                  ARTICLE IV. - DESIGN STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES FOR LOT CONFIGURATIONS AND BUILDING ORIENTATIONS 
                  In a conventional subdivision, drawing lot lines to meet zoning requirements are one of the first steps in the design process. Identifying house locations should be the third step in the conservation subdivision design process, after determining primary and secondary conservation areas. The following article provides standards and guidelines for conservation subdivisions. 
                  (a)  Homes shall not front directly on off-site streets. 
                  (b)  Each lot shall be abutted on at least one side by open space, unless a design constriction justifies a lot to not meet this criterion (maximizing number of lots does not constitute an acceptable justification). A written notation shall be included to explicitly explain the design constraint for the particular lot. 
                  (c)  Lot widths shall not be less than 60 feet. 
                  (d)  Lots that back up onto permanent open space can be shallower in depth because the existence of open space extends the perceived depths of such lots. 
                  (e)  The minimum setback for buildings and structures on lots abutting primary conservation areas to the rear or side lot line shall be 75 feet along the adjoining lot line and all points therein. 
                  (f)  Fencing should not be provided in between lots and shall not be permitted on the perimeter of conservation subdivisions or abutting conservation areas. 
                  (g)  Setbacks for front, side and rear lot lines shall be a minimum of 15 feet from the front lot line (measured from the edge of the dedicated right of way or from access alley easement), five feet from the side lot line, with a minimum of 20 feet between structures, twenty (20) feet from the rear lot line and 50 feet exterior. 
                  (h)  This chapter does not establish maximum lot sizes and maximum lot widths. However, conservation subdivision designers should strongly consider limiting the size and widths of lots to avoid the look of conventional subdivisions. In most instances, lots in conservation subdivisions should not exceed the minimum lot sizes and lot frontages specified for the zoning district in which it is located.

                  Editor's note— An amendment dated November 1, 2007, amended article V to read as herein set out. Formerly, article V pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Amd. of 9-25-2003; Amd. of 2-2-2004; Amd. of 11-15-2004. 

                  19-5.1. - Density, lot size and yield plan. 
                  In conservation subdivisions, lot sizes are allowed to be smaller than typically found in conventional subdivisions. The minimum lot size shall be as provided in Table 19.1, so as to ensure that lots created will not be substantially out of character with lot sizes in conventional subdivisions within the same zoning district. The development should, however, be density neutral i.e., the overall number of dwellings allowed should be no more than the total number of dwellings a conventional subdivision layout would yield. For this reason, the applicant shall develop a yield plan which shows the site developed as a conventional subdivision and the maximum number of lots the site would theoretically yield. The design of the yield plan must be realistic and account for areas that cannot be developed such as floodplain, stream buffers and wetlands.

                  ARTICLE VI. - DESIGN STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES FOR STREETS 

                  19-6.1. - Introduction. 
                  After identifying all primary conservation areas, secondary conservation areas, potential development areas, and house sites, the fifth step in the conservation subdivision design process is to design the street alignments. Lot lines are drawn as a fourth step, after the open spaces, house sites, and road network have been determined. This article provides standards and guidelines for designing streets serving conservation subdivisions. While the entire set of items below are not requirements, site plans shall demonstrate substantial compliance with the following standard practices of developing true conservation subdivision design. 
                  (Amd. of 2-2-2004; Amd. of 11-1-2007) 
                  19-6.2. - Location and alignment. 
                  Designers should avoid crossing wetlands with streets where possible. Existing farm roads should be incorporated into conservation subdivision designs. Roads should follow existing contours with a minimum of cut and fills and disturbance for construction. In cases where agricultural protection or meadow preservation is a primary objective, new roads should be placed along the edge of a field, rather than through the middle, so as to be less intrusive on the open space character of the tract. 
                  (Amd. of 2-2-2004) 
                  19-6.3. - Lengths and curves. 
                  The length of roads should be minimized to reduce costs and aesthetic impacts. Long, straight road segments should be avoided. Curvilinear designs are preferred for rural conservation subdivisions. Streets should be curved and aligned to produce vistas of open space elements, where possible. Short, straight, interconnected streets (i.e., grid patterns) are appropriate for village areas when included in conservation subdivisions. 
                  (Amd. of 2-2-2004) 
                  19-6.4. - Separate travel lanes. 
                  Where necessary, the directional travel lanes should split or curve apart to protect natural features. In cases where travel lanes are split or curve apart, the minimum width of each travel lane should be ten feet in paved width. 
                  (Amd. of 2-2-2004) 
                  19-6.5. - Right-of-way and clearance. 
                  Rights-of-way should be only wide enough to accommodate the required street width improvement, adequate shoulder bases for utilities, bikeways and/or walkways, and open storm drainage ditches at appropriate bank slope. Drainage easements may be provided in lieu of expanding the right-of-way for drainage ditches if approved by the director of engineering. The entire right-of-way may not necessarily have to be cleared if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the director of engineering that remaining trees or other features do not pose a traffic safety hazard. 
                  (Amd. of 2-2-2004) 
                  19-6.6. - Connections. 
                  Streets shall be connected with one another unless doing so involves traversing designated conservation areas; preferably streets connect in three-way intersections, so that the number of dead ends are minimized. An exception will be allowed when a street connection would cross conservation areas and break up open space amenities, in which case section 19-6.7 provisions shall govern. Whenever possible, streets should be designed to connect with adjoining properties. 
                  (Amd. of 2-2-2004; Amd. of 11-1-2007) 
                  19-6.7. - Culs-de-sac. 
                  Traditional culs-de-sac are discouraged. Culs-de-sac create large expanse of impervious cover and increase the amount of stormwater runoff. As such, street loops, "hammerhead" and/or cul-de-sac with planted centers meet the intent and purpose of conservation subdivision districts and shall be the preferred design option for non-connecting street ends. See also Figures 19.4 and 19.5 of conservation subdivisions that feature design solutions to the traditional cul-de-sac. 
                  (Amd. of 2-2-2004; Amd. of 11-1-2007) 
                  19-6.8. - Reverse curves. 
                  For roads serving less than 2,000 average daily traffic and where speed limits are controlled to prevent high-speed traffic, reverse curves (consecutive left and right curves without a straight segment separating them) are considered appropriate and may be encouraged, subject to the approval of the director of engineering. 
                  (Amd. of 2-2-2004) 
                  19-6.9. - Single-loading streets. 
                  "Single-loading streets" (i.e., having houses only on one side) are considered appropriate and encouraged, particularly around village greens or neighborhood commons. 
                  (Amd. of 2-2-2004) 
                  19-6.10. - Curbs and drainage. 
                  Because curbs detract from rural character of conservation subdivisions, natural drainage systems are encouraged in lieu of curbs in conservation subdivisions located in rural areas. Existing natural drainage ways should be retained where possible. The director of engineering may require curbs when in his/her opinion curbs are considered essential to adequately handle storm drainage and allow for the placement of underground utilities. 
                  (Amd. of 2-2-2004) 
                  19-6.11. - Street trees. 
                  Street tree plantings are encouraged, provided that they are located so as not to present a traffic safety hazard, as determined by the director of engineering. 
                  (Amd. of 2-2-2004) 
                  19-6.12. - Sidewalks. 
                  Concrete or asphalt sidewalks may detract from the character of rural conservation subdivisions. Safe access for pedestrians and bicyclists should be provided via a trail system in the open spaces and where needed along the improved or semi-improved shoulders of roads. 
                  (Amd. of 2-2-2004) 
                  19-6.13. - Signage. 
                  In cases where it is determined that signs identifying street entrances to conservation subdivisions are appropriate, the signage should be limited to one monument sign per entrance to the off-site road with an area not to exceed eight square feet, constructed of natural materials (i.e., wood or stone) with landscaping at the base of the monument. This provision is not intended to apply to traffic safety signs within public rights-of-ways; provided, however, that traffic safety signs should be constructed of materials compatible with the conservation subdivision as opposed to following standard county specifications, subject to approval of the director of engineering.

                  ARTICLE VII. - PROCEDURES 
                  In addition to the application procedures for zoning approval, sketch plat approval, preliminary and final plat approval, as specified in chapter 18 of this Code, conservation subdivisions shall comply with the following procedures. 

                  19-7.1. - Pre-application conference. 
                  A pre-application conference with the planning and community development department is required prior to the submission of a rezoning or sketch plat application, including those submitted as conceptual plans as part of a rezoning application. At the time of a pre-application conference, the department shall make available all relevant information about primary and secondary conservation areas, including soil survey, natural resource maps, and geographic information. The department may charge reasonable reproduction costs for this information. Ideally, the pre-application conference will be preceded by the submittal of a boundary survey of the property to be subdivided with sufficient time for the department to collect applicable information.

                  19-7.2. - Existing features and site analysis. 
                  The applicant shall submit an analysis of existing features on the site, to at minimum include the following: 
                  (a)  Significant wildlife habitats, if any. If information on habitats is not available, the wildlife potential of various soil types on the site shall be identified and examined. 
                  (b)  Soils, including analysis of suitability for septic tanks, erosion potential, prime farmland, and identification of hydric soils. 
                  (c)  Wetlands. 
                  (d)  Floodplains. Areas of 100 year flood plain as identified on flood hazard boundary maps or flood insurance rate maps developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
                  (e)  Steep mountain slopes and steep slopes, as defined by this Code. 
                  (f)  Historic, archaeological, and cultural features. Applicant shall refer to the Forsyth County Historic Resources Survey and data from the state archeologist (historic preservation division of the department of natural resources) when developing in areas of suspected cultural and/or historical resources. 
                  (g)  Tree cover/woodlands. 
                  (h)  Views into and out from the site, and any scenic qualities. 
                  (i)  Aquifer recharge areas.

                  ARTICLE VIII. - CRITERIA FOR APPROVAL 

                  19-8.1. - Evaluation criteria for approval. 
                  In addition to the criteria listed in article V of chapter 8, evaluation criteria for a rezoning approval or sketch plat for a conservation subdivision shall be based on the extent to which the plan meets the following criteria: 
                  (a)  All primary conservation areas are protected as permanent open space. 
                  (b)  A sufficient amount of secondary conservation areas are protected as permanent open space, as opposed to being devoted to lots and other uses including but not limited to sewage treatment facilities, and storm water management. "Sufficient" means that secondary areas meet requirements established within section 19-3.2, but also meet the over-all intent of conservation design. 
                  (c)  The configuration of the open space tract is contiguous and undivided. 
                  (d)  The conservation subdivision meets the regulations specified in this chapter. 
                  (e)  The conservation subdivision meets applicable provisions of chapter 18, subdivisions of this Code, to the extent they are interpreted by the director to be applicable to a conservation subdivision.

                  19-8.2. - Grounds for denial. 
                  In addition to the criteria listed in section 18-6.2 and article V of chapter 8 of this Code, approval or denial of a rezoning and/or sketch plat application for a conservation subdivision shall include but are not limited to the following: 
                  (a)  The application fails to fully identify primary and secondary conservation areas, or the amount of the secondary conservation areas are determined to be insufficient. 
                  (b)  The proposed method of sewage treatment is inappropriate for the site or found to be potentially dangerous to public heath. 
                  (c)  One or more of the lots within the conservation subdivision are too small to meet the minimum lot size established by this chapter. 
                  (d)  The street configuration does not provide for connectivity, or preserve natural features, or it is found to be inconsistent with the open space character of the subject property and its surroundings. 
                  (e)  The proposed open space network is divided, not functional, inconsistent with open space plans of the county, or does not provide for the protection of the most valuable secondary conservation areas on the site given the natural and scenic properties inherent on the site, as substantiated by photographs or other documentation. 
                  (f)  The proposed open space network fails to maximize the length of the common boundary between conservation areas on site and conservation areas or parkland abutting the conservation subdivision site. 
                  (g)  The rezoning application and/or sketch plat appears to be submitted for the major purpose of circumventing improvement requirements that would otherwise be required for conventional subdivisions pursuant to chapter 18 of this Code 
                  (h)  The design fails to incorporate standards and guidelines established herein, thus failing to comply with the intention of conservation subdivisions, and/or the yield plan indicates that the application was submitted for the major purpose of increasing lot yield only.

                  ARTICLE I. - PURPOSE AND INTENT AND APPLICABILITY 

                  20A-1.1. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The provisions of this chapter are intended to establish a zoning district that will: 
                  (a)  Encourage and allow the development of tracts of land as planned neighborhoods or communities according to designs that coordinate building forms that are interrelated and architecturally harmonious; 
                  (b)  Encourage and allow unique, flexible, creative, and imaginative arrangements and mixes of land use in site planning and community development, consistent with the Comprehensive Plan of Forsyth County; 
                  (c)  Encourage a broader mix of residential housing types, including detached and attached dwellings, than would normally be constructed in conventional subdivisions; 
                  (d)  Preserve the natural amenities of the land through maintenance of conservation areas and open spaces within developments, provide amenities, and provide where needed the civic and semi-public uses (e.g., schools, playgrounds, meeting halls, etc.) that help to make up a community; 
                  (e)  Provide for an efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets and thereby lower development and housing costs; and 
                  (f)  Provide an environment of stable character compatible with surrounding residential areas; 
                  (g)  Establish application requirements that are more rigorous than the requirements for rezoning to other zoning districts but no more onerous than is necessary to enable thorough analyses; 
                  (h)  Provide for slightly higher gross and net development densities and intensities as an inducement to develop in a manner consistent with the purposes of this chapter.

                  20A-1.2. - Development as a unit. 
                  The land within an approved planned unit development district is intended to be planned and developed by a single developer or group as a single, entire unit of land. Land within a planned unit development district shall not be subdivided and sold to others prior to completion of the installation of required improvements. 
                  (Amd. of 12-20-2004) 
                  ARTICLE II. - USES PERMITTED WITHIN PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS 

                  20A-2.1. - Generally. 
                  It is the intent of the planned unit development district to provide maximum flexibility with regard to the mixture of land uses. Within a planned unit development district, any land use, may be permitted if such use or uses can be shown to provide an orderly relation and function to other uses in the development and to existing land uses, as well as with due regard to the Comprehensive Plan of Forsyth County. The permitted use or uses of property located in the planned unit development shall be determined at the time the zoning district and development plan is approved, and development within the district shall be limited to those uses specifically requested as part of the application and approved by the board of commissioners, unless otherwise specifically noted in the board's approval of the planned unit development zoning district. 
                  (Amd. of 12-20-2004) 
                  20A-2.2. - Recommendations. 
                  The following principles for proposing and mixing land uses are recommended: 
                  (a)  Uses should be predominantly residential in accordance with the use recommendations of the comprehensive plan; 
                  (b)  Where appropriate, the planned unit development should provide for more than just one type of dwelling unit, such as townhouses, duplexes, and multi-family dwellings; 
                  (c)  Multi-family dwellings should not comprise more than 25 percent of the total dwelling units within the proposed development; 
                  (d)  Sites for places of worship, schools, community or club buildings, and similar civic or semi-public facilities are encouraged to be provided, where appropriate; 
                  (e)  Commercial and offices uses, if proposed, should be located in careful relation to other land uses within and outside of the development; they should be scaled so that they primarily serve the occupants of the planned unit development; they should be designed and oriented to face the interior of the planned unit development rather than oriented toward passer-by traffic exterior to the planned unit development; In residential districts, the amount of land in a planned unit development devoted to commercial and office uses should not exceed 15 percent of the unit of land within the planned unit development unless it can be shown that a greater percentage of land devoted to such uses is more conducive to the mix of uses. 
                  (f)  Industrial uses are not typically considered to be appropriate for inclusion within planned unit developments; however, such uses are not prohibited and may be proposed and approved in larger (e.g., 20 acres or more) planned unit developments where living and working areas need to be proximate to one another, subject to separation and screening requirements to avoid nuisances.

                  ARTICLE III. - PERFORMANCE STANDARDS 

                  20A-3.1. - Minimum acreage. 
                  A planned unit development district must contain a minimum area of 20 contiguous acres. 
                  (Amd. of 12-20-2004) 
                  20A-3.2. - Dimensional requirements. 
                  There shall be no requirements for minimum lot size, minimum lot width, lot coverage and setbacks, or height requirements that apply to planned unit developments. Dimensional requirements shall be as proposed by the applicant of the planned unit development and as approved by the planning commission and board of commissioners via a letter of intent and detailed site plan approved during the rezoning process, and as may be subsequently shown on the sketch plat approved by the planning commission.

                  20A-3.3. - Residential density. 
                  The maximum number of dwelling units per acre in residential areas of the planned unit development should not exceed 1.2 times the gross density recommended by the future land use map of the comprehensive plan for the unit of land unless such density is found the board of commissioners to be justified to achieve the goals of the land use plan. For purposes of this section, density shall be interpreted as the number of dwelling units per gross area devoted to residential development, and, in addition to land area and parcels used primarily for residential purposes, all open spaces including private lakes reserved for common usage within the planned unit development. Gross acreage for residential development shall exclude areas of dedicated street rights-of-way existing prior to development, and all lands devoted to non-residential uses. 
                  (Amd. of 12-20-2004) 
                  20A-3.4. - Recommendations for design. 
                  (a)  Unless topographical or other barriers protect the privacy of existing adjoining uses, structures or buildings located at the perimeter of the planned unit development should be setback a distance of at least 100 feet to protect the privacy and amenities of adjacent, existing uses. 
                  (b)  Structures or buildings located at the perimeter of the development should be permanently screened in a manner that sufficiently protects the privacy and amenities of the adjacent, existing uses. 
                  (c)  Portions of the development containing commercial and office uses are specifically encouraged to conform to the general site development and design regulations for commercial and office zoning districts as specified in chapter 12, article X of this Code. 
                  (d)  Planned unit developments of sufficient size are specifically encouraged to conform to the design guidelines for activity centers provided in chapter 13 of this Code, as may be considered appropriate to the specific land development context. 
                  (e)  Residential portions of planned unit developments that are intended to be subdivided are specifically encouraged to conform to provisions for conservation subdivisions as specified in chapter 19 of this Code, as may be considered appropriate to the specific land development context. 
                  (f)  Land uses proposed to be a part of a planned unit development that have Code provisions specifically pertaining to such uses, as specified in chapter 16 of this Code, will typically be expected to comply with the applicable requirements of chapter 16, unless specific reasons can be show why such requirements should not apply.

                  CHAPTER 20B. - MASTER PLANNED DISTRICT 
                  ARTICLE I. - PURPOSE AND INTENT 

                  20B-1.1. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The master planned district is intended to provide for mixed-use development. Uses must complement and be compatible with the orderly development of the project as well as surrounding land uses. The master planned district may be developed in distinct pods or can be integrated with a mix of uses being interspersed with one another, including multiple uses within the same structure. The density of residential development and intensity of nonresidential development should be consistent with the recommendations of the Forsyth County Comprehensive Plan. 
                  The provisions of this chapter are intended to establish a zoning district that will: 
                  (a)  Provide a mechanism to incorporate and implement the goals and intent of the Forsyth County Comprehensive Plan in a manner that is not possible in conventional zoning classifications; 
                  (b)  Allow for a mixture of complementary land uses based upon the existing and planned road networks in order to assure safe and efficient transportation patterns; 
                  (c)  Provide for an orderly and creative arrangement of land uses in relation to each other and to the surrounding community; 
                  (d)  Provide for the mobility of all inhabitants by walking, biking, or other means of transportation with diminished emphasis on the automobile; 
                  (e)  Maintain mobility along traffic corridors and state highways; 
                  (f)  Provide transitions between high traffic corridors and low density residential development; 
                  (g)  Create a development of the highest architectural and aesthetic quality by demonstrating such standards via an approval process that is more rigorous than the requirements for rezoning to other zoning districts but no more onerous than is necessary to enable thorough analysis; 
                  (h)  Minimize the environmental impacts of new development; 
                  (i)  Promote the efficient use of land resulting in networks of utilities, streets, and other infrastructure features that maximize the allocation of fiscal and natural resources; 
                  (j)  Stage development of this type in a manner which can be accommodated by the timely provision of public utilities, public facilities, public services, and public road improvements; and 
                  (k)  Encourage the creation of new employment opportunities.

                  ARTICLE II. - USES PERMITTED 

                  20B-2.1. - General. 
                  Uses shall provide an orderly relation and function to other uses in the development and to existing land uses, as well as with due regard to the Comprehensive Plan of Forsyth County. Development within the district shall be limited to those uses specifically requested as part of the master development plan and approved by the board of commissioners, unless otherwise specifically noted in the approval of the master planned district. 
                  (Amd. of 12-20-2004) 
                  20B-2.2. - Commercial and office uses. 
                  The amount of commercial and office land use within the master planned district shall be determined based on the amount of open space provided as shown in Table 20B.1. Land use calculations shall be calculated by gross floor area for master planned districts that contain a vertical mixture of uses and shall be calculated by total project land area for master planned districts that contain a horizontal mixture of uses.

                  20B-2.3. - Residential uses. 
                  The residential density within the master planned district shall be determined based on the maximum density as shown in Table 20B.1. Land use calculations shall be calculated by gross floor area for master planned districts that contain a vertical mixture of uses and shall be calculated by total project land area for master planned districts that contain a horizontal mixture of uses. For the residential allotment of units for the master planned district, the following maximums shall apply: 
                  (a)  Thirty percent of total residential units for townhomes and/or condominiums. 
                  (b)  Twenty percent of total residential units for apartments.

                  20B-2.4. - Open space. 
                  The Master Planned District shall require that open space be provided based on the percentage of commercial and office uses for the entire master plan district area, in accordance with Table 20B.1. For the purposes of this chapter, open space shall include areas within the master planned district designed and intended for the active and passive recreational needs of the residential and employment based population of the master planned district or for the public in general. Open space shall be owned by a homeowners association or similar body and shall not be part of individual residential lots. Table 20B-1 provides a summary of the percentage requirements.

                  20B-4.1. - Pre-application meeting. 
                  Before submitting an application for rezoning to master planned district, the applicant shall confer with the director to determine the feasibility for the proposed plan and its relationship to the Forsyth County Comprehensive Plan and the Unified Development Code. 
                  (Amd. of 12-20-2004) 
                  20B-4.2. - Master development plan. 
                  To enable a thorough analysis of an application for the master planned district, the application requirements exceed those of other zoning districts. In addition to the standard requirements, applications for the master planned district shall include a master development plan. To avoid duplication, the information required for the master development plan can be combined with the standard requirements to amend the official zoning map. The master development plan shall include: 
                  (a)  The uniform plan. A plan of the project showing the location of proposed zones and the general trajectories of the various thoroughfares. At a minimum, the uniform plan shall differentiate between the following zones: 
                  (1)  Residential zones. 
                  (2)  Shopping, business, or trade zones. 
                  (3)  Civic and institutional zones. 
                  (4)  Open space zones. 
                  (5)  Vertical mixed use zones. 
                  The applicant may develop more specific zones and or modify the name of the zones to better represent the theme of the proposed master planned district. An application is not required to include each of the zones listed above, see article II of this chapter for requirements related to permitted uses. 
                  (b)  Land use standards. A matrix of text and or diagrams that regulate the permitted uses and performance standards for each zone identified in the uniform plan. Regulations of the Unified Development Code that are not listed in the land use standards shall default to the standards identified in other chapters, which will be determined by the director in any case in which applying the regulations of other chapters would be unclear. At a minimum, the following SHALL BE ESTABLISHED FOR EACH ZONE IDENTIFIED IN THE UNIFORM PLAN: 
                  (1)  Permitted uses. 
                  (2)  Minimum lot size. 
                  (3)  Minimum lot width. 
                  (4)  Minimum setbacks. 
                  (5)  Minimum building separation. 
                  (6)  Buffers and impervious surface setbacks. 
                  (7)  Maximum height. 
                  (8)  Maximum building coverage. 
                  (9)  Parking and loading requirements. 
                  (c)  Community standards. The community standards are a written code that will be utilized by the developer to ensure continuity throughout the life of the project. All master planned districts shall require the establishment of a board responsible for the enforcement of the community standards. The community standards are intended to produce visual compatibility among various building types and shall be required prior to the issuance of a building permit. At a minimum, the community standards shall address lighting, signage, fences, landscaping, building materials, building colors, and other architectural features.

                  ARTICLE V. - CRITERIA FOR APPROVAL 

                  20B-5.1. - Standard criteria. 
                  In considering and acting upon applications for rezoning to the master planned district, the planning commission and the board of commissioners shall consider and base their recommendation and decision, respectively, on the general considerations and special considerations described in chapter 8, article V of this Code; provided, however, that the planning commission and board of commissioners will additionally consider the extent to which the proposal follows the recommendations and requirements of this chapter. 
                  (Amd. of 12-20-2004) 
                  20B-5.2. - Design criteria. 
                  In addition to the standard criteria, the following design criteria will be used to evaluate the rezoning application's conformity with the purpose and intent of this chapter. Appropriate criteria that have not been incorporated into the master development plan will be utilized to develop recommended zoning conditions as part of the review process. 
                  (a)  General site design. 
                  (1)  The minimum size for a master planned district should not be less than 40 acres. 
                  (2)  A functional town center, community green, park, or other focal point should be included to create character and identity. 
                  (3)  Perimeter setbacks and buffers should protect the privacy and amenity of adjoining uses both existing and anticipated. 
                  (4)  The master planned district should incorporate multi-modal transportation elements in the development, depending on the foreseeable needs of future residents and users of the site, and the relationship of the project site to the community at large. Such multi-modal elements may include provisions for mass transit stops or stations, carpooling lots, pedestrian and bicycle paths and lanes, bicycle parking areas, and other similar provisions. 
                  (5)  A grid system of streets is preferred over cul-de-sac designs. Block length should be conducive to pedestrian traffic. 
                  (6)  Interconnections to adjoining property, whether developed or undeveloped, should be included and incorporated into the design where appropriate. Proposed parcels should be arranged and designed so as to allow for the opening of future streets and provide access to those areas not presently served by streets. 
                  (b)  Aesthetic quality. 
                  (1)  When appropriate, streets should terminate at a focal point, which may be a civic building, principal use, place of worship, bell tower, gazebo, or other similar feature. 
                  (2)  The location and width of residential garage doors should be designed so as to not dominate the streetscape. Standards on garage width and garage setbacks should be used to ensure that garage doors do not dominate the streetscape. 
                  (3)  Attached housing should be designed to reduce the monolithic nature of the structure. 
                  (4)  Fences, walls, and berms should be designed and maintained in relationship with the character of the surrounding land uses and structures. Retaining walls should be constructed of architectural masonry or faced with rock, brick, and/or constructed to blend with adjacent surroundings. 
                  (5)  Detention and retention structures are discouraged in areas subject to view from a public street if not used both for aesthetic purposes and designed so as to not require a fenced enclosure. 
                  (6)  Master planned districts are encouraged to utilize creative methods for stormwater management, when such methods provide additional open space opportunities. 
                  (7)  Service and loading zones should be located to minimize visibility from public streets and neighboring properties. 
                  (c)  Site development. 
                  (1)  Transitions at property edges should seem natural for the surrounding terrain. 
                  (2)  Cut and fill slopes should be rounded where they meet natural grade so that they blend with the natural slope. 
                  (d)  Parking. 
                  (1)  Decorative fences or walls, plantings, berms, or other similar features should be used to screen surface parking lots from public view or soften their visual impact. 
                  (2)  The location and design of parking structures should minimize their visibility from the street or other public areas. 
                  (3)  Surface parking lots should be oriented behind or to the side of a building when possible. Surface parking lots should not be located on street corners. 
                  (e)  Pedestrian scale. 
                  (1)  For predominantly nonresidential areas, activities such as shops, offices or other commercial space should be located along the ground level of street frontage. 
                  (2)  For nonresidential uses, corner buildings should make a strong tie to the building lines of each street. However, this does not preclude angled or sculpted building corners or an open plaza at the corner. Vertical focal points to visually "anchor" corners are encouraged. 
                  (3)  Comfortable and attractive street furniture should be provided in public spaces for public enjoyment, comfort, and convenience. These may include seats and benches, drinking fountains, trash receptacles, information kiosks, directories, or other similar features. 
                  (4)  Nonresidential building entrances should be visible from the street, well-lit, and easily accessible. Articulation such as canopies and roof forms should be used to further identify entrances. 
                  (5)  Nonresidential uses that face a street or pedestrian area should have transparent windows along each first floor wall. 
                  (6)  Nonresidential buildings should have at least one entrance facing every abutting street. 
                  (7)  Clear pedestrian and visual paths should be established using a combination of covered arcades, covered walkways, courtyards, landscape patterns, consistent paving materials, minimal interruption of pedestrian paths, and other similar features. 
                  (8)  Sidewalks should be present in all residential areas. In nonresidential areas, sidewalks should be present along both sides of all streets. 
                  (f)  Landscape and natural environment. 
                  (1)  Specific emphasis should be placed on the preservation or planting of trees between buildings and the street. 
                  (2)  Existing topography, significant tree cover, state waters and other natural features should be considered and incorporated into the project design whenever possible. 
                  (3)  Required open space should be distributed throughout the project. 
                  (g)  Built environment. 
                  (1)  The height of any structure should be compatible with the existing buildings in the area, and proposed structures within the project site. 
                  (2)  Limitations on the height, size, and type of exterior signage should produce an overall theme that is compatible with proposed buildings and surrounding property.

                  21-7.1. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this overlay district is to establish minimum standards for site development, exterior architectural design, landscaping, and signage of buildings that contribute to the district's overall character within a phased development approach to commercial and residential expansion. This is accomplished through the protection and preservation of the district's rural qualities, enhancement of commercial growth through unity of design and quality architecture, and the creation of visual interest through landscape and architectural features scaled for pedestrian use. Design standards are intended to ensure coordinated design of building exteriors in order to promote architectural congruence, positively impact adjacent properties, and produce buildings that augment the character and appearance of the area. It is the goal of this overlay to promote freedom in design while establishing a baseline for design compatibility. This goal is in accordance with the county's objective to encourage landscaping, signage, building design, and other development regulations that enhance the image of the county and create value as stated in the economic development section of the comprehensive plan's implementation program. In addition, the overlay district complies with the respective subarea visions which state that commercial development will take the form of nodes and will adopt appropriate design standards to promote quality development throughout the subarea. The subarea visions also maintain that residential communities will have close proximity to jobs and commercial areas while preserving rural character.

                  ARTICLE VIII. - PEACHTREE PARKWAY-BETHELVIEW ROAD OVERLAY DISTRICT 

                  21-8.1. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this overlay district is to establish minimum standards for non-residential site development, exterior architectural design, landscaping, lighting and signage that contribute to the district's overall character. This is accomplished through enhancement of commercial growth through unity of design and quality architecture and the creation of visual interest through landscape and architectural features. Design standards are intended to ensure coordinated design of building exteriors in order to promote visual congruence, positively impact adjacent properties, and produce buildings that augment the character and appearance of the area. It is the goal of this ordinance to promote freedom in design while establishing a baseline for design compatibility. This goal is in accordance with the county's objective to encourage landscaping, signage, building design, and other development regulations that enhance the image of the county and create value as stated in the implementation program of the Comprehensive Plan. In addition, the overlay district complies with the respective subarea visions which state that the vicinity will be the site of quality development and business opportunities. The subarea visions also maintain that the area will be known to have grown in a responsible manner, offering residents a high quality of life as well as opportunities for employment, shopping, and recreation.

                  Footnotes: 
                  --- (24) --- 
                  Editor's note— An amendment adopted May 19, 2016, amended article XI in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former article XI, §§ 21-11.1—21-11.10, pertained to similar subject matter. See Code Comparative Table for complete derivation. 

                  21-11.1. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this overlay district is to establish minimum standards for any site development, exterior architectural design, landscaping, lighting and signage that contribute to the district's overall character. This is accomplished through enhancement of commercial growth through unity of design and quality architecture and the creation of visual interest through landscape and architectural features. Design standards are intended to ensure coordinated design of building exteriors in order to promote visual congruence, positively impact adjacent properties, and produce buildings that augment the character and appearance of the area. It is the goal of this ordinance to promote freedom in design while establishing a baseline for design compatibility. This goal is in accordance with the county's objective to encourage landscaping, signage, building design, and other development regulations that enhance the image of the county and create value as stated in the implementation program of the Comprehensive Plan. In addition, this overlay is intended to increase design functionality of vehicle related establishments and to mitigate impacts of commercial uses on residential areas through additional site design considerations. Buford Highway is a major arterial roadway that handles significant volumes of traffic and is therefore highly visible to the traveling public. The enhancement of this well-traveled corridor through a unification of its visual context by way of appropriate design measures offers benefits such as the protection of land values through improved appearance and utility that may foster business attraction.

                  21-12.2. - Delineation of district. 
                  The Coal Mountain Overlay District applies to all properties indicated on the Official Overlay District Map of Forsyth County. Where land is located in the Coal Mountain Overlay District, the regulations governing development in the overlay district shall apply in addition to the regulations governing development in the underlying base zoning district. In the event of an express conflict between the standards governing a base zoning district and those governing this overlay district, the standards governing the overlay district shall control. Improvements to existing residential structures are exempt, but such exemption shall not apply to an existing residential structure being converted to a nonresidential use.

                  21-12.4. - Design plan administrative review. 
                  Design review for development within the Coal Mountain Overlay shall be performed by staff with the input and assistance of the district commissioner. Should a design not meet all of the standards contained within the regulations of this article, then the proposed design must be submitted, for public hearing, to the Forsyth County Board of Commissioners for review and approval as an alternate design review process. Architectural elevations, exterior finish schedules, landscape, and lighting plans must be submitted to the department at the time of application for a land disturbance permit. See chapter 7 for land disturbance and building permit procedures. Plans shall address and conform to all provisions set forth under chapter 21, article 8. 
                  (Amd. of 7-6-2017(1)) 
                  21-12.5. - Site design standards. 
                  (a)  Access. Access standards are intended to provide safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian access within developments and between adjacent developments and to lessen traffic congestion and increase connectivity. 
                  (1)  New developments and substantial improvements to existing developments shall provide for pedestrian and automobile access connections between adjacent properties. The director shall have the discretion to waive this requirement if the anticipated land uses are incompatible. 
                  (2)  Parcels and buildings must be arranged and designed so as to allow for the opening of future streets and must provide access to those areas not presently served by streets. No development may be designed to completely eliminate street access to abutting parcels. 
                  (3)  The stub-out street right-of-way, pavement, and curbing must extend to the boundary of the abutting parcel at the point where the connection to the anticipated street is expected. 
                  (4)  If a stub-out street exists next to an abutting parcel, the street system of any new or substantially renovated development must connect to the stub-out street to form a through street. 
                  (5)  The department may eliminate the requirement for a stub-out street or require pedestrian and bicycle-only access when steep slopes in excess of 25 percent, freeways, waterways, tree conservation areas, stream buffers, cemeteries, open space or easements would make the provision of a stub-out street infeasible. 
                  (6)  Where pedestrian crossings must cross parking areas and drives, decorative paving material (i.e., pavers, stamped or textured concrete, or color concrete) shall be used to delineate the pedestrian crossing. 
                  (b)  Any building expansion, expansion of outdoor storage, outdoor display, or parking areas exceeding ten percent of the existing area or 1,000 square feet, whichever is less, will trigger conformance to current site design standards, including but not limited to landscape strips, parking islands, and any applicable screening. 
                  (c)  Landscaping. Landscape treatment shall serve to create as well as reinforce identity through the formation of a spine for the Coal Mountain Overlay by establishing a corridor of uniformity that runs through each character node providing an element of consistency throughout the district. Plant material and design decisions are to be thoughtfully considered as complementary to architectural features and integral to the beauty of the area. These landscape standards shall apply to both residentially and non-residentially zoned properties with the exception of streets internal to residential subdivisions. In addition to landscape regulations, the county welcomes opportunities to form roadway median adoption programs and encourages partnerships that aid continued beautification efforts. Ongoing commitment from partners is necessary to implement preferred design measures and to provide proper maintenance. Landscape plans shall be submitted to the department for design review. The following is in addition to Ordinance No. 98 (Tree Protection and Replacement Ordinance) as well as any required buffer, and shall be implemented: 
                  (1)  Plantings shall be compatible in regard to species selection and must provide a cohesive transition between landscape areas. 
                  (2)  A minimum 20-foot wide landscape strip shall be installed along existing or proposed rights-of-way for all development within the Coal Mountain Overlay District; except that to the extent a specific zoning designation establishes a greater landscape strip requirement than this overlay, the larger requirement shall control. These landscape strips shall be located behind utility easements so plant material will not be disturbed after installment. 
                  (3)  All landscape strips shall be composed of shrubs and/or herbaceous plants in addition to the prescribed tree pairings listed below. The remaining ground area shall be sodded, seeded, or hydroseeded with grass and/or planted with groundcover species. 
                  a.  A minimum of 40 percent of all trees and shrubs shall be evergreen plant material. The percentage shall be based on the total number of installed trees and shrubs. 
                  b.  Landscape strips shall include a minimum of two trees and six shrubs per 50 linear feet, with a minimum of 60 percent overstory requirement per 50 linear feet. Trees shall count towards the tree density requirements as outlined in Ordinance 98 (Tree Protection and Replacement Ordinance). 
                  c.  Plants should be of larger caliper and size to create a pleasant and immediate impact upon installation. Overstory trees shall have a minimum three-inch caliper and at least ten-foot height at time of installation. Understory trees shall have a minimum two-inch caliper and at least eight-foot height at time of installation. All proposed shrubs shall be a minimum of two feet high at the time of planting. 
                  d.  Landscaping may be informal with multiple species arrayed in naturalistic clusters. 
                  e.  All vinyl fencing is prohibited with the boundary of the Coal Mountain Overlay. 
                  f.  Sixty percent of all required trees in landscape strips along the proposed future rights-of-way of SR 369, SR 9, and SR 306 shall be Nuttall Oak. Thirty-three percent of all required trees in landscape strips along the proposed future rights-of-way of Whitmire Road, Wallace Tatum Road, Dr. Bramblett Road, Elmo Road, John Burruss Road, Bannister Road, Hubert Martin Road, Gravitt Road, Spot Road, Setting Down Road, Freedom Parkway, Martin Road, Holtzclaw Road, Burruss Mill Road, and Shady Grove Road shall be Nuttall Oak. 
                  g.  Within the boundary of the Coal Mountain Node, 40 percent of all required trees in landscape strips along the proposed future rights-of-way of SR 369 and SR 9 shall be Redbud 'The Rising Sun.' Thirty-three percent of all required trees in landscape strips along the proposed future rights-of-way of Setting Down Road shall be Redbud 'The Rising Sun.' 
                  h.  Within the boundary of the Hammond's Crossing Node, 40 percent of all required trees in landscape strips along the proposed future rights-of-way of SR 369 and SR 306 shall be Black Gum 'Wildfire.' Thirty-three percent of all required trees in landscape strips along the proposed future rights-of-way of Martin Road shall be Black Gum 'Wildfire.' 
                  i.  Within the boundary of the Matt Node, 40 percent of all required trees in landscape strips along the proposed future rights-of-way of SR 369 shall be Florida Dogwood 'Cherokee Princess.' Thirty-three percent of all required trees in landscape strips along the proposed future rights-of-way of Dr. Bramblett Road, Elmo Road, John Burruss Road, and Bannister Road shall be Florida Dogwood 'Cherokee Princess.' 
                  j.  The director shall have the discretion to modify required tree species as required by UDC 21-12.5(f)—(i) and, in the discretion of the director, to authorize fencing to substitute for all or a portion of the required landscape strip. 
                  (4)  For residential projects over 25 acres, a landscaped entrance median shall be required. Planting shall include a combination of perennials, annuals, and shrub material. The use of understory trees is encouraged. 
                  (5)  Species selected for installation within the Coal Mountain Overlay boundary shall be chosen from Table 21.4. Native plant choices are preferred for hardiness and water requirements. Cultivar alternatives for species identified in Table 21.4 to be approved by the county arborist. 
                  (6)  Administrative variance. Notwithstanding any other provision in the UDC, the landscape strip requirements in the Coal Mountain Overlay may be administratively varied to a minimum of no less than 15 feet, based upon the following: 
                  a.  Applicant may submit a variance application to the department for administrative approval by the director; 
                  b.  An administrative variance shall be issued if the following conditions are satisfied; 
                  1.  The spirit and intent of the overlay is otherwise achieved by the reduced landscape strip; 
                  2.  That for every linear foot of requested variance, the applicant shall be required to contribute landscaping recompense funds for expenditure on rights-of-way beautification within the Coal Mountain Overlay District; 
                  3.  For every linear foot of requested variance, a recompense multiplier of four times (4x) shall be applied; 
                  4.  The calculation for landscaping recompense shall be based upon the following model. [The required 20-foot landscaping strip per the overlay is estimated to cost $50.00 per linear foot. If an applicant has 100 feet of frontage, then it is estimated that landscaping will cost $5,000.00 to install ($50.00 × 100). If an applicant seeks a five-foot variance along the entire frontage, thereby reducing the landscape strip from 20 feet to 15 feet (a 25 percent reduction), this would equate to $12.5 in landscaping savings ($50.00 × 0.25). Applying the four times (4x) multiplier to $12.5 yields a $50.00 per linear foot recompense contribution for the frontage, thereby requiring the applicant to recompense the county $5,000.00 ($50.00 × 100 feet), in addition to installing the 15-foot landscaping strip along the frontage. Under this hypothetical scenario, the result would be an estimated cost of $3,750.00 to install the 15 feet of landscaping along the frontage ($37.5 × 100), as well as a $5,000.00 recompense contribution to the county, resulting in a total expenditure of $8,750.00.] 
                  5.  If a variance is sought that would reduce the landscape strip to less than 15 feet, then that additional variance reduction must be pursued in accord with those procedures set forth in sections 8-6.3 and 8-6.4 of the UDC, respectively.
