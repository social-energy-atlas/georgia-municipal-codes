PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE Part I of this volume contains the Charter and Related Laws of the City of Moultrie, Georgia, as amended, and a comparative table setting forth in chronological sequence the disposition of each act amending or relating to the Charter of the City, whether or not included in this publication. Part II contains a revision and codification of the ordinances, resolutions and motions of a general and permanent nature of the City of Moultrie, which were deemed appropriate to be included. 
Part II is an entire new codification, and, as expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, supersedes all ordinances not included herein or expressly saved from repeal by the Adopting Ordinance. Only those ordinances, resolutions or motions of a general and permanent nature prescribed for and affecting the public as a whole are included herein. Special ordinances, resolutions or motions dealing with only a portion of the inhabitants of the City, rather than all of them, or relating to special purposes, such as those levying special assessments, providing for bond issues, paving, vacating and opening specified streets, rezoning certain designated districts, etc., are not included herein. For a more specific enumeration of the type of ordinances which are not included herein see Section 3 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
The material in Part II, Code, has been classified as to subject matter. As will be noted, the chapters have been arranged conveniently in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been appropriately catchlined to facilitate usage. Attention is also invited to the footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which also refer to relevant provisions of general state law. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as chapter 12.5 or new chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

                  Actuarial equivalent or actuarial equivalence means, with respect to a benefit calculated under this plan, any benefit that has the same present value on the date the benefit payment commences, using a seven percent interest rate per annum and the unisex mortality table in effect on the date benefits commence, as proscribed by the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service for purposes of Code Section 417(e)(3). Effective prior to January 1, 2010, the plan used a seven percent interest rate per annum and a 50 percent and 50 percent blend of the 1983 Group Annuity Table for males and females. 
                  Authorized leave of absence means any temporary layoff or any absence authorized by the employer under the employer's standard personnel practices provided that all persons under similar circumstances must be treated alike in the granting of such authorized leaves of absence and provided further that the participant returns within the period of authorized absence. An absence due to service in the Armed Forces of the United States shall be considered an authorized leave of absence to the extent required by federal law. 
                  Average monthly compensation means the average of the participant's compensation over the 36 consecutive months within the most recent ten-year period of service which produces the highest such average; provided however if an employee has not been employed continuously in service, his separate periods of service will be aggregated for purposes of this section as if he has been employed in service continuously during such aggregated period. If the employee's aggregated period of service is less than three years as of his date of termination of employment, his average monthly compensation will be determined as his average monthly compensation for his entire period of service. The following rules shall be applied to determine a participant's average monthly compensation: 
                  (1)  Only compensation earned or deemed to have been earned during a period for which the participant is receiving service or is an eligible employee may be counted towards average monthly compensation. 
                  (2)  Compensation shall be counted in the year paid, even if earned in a prior year. 
                  (3)  Only compensation earned or deemed to have been earned before January 1, 2018, may be counted towards average monthly compensation. No compensation earned on or after January 1, 2018, shall be taken into account in determining a participant's accrued benefit under the plan. 
                  Beneficiary means any individual(s), trust, estate or other entity or entities designated by the participant in accordance with procedures established by the plan administrator to receive any death benefits under the plan. Any beneficiary designation shall be void if the participant revokes the designation. If a married participant fails to designate a beneficiary, or if the designated non-spouse primary beneficiary fails to survive the participant and the participant has not designated a contingent beneficiary, or if both the designated non-spouse primary beneficiary and contingent beneficiary fail to survive the participant, the beneficiary shall be (a) the participant's eligible spouse, or; (b) if no eligible spouse is alive, the participant's eligible dependent(s), or (c) if no eligible dependents, the participant's estate. If an unmarried participant fails to designate a beneficiary, or if the designated beneficiary fails to survive the participant and the participant has not designated a contingent beneficiary, or if both the designated beneficiary and contingent beneficiary fail to survive the participant, the beneficiary shall be the participant's eligible dependents, if any, and if none, the participant's estate. 
                  For the purposes of this section, revocation of prior beneficiary designations will occur when a participant files a new valid designation with the plan administrator. 
                  Nothing in this definition of beneficiary shall be interpreted to allow a participant to designate a beneficiary, or to be entitled to a death benefit, that is not otherwise provided under the terms of this plan. 
                  Board means the board of trustees of the plan. 
                  City means the City of Moultrie, Georgia.

                  Except with respect to qualified participants (as defined below), in no event shall the compensation of a participant taken into account under the plan for any plan year exceed (i)$200,000.00 for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1989, (ii) $150,000.00 for plan years on or after the later of (a) January 1, 1996 or (b) the 90th day after the opening of the first legislative session that begins on or after January 1, 1996, or (iii) for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2002, the limitations of Code Section 401(a)(17) in effect as of the beginning of the plan year (i.e., $265,000.00 for 2015). For purposes of applying the $150,000.00 limit for the 1996 plan year, if any employee is the spouse or a lineal descendant of an employee (provided the lineal descendant is younger than age 19 by the end of the plan year) who is one of the ten "highly compensated employees" (within the meaning of Code Section 414(q)) paid the greatest amount of earnings (determined without regard to the $150,000.00 limit, as adjusted) during the plan year, the employee shall not be treated as a separate employee. 
                  The limitations set forth in the preceding paragraph shall be subject to adjustment annually as provided in Code Section 401(a)(17)(B) and Code Section 415(d); provided, however, that the dollar increase in effect on January 1 of any calendar year, if any, is effective for the plan year. 
                  The limit described in the previous paragraphs shall not apply to any qualified participant. A qualified participant is any participant who first became a participant in the plan before January 1, 1996. 
                  The plan year limitations in effect as of the beginning of the plan year in which each 12-month period used to determine average monthly compensation begins shall apply to compensation paid during such 12-month period.

A defined term, such as "retirement," will normally govern the definitions of derivatives therefrom, such as "retire," even though such derivatives are not specifically defined and even if they are or are not initially capitalized. Singular and plural nouns and pronouns shall be interchangeable as the factual context may allow or require.

                  (2)  Vesting on normal retirement. A participant who attains normal retirement age while in active employment with an employer shall become 100 percent vested in his accrued benefit as of such date.

                  (2)  Amount of early retirement income. The retirement income payable to a participant who elects early retirement shall be determined in the same manner as his normal retirement benefit calculated as described above, but reduced by zero and five-twelfths percent for each month by which the participant's early retirement date precedes his normal retirement date to take into account the participant's younger age and the earlier commencement of retirement income payments. 
                  (3)  Rule of 80. Notwithstanding section (b)(1) above, effective between September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2017 only, the retirement income payable to a participant who retires before his normal retirement age but on or after the age at which the sum of the participant's age plus his number of years of service equals 80 or more, shall be determined in the same manner as his normal retirement benefit calculated as described above, unreduced. 
                  (c)  Late retirement date. 
                  (1)  Eligibility. Any participant who attains his normal retirement age may remain in the active employ of the employer beyond his normal retirement age and may postpone his retirement income payments until a later date; provided however, that a participant may not postpone receipt of his retirement income beyond the required beginning date as set forth in section 2-151(e). Such retirement shall be known as the participant's late retirement date and is payable in the form described in section 2-151. 
                  (2)  Amount of late retirement income. The retirement income payable to a participant who retires on his late retirement date shall be the sum of a., b. and c. defined below: 
                  a.  The participant's normal retirement income; and 
                  b.  An actuarial adjustment for the plan year which includes the participant's normal retirement date and each plan year thereafter as determined in (3) below; and 
                  c.  The excess, if any of the additional benefit accrual earned after the participant's normal retirement date during the plan year which includes his normal retirement date and during each plan year thereafter, over the actuarial adjustment for each such plan year respectively. 
                  (3)  Actuarial adjustment. The actuarial adjustment will be determined as of the close of each plan year and will be equal to the increase in the participant's monthly retirement income as of the close of the preceding plan year (or the participant's normal retirement date, if later) which is required in order to provide a monthly benefit as of the determination date that is the actuarial equivalent of the monthly benefit as of the close of the preceding plan year (or the participant's normal retirement date, if later). 
                  (d)  Vested termination benefit. 
                  (1)  Ten year cliff vesting provision. A participant who terminates employment for any reason other than retirement but after completing ten years of service shall be entitled to the monthly retirement income equal to the normal retirement income earned by the participant determined in accordance with section 2-149(a) hereof but using the participant's compensation and service as of his termination of employment. Such benefit shall be referred to herein as a vested termination benefit and shall be payable in the form described in section 2-151. A participant who terminates employment with the employer for any reason other than retirement and before completing ten years of service shall not be entitled to receive any retirement income under this plan (other than a return of participant contributions as provided in (3) below). 
                  (2)  Commencement of retirement income for vested terminated participants. 
                  a.  Commencement at normal retirement age. A vested terminated participant's retirement income shall commence as of his normal retirement date, unless the participant is eligible for and elects early commencement of his retirement income as provided in b. below. 
                  b.  Commencement before or after normal retirement age. A terminated participant generally may elect to convert his vested termination benefit into an early retirement income or late retirement income which is payable either before or after his normal retirement date, respectively, in accordance with section 2-149(b) and section 2-149(c), provided he has met any age or service requirement set forth therein. 
                  (3)  Return of contributions. If a participant has a termination of employment before earning at least ten years of service he shall receive a mandatory distribution of his participant contributions, plus interest. If such participant contributions plus interest are less than $5,000.00, they shall be returned to the participant in a single lump sum payment as of his termination of employment or as soon as practical thereafter. If such participant contributions plus interest are equal to or greater than $5,000.00, they shall be returned to the participant in a single lump sum payment as of the one-year anniversary of the participant's termination of employment or as soon as practical thereafter. If a participant has a termination of employment at least 15 years prior to his normal retirement age, the participant will receive a one-time election to receive an immediate lump sum distribution of his participant contributions, plus interest and forgo any other benefits under the plan, upon such termination of employment. Such distribution shall be made within 90 days of the termination of employment or as soon as practical thereafter. 
                  (4)  Forfeiture. Benefits under the plan may be reduced or forfeited to the extent permitted under O.C.G.A. §§ 47-1-20 through 47-1-25, if the participant is convicted of a public employment, drug related or other covered crime. 
                  (e)  Disability. A participant who terminates employment due to a disability, after completing ten years of service, shall receive a monthly retirement income equal to the normal retirement income determined as of his termination of employment beginning as of the first day of the month following his determination of disability. Such disability benefit may be paid in an optional form, as elected by the participant in accordance with section 2-151(c) of the plan. 
                  (f)  Restoration of service. 
                  (1)  Reemployment before becoming vested. If a participant has a termination of employment before earning at least ten years of service and is rehired by an employer, his years of service attributable to the previous period of employment shall be ignored unless he repays within one year of rehire all participant contributions plus interest that he received from the plan. 
                  (2)  Reemployment after becoming vested. If a participant has a termination of employment after earning at least ten years of service and is rehired by an employer, his years of service attributable to the previous period of employment shall be restored unless prior to rehire, the participant received all amounts due under the plan. In such a case, if the participant repays the entire distribution plus interest to the plan within one year of rehire, all his years of service shall be restored. 
                  (Ord. No. 2010-90, § 4, 12-7-2010; Ord. No. 2011-105, § 2, 9-20-2011; Ord. No. 2014-142, § 2, 2-4-2014; Ord. No. 2016-177, § 4, 1-5-2016; Ord. No. 2017-183, § 2, 3-7-2017; Ord. No. 2017-190, § 4, 10-17-2017) 
                  Sec. 2-150. - Death benefits. 
                  (a)  Pre-retirement survivor annuity. If a participant's employment terminates on account of his death after he is eligible for a vested termination benefit, an early retirement income, normal retirement income or late retirement income, but before benefits have begun, his eligible spouse or eligible dependents(s) shall be eligible to receive a monthly retirement income known as a pre-retirement survivor annuity. A participant who attains at least age 55 prior to his death may make an election to have the pre-retirement survivor annuity paid to his or her beneficiary in an amount equal to the survivor portion of a 50 percent joint and survivor annuity, or the survivor portion of a 100 percent joint and survivor annuity. If a participant has made no such election prior to his death then the pre-retirement survivor annuity shall equal 50 percent of the monthly retirement income the participant would have received if he terminated employment the date before his death. Pre-retirement death benefits shall be payable as of the first day of each month coincident or next following the participant's date of death and shall be payable to the eligible spouse or to the eligible dependent(s) in equal shares to each eligible dependent. 
                  (b)  Return of participant contributions. If a participant dies before meeting the requirements of section 2-150(a) above, his designated beneficiary shall be entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to his participant contributions plus interest. 
                  (c)  Death after retirement. If a participant's employment terminates on account of his death after his retirement income has commenced in the normal form, the participant's designated beneficiary shall receive a benefit equal to the excess of any of the total participant contributions plus interest over the total payments made to the participant as of his date of death. If a participant's employment terminates on account of his death after his retirement income has commenced in an optional form, his beneficiary shall receive the benefits determined under the option selected. 
                  (Ord. No. 2010-90, § 5, 12-7-2010; Ord. No. 2014-142, § 3, 2-4-2014; Ord. No. 2016-177, § 5, 1-5-2016) 
                  Sec. 2-151. - Payment of benefits; optional forms of retirement income. 
                  (a)  Payment of retirement income. 
                  (1)  Monthly payments. The retirement income payable for normal, early or late retirement shall be payable on the first day of each month and shall begin on the normal, early or late retirement date as applicable; provided however, a participant will not be considered to have retired and will not be eligible to commence receipt of benefits of his early retirement income as long as he continues to be employed by the employer or if he is reemployed by the employer (prior to his normal retirement date) within 90 days of his termination of employment. 
                  (2)  Benefit commencement date. Normal, early or late retirement income payments shall not commence earlier that the first day of the month following the date on which the participant's complete application for a benefit is filed at the office of the plan administrator; provided however, payment must commence by the required beginning date. 
                  (3)  Death of participant before payments begin. If a participant dies before his retirement income payments are effective, no benefits shall be payable under the plan except as provided in section 2-150. 
                  (b)  Normal form of payment. The normal form of payment shall be a life annuity option, which is a monthly retirement income payable to the participant during the participant's lifetime, with payments ceasing upon the participant's death. All benefit formulas in this plan shall give the amount of the participant's retirement income if it is paid in the life annuity option, beginning at the participant's normal retirement date. 
                  (c)  Optional forms of payment. 
                  (1)  Optional forms available. A participant may elect to receive any of the optional forms of payment listed below, in lieu of the normal form of payment. The selection of an optional form of benefit shall be final and binding upon the participant and his beneficiary on the date the participant's retirement income commences, except as otherwise provided below. 
                  a.  One hundred and twenty months certain and life option. This is a reduced monthly retirement income equal to the actuarial equivalent of the life annuity option. The retirement income shall be payable to the participant during his lifetime and, in the event of the participant's death within a period of 120 months after the commencement of benefits, the same monthly amount shall be payable to the participant's beneficiary for the remainder of such 120 month period. 
                  b.  Joint and survivor annuity option. This is a reduced monthly retirement income equal to the actuarial equivalent of the life annuity option. The retirement income shall be payable to the participant for his life, and upon the participant's death, a designated percentage (100 percent, 66 ⅔ percent, 50 percent as elected by the participant) of the participant's retirement income shall be payable to the participant's beneficiary for the beneficiary's life. Such retirement income shall cease on the later of the death of the participant or the death of the participant's beneficiary. 
                  c.  Death of beneficiary. If the participant's beneficiary or joint annuitant dies before the participant's retirement income begins, any optional form elected by the participant will be cancelled and the participant will receive retirement income in the normal form unless the participant makes a new election for an optional form with a new beneficiary or joint annuitant. 
                  d.  Social Security option. This is an increased monthly retirement income equal to the actuarial equivalent of the life annuity option. The retirement income shall be payable to the participant for his life until his social security benefits commence and a reduced retirement income payable thereafter for his life, so that combined social security benefits and retirement income payments are essentially level. 
                  e.  Death [of] the participant and beneficiary. If both the participant and the beneficiary die after the date the participant's retirement income payment becomes effective but before full payment has been made, any guaranteed payment shall be paid to a contingent beneficiary and if the commuted value of the remaining payments is less than $5,000.00, such payment shall automatically be made in a lump sum. 
                  (2)  Lump sum option. If the present value of the total amount due to the participant or beneficiary is $10,000.00 or less, the participant or beneficiary may elect to receive payment in a single lump sum payment. 
                  (3)  Minimum distribution incidental benefit rules. Any optional form of benefit elected by the participant must comply with the minimum distribution incidental benefit requirement of proposed Treasury Regulation § 1.401(a)(9)-2. This rule insures that the retirement benefits payable under the plan are more than incidental. 
                  (d)  Small lump sum payments. If the monthly amount of the total retirement income (including that of a pre-retirement survivor annuity or disability payment) to be paid is less than $100.00 per month as of the date the retirement income payments are first effective or as of the date of death of the participant, then the single sum actuarial equivalent of such retirement income shall be paid in a lump sum to the participant or beneficiary, as applicable without their consent. 
                  (e)  Special distribution rules (including age 70½ rules). 
                  (1)  Commencement of distribution at normal retirement age. Payment of retirement income shall commence no later than the 60th day after the latest of the close of the plan year in which occurs: 
                  a.  The participant's 65 birthday; 
                  b.  The tenth anniversary of the date the participant commenced participation in this plan; or 
                  c.  The participant's termination of employment. 
                  (2)  Commencement at required beginning date. Notwithstanding (e)(1) above, distribution to a participant shall commence not later than the Required beginning date. The required beginning date shall be April 1 of the calendar year following the later of (i) the calendar year in which the participant attains age 70½ or (ii) the calendar year in which the participant terminates employment. 
                  (3)  Effective date. The rules set forth in this section 2-151(e) shall apply for purposes of determining the required minimum distribution to participants and designated beneficiaries (as defined below) for calendar years beginning on and after January 1, 2003 even if, in the case of a designated beneficiary, the participant died before 2003. 
                  (4)  No extension of death benefits or payment forms. Nothing in this section 2-151(e) shall be deemed to extend any death benefit or permit any beneficiary designation or payment form not otherwise provided or permitted under this plan. This section 2-151(e) shall, instead, be deemed to limit and modify any provision of this plan to the extent that such limitation or modification is necessary to ensure that the plan complies with this section 2-151(e), Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations thereunder. 
                  For purposes of this section 2-151(e), distributions are considered to begin on the participant's required beginning date. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the Participant before the participant's required beginning date, or to the participant's spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under section 2-151(e)(7)b below, the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
                  (5)  Period of distribution. The entire interest of each participant in this plan will be distributed, beginning not later than the required beginning date described in paragraph (2) above, over the life of such participant or over the lives of such participant and his or her designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such participant or the life expectancy of such participant and his or her designated beneficiary. 
                  (6)  Death of participant after distribution has begun. If distribution of a participant's interest has begun in accordance with paragraph (2) above (i.e., distributions on or after the required beginning date), and if the participant dies before his entire interest has been distributed to him, then the remaining portion of such interest will be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used under paragraph (2) as of the date of the participant's death. 
                  (7)  Death of participant before distribution has begun. If a participant dies before distribution of the participant's interest has begun in accordance with paragraph (2) above (i.e., no distributions have been made on or after the required beginning date), the entire interest of the participant must be paid over whichever of the following periods is applicable: 
                  a.  If one or more designated beneficiary(ies) is not the participant's spouse, the distribution period shall be the designated beneficiary's remaining life expectancy. 
                  b.  If the sole designated beneficiary is the participant's spouse, the distribution period shall be the spouse's remaining life expectancy. 
                  c.  If there is no designated beneficiary, the entire account shall be distributed by the end of the calendar year that includes the fifth anniversary of the participant's death. 
                  Distributions under this subsection (e)(7) shall commence as follows: 
                  i.  Distributions under 2-151(e)(7)(a.), (i.e., distribution to a non-spouse designated beneficiary) shall begin on or before the end of the calendar year that begins immediately after the calendar year in which the participant died. 
                  ii.  Distributions under section 2-151(e)(7)(b.) (i.e., distribution solely to a spousal designated beneficiary) shall begin on or before the later of the end of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died and the end of the calendar year in which the participant would have attained age 70½. 
                  (8)  Form of distribution. For a participant who is employed by an employer after his required beginning date, any distribution payable under this section 2-151(e) may be paid in any optional form of benefit that is available under the plan, provided that all consent requirements under the plan are satisfied. Any form of distribution payable under this plan, however, must satisfy the following requirements: 
                  a.  The distribution must be in the form of a periodic annuity for the participant's life, or for the joint life expectancy of the participant and designated beneficiary or over a period certain that does not exceed the maximum length of the period certain determined under the regulations. 
                  b.  The interval between payments must be uniform over the entire distribution period and must not exceed one year. 
                  c.  If payments have commenced over a period certain, the period certain may not be changed. 
                  d.  Distributions in the form of a life annuity must satisfy the minimum distribution incidental benefit (MDIB) requirement of Code Section 401(a)(9)(G) and Treasury Regulation 1.401(a)(9)-6, A-1, or any successor regulation thereto. 
                  e.  All payments, either in the form of a life annuity or over a period certain must either be nonincreasing or increase only in accordance with the rules set forth in Treasury Regulation 1.401(a)(9)-6, A-1. 
                  f.  Unless the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with this section 2-151(e). If the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations. 
                  For purposes of this section 2-151(e), references to a life annuity shall include an annuity for the joint life expectancy of the participant and the designated beneficiary. 
                  (9)  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the participant's required beginning date (or, if the participant dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under subsection 2-151(e)(7)(a.) or (b.) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., bi-monthly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually. All of the Participant's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the participant's required beginning date. 
                  (10)  Lump sum distributions. In the case of a lump sum distribution from this plan that is distributed in or after the calendar year in which the participant attains or would have attained age 70½, the amount of the lump sum that equals the participant's or designated beneficiary's required minimum distribution and thus is not an eligible rollover distribution within the meaning of section 2-151(h) of the plan shall be determined using either of the methods set forth in the regulations. The plan administrator shall have the sole discretion to elect the calculation method but shall apply the same method to all lump sum distributions made in the same calendar year. 
                  (11)  Incidental death benefit requirement. Any optional form of benefit elected by the participant or designated beneficiary must comply with the minimum distribution incidental benefit requirement of Code Section 401(a)(9)(G). This rule insures that the retirement benefits payable under the plan are more than incidental. If the participant's interest is being distributed in the form of a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the participant and a non-spouse beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or after the participant's required beginning date to the designated beneficiary after the participant's death must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for such period that would have been payable to the participant using the table set forth in QandA-2 of Section 1.401(a)(9)-6 of the Treasury regulations. 
                  (12)  Actuarial increase after age 70½. 
                  a.  A participant's accrued benefit shall be actuarially increased to take into account the period after age 70½ in which the employee does not receive any benefits under the plan. The actuarial increase shall commence on April 1 following the calendar year in which the employee attains age 70½, and end on the date on which benefits commence after retirement in an amount sufficient to satisfy Code Section 401(a)(9). 
                  The accrued benefit payable to such a participant as of the end of the period for which the actuarial increase is required shall not be less than: 
                  i.  The actuarial equivalent of the employee's accrued benefit as of April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant attained age 70½, plus 
                  ii.  The actuarial equivalent of any additional benefits accrued after the date described in (i) above, less 
                  iii.  The actuarial equivalent of any distributions made with respect to the participant's accrued benefit after such date. 
                  b.  The actuarial increase described above may reduce the benefit accrual otherwise required under Code Section 411(b)(1)(H)(i). 
                  c.  The actuarial adjustment described above shall be made even during a period for which benefits are suspended pursuant to section 2-152. 
                  (13)  Plan administrator's discretion. The plan administrator shall have the sole authority and full discretion to apply the provisions of this section 2-151(e) to any benefit option elected by the participant. The plan administrator may, for example, modify a participant's selection of an optional form of benefit to satisfy the incidental death benefit requirement by requiring, at its discretion, that the participant select another form of benefit or another contingent annuitant, or by modifying the form of benefit so that it complies with the applicable rules. 
                  (14)  Definitions. The following definitions shall apply to this section 2-151(e) notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary. 
                  a.  Designated beneficiary. The term "designated beneficiary" shall be determined in accordance with the definition of "beneficiary" in the regulations, notwithstanding that this definition may be different from that set forth elsewhere in this plan, provided that any individual who is a designated beneficiary must also be a beneficiary (but not necessarily all of the Beneficiaries) as defined in this plan. Each Beneficiary, as defined in the plan, however, need not be a designated beneficiary in the event, for example, that a beneficiary disclaims his interest under this plan. 
                  b.  Spouse. "Spouse" shall mean "spouse" as defined in the regulations. Nothing in this section 2-151(e) shall be deemed, however, to extend any death benefit or permit any beneficiary designation or payment form not otherwise provided or permitted under this plan. 
                  c.  Regulations . "Regulations" shall refer to the Treasury Regulations (including temporary regulations) promulgated under Code Section 401(a)(9), as set forth in Treasury Regulations 1.401(a)(9)-1 through 1.401(a)(9)-6, and any additional guidance issued by the IRS in the form of revenue rulings, notices, other regulations and other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin or any successor thereto. 
                  d.  Distribution calendar year. "Distribution calendar year" is a calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year that contains the participant's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to subsection 2-151(e)(7)(i) and (ii). 
                  e.  Life expectancy. "Life expectancy" shall mean the period computed by the use of the single life table in section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the regulations. 
                  (f)  Small payments. Effective as to distributions that occur on and after January 1, 2006, if (i) the amount of a distribution is more than $1,000.00, and (ii) the participant does not affirmatively elect to receive the distribution directly or to have such distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan pursuant to section 2-151(h), then the plan administrator will pay the distribution in a direct rollover to an individual retirement plan designated by the plan administrator. 
                  (g)  Payment to minors and incapacitated persons. If any amount is payable to a minor or to any person who, in the judgment of the plan administrator, is incapable of making proper disposition thereof, such payment shall be made for the benefit of such minor or such person in any of the following ways as the plan administrator, in its sole discretion, shall determine: 
                  (1)  By payment to the legal representative of such minor or such person; 
                  (2)  By payment directly to such minor or such person; 
                  (3)  By payment in discharge of bills incurred by or for the benefit of such minor or such person. The board shall make such payments as directed by the plan administrator without the necessary intervention of any guardian or like fiduciary, and without any obligation to require bond or to see to the further application of such payment. Any payment so made shall be in complete discharge of the plan's obligation to the participant and his beneficiaries. 
                  (h)  Direct Rollover. 
                  (1)  Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the plan administrator, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
                  (2)  Definitions. 
                  a.  Eligible rollover distribution. An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include (i) any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; (ii) any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Code Section 401(a)(9); and (iii) for distributions before January 1, 2002, the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities.) The plan administrator may prohibit a distributee's election of a direct rollover with respect to an eligible rollover distribution during the plan year that is less than $200.00. If the distributee elects to have only a portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid to an eligible retirement plan, the plan administrator may require that portion to equal at least $500.00. 
                  b.  Eligible retirement plan. An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in Code Section 408(a), an individual retirement annuity described in Code Section 408(b), an annuity plan described in Code Section 403(a), a qualified trust described in Code Section 401(a), an annuity contract described in Code Section 403(b), and an eligible plan under Code Section 457(b) that is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state that agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan, provided that such account, annuity, contract, plan or trust accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. Effective as of January 1, 2008, eligible retirement plan shall include a Roth IRA established under Code Section 408A. 
                  c.  Distributee. A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Code Section 414(p), are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse. For distributions on and after January 1, 2007, "distributee" shall include a non-spouse beneficiary of an eligible rollover distribution to the extent permitted by Code Section 402(c)(11). 
                  d.  Direct rollover. A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
                  e.  Special rules for rollovers of after-tax contributions. To the extent that an eligible rollover distribution includes amounts that are not includible in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities), such an amount shall constitute an eligible rollover distribution to the extent that (i) it is transferred in a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to a qualified trust or to an annuity contract described in Code Section 403(b), and such trust or contract provides for separate accounting for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution that is not so includible, or (ii) such portion is transferred to an individual retirement account described in Code Section 408(a) or an individual retirement annuity described in Code Section 408(b) (other than an endowment contract).

                  Sec. 2-152. - Suspension of benefits. 
                  (a)  This section 2-152 shall apply to any participant who (i) retired or otherwise terminated employment under the provisions of this plan (ii) is receiving, has received, or was entitled to receive retirement income hereunder, and (iii) returns to employment with the employer. Such participant shall be subject to the following provisions: 
                  (1)  The participant shall not be entitled to receive during such period of reemployment any retirement income to which the participant might otherwise be entitled under this plan; provided, however, that retirement income for a given calendar month will not be suspended if the participant has attained his normal retirement age. 
                  (2)  The participant shall be treated like any other participant who terminated employment and was rehired (ignoring the fact that he may have retired and was receiving retirement income) and, to the extent provided in section 2-149(f), shall be given credit for service earned after reemployment and prior to his subsequent retirement. The period during which he was retired or was not employed by the employer shall not be included as service unless otherwise required by section 2-149(f). 
                  (3)  If the participant dies during the time of his reemployment and such participant has previously received retirement income, then any death benefit to which the participant's beneficiary shall be entitled shall be determined under the form of payment previously elected by the participant pursuant to section 2-151 and computed as described in subparagraph (4) below. If the participant had not previously received retirement income, then any death benefit shall be determined under section 2-150 of the plan (with the participant's accrued benefit first recomputed under subparagraph (4) below). 
                  (4)  The retirement income payable on the participant's subsequent termination of employment shall be made under the form of payment in effect (if any) prior to his reemployment and shall equal the greatest of a, b, or c below. 
                  a.  The retirement income payable to the participant shall be determined in accordance with section 2-149 based upon his compensation before his prior termination of employment and after his rehire (to the extent permitted under the definition of compensation) and by aggregating his service before his prior termination of employment with his service after his rehire. The retirement income so determined shall be reduced by the actuarial equivalent of any retirement income previously paid to the participant. 
                  b.  If the participant's subsequent termination of employment occurs after the participant's normal retirement date, the participant's monthly retirement income shall be adjusted in the manner described in section 2-149(c). 
                  c.  The monthly retirement income payable to the participant shall not be less than the monthly retirement income the participant was receiving or was entitled to receive prior to his earlier termination of employment. 
                  (Ord. No. 2010-90, § 7, 12-7-2010; Ord. No. 2016-177, § 7, 1-5-2016)

                  (a)  Employer contributions. 
                  (1)  The employer shall contribute to the trust fund from time to time such amounts as the plan administrator shall determine, based upon the recommendations of an actuary, in order to fund the benefits provided hereunder on an actuarially sound basis. All employer contributions when made to the trust fund and all property and funds of the trust fund, including income from investments and from all other sources, shall be retained for the exclusive benefit of participants and beneficiaries and shall be used to pay retirement income provided hereunder or to pay expenses of administration of the plan and the trust fund. 
                  (2)  All contributions are conditioned upon the initial qualification of the plan under Code Section 401(a). Upon an employer's request and to the extent permitted by the Code and other applicable laws and regulations thereunder, a contribution shall be returned to the employer within one year after the denial of the plan's initial qualification. Upon an employer's request and to the extent permitted by the Code and other applicable laws and regulations thereunder, a contribution which was made by a mistake in fact shall be returned to the employer within one year after the payment of the contribution. 
                  (b)  Participant contributions. 
                  (1)  Each participant shall contribute three and one-half percent of compensation until January 31, 2005, and four and two-tenths percent thereafter. 
                  (2)  Effective January 1, 2002, the participant contributions described in this section, although designated as participant contributions, are being paid by the employer as "pick-up" contributions in accordance with Code Section 414(h). As such, these contributions are mandatory and no participant is entitled under any circumstances to receive such contributions in cash in lieu of having them contributed to the plan. Such contributions shall be 100 percent vested for all purposes under the plan. 
                  (3)  Effective on and after January 1, 2018, no participant contributions shall be made to the plan. 
                  (c)  Miscellaneous. 
                  (1)  Any actuarial gains arising from actuarial experience under the plan shall be used to reduce the employer contributions and will not be used to increase any benefits payable under this plan. No forfeiture arising from severance of employment, death or for any other reason, shall be applied to increase the benefits any participant would otherwise receive under the plan at any time prior to the termination of the plan or the complete discontinuance of employer contributions hereunder, but all amounts so forfeited shall be used as soon as possible to reduce the employer contributions under the plan. 
                  (2)  No person shall have any interest in or right to the fund or any part thereof except as expressly provided in the plan. 
                  (Ord. No. 2010-90, § 8, 12-7-2010; Ord. No. 2016-177, § 8, 1-5-2016; Ord. No. 2017-190, § 5, 10-17-2017) 
                  Sec. 2-154. - Plan termination. 
                  (a)  The employer expects this plan to be continued indefinitely but reserves the right to terminate the plan and its contributions hereunder at any time by action of city council. In the event that it becomes necessary to terminate or partially terminate the plan, then the accrued benefit of each affected participant (within the meaning of Code Section 411(d)(3)), to the extent funded, shall become fully vested and non-forfeitable as of the date of such termination or partial termination in the manner hereinafter provided in this section 2-154. 
                  (b)  If the employer elects to terminate the plan, the city council shall give written notice of such fact to the board of trustees and the plan administrator for the plan. Thereafter the board and the plan administrator shall prepare a list of all participants showing for each, as of the date of plan termination, the following: 
                  (1)  The amount and payment terms of all benefits currently being paid to each participant, beneficiary and joint annuitant; 
                  (2)  The amount, payments terms and commencement date of benefits for terminated participants entitled to benefits under the plan; and, 
                  (3)  The accrued benefit of each active participant. 
                  (c)  The board shall prepare a statement of the liquidated value of the assets held in the trust fund. The employer, in its sole discretion may request the board to arrange for the liquidation of all plan assets and may direct the board to purchase fully paid-up annuity contracts to provide the benefits to which each participant, beneficiary and joint annuitant is entitled or to pay a lump sum to each such participant, beneficiary and joint annuitant equal to the actuarial equivalent of the retirement benefits to which each is entitled. 
                  (d)  If the plan assets are not sufficient to provide full benefits to each participant, beneficiary and joint annuitant, the employer shall pay to the board, as soon as practical an amount equal to the total value of benefits payable over the total value of assets held in the trust. 
                  (e)  Any residual assets of the plan remaining after distribution in accordance with the preceding paragraphs shall be distributed to the employer, provided: 
                  (1)  All liabilities of the plan to participants and beneficiaries have been satisfied; and 
                  (2)  The distribution does not contravene any provision of applicable law. 
                  (Ord. No. 2010-90, § 8, 12-7-2010; Ord. No. 2016-177, § 9, 1-5-2016)

If the annual benefit commences when the participant has fewer than ten years of participation in this plan or any predecessor plan to this plan, the $160,000.00 figure defined above shall be reduced by one-tenth for each year less than ten in accordance with applicable regulations. If the annual benefit commences when the participant has less than ten years of service with the employer, the amount represented by 100 percent of the participant's highest average compensation shall be reduced by one-tenth for each year less than ten in accordance with applicable regulations.

                  c.  Amounts realized from the sale, exchange or other disposition of stock acquired under a qualified stock option; 
                  d.  Other amounts which receive special tax benefits; and,

                  (4)  Amounts that would otherwise constitute "compensation" under (3) above but are paid from a nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan sponsored by the employer nevertheless shall constitute "compensation" for purposes of the limitations in Code Section 415 in the year in which such amounts are actually received by the participant, but only to the extent such amounts are includible in the participant's gross income. 
                  (5)  The following amounts also shall constitute "compensation" under (3) above if (a.) the amounts are paid by the later of two and one-half months after the participant's severance from employment with the employer or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the participant's severance from employment, and (b.) the amounts would have constitute compensation under (3) above if they were paid prior to the participant's severance from employment with the employer: 
                  a.  Payment for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave, but only if the participant would have been able to use the leave if employment had continued; and 
                  b.  Amounts received by a participant pursuant to a nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plan, but only if the payment would have been paid to the participant at the same time if the participant had continued in employment with the employer and only to the extent that the payment is includible in the participant's gross income.

The governing authority finds that the public interest requires that they protect against such conflicts of interest by establishing appropriate ethical standards with respect to the conduct of the members of the governing authority in situations where a conflict may exist. 
                  The purpose of this code of ethics is to: 
                  (1)  Encourage high ethical standards in official conduct by city officials; 
                  (2)  Establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all such officials by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the interest of the city; 
                  (3)  Require disclosure by such officials of private financial or other interest in matters affecting the city; and, 
                  (4)  Serve as a basis for disciplining those who refuse to abide by its terms. 
                  The provisions of this code of ethics shall be applicable to all elected or appointed city officials. 
                  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, state law and the Charter of the city shall be controlling in the event of an actual conflict with the provisions of this code of ethics. This article shall be interpreted to supplement, and not replace, said provisions of state law and the Charter.

The original of such invoice shall be delivered by the wholesaler to the retailer simultaneously with such delivery.

A copy of such invoice shall be attached to any reports required by the city. 
                  (b)  Each retail licensee doing business in the city shall keep and maintain the original invoice of each sale to him or purchased by him from a wholesaler of any spirituous liquors for at least 12 months after the date of such purchase and shall maintain records to show the sales of spirituous liquors and any other records required by the city.

                  Sec. 10-26. - Findings; public purpose. 
                  (a)  Based on the experience of other local governmental jurisdictions recognizing that the sale and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages in adult entertainment establishments produces increased criminal activity and deterioration of adjacent neighborhoods, the mayor and council of the city find that it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community to enact regulations to reduce the possible adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments. However, the mayor and council also find that the outright prohibition of such establishments could improperly infringe upon protected forms of expression. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to reasonably regulate adult entertainment establishments in a manner that serves the legitimate governmental interest of reducing criminal activity and protecting property values without unreasonably infringing upon the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and their patrons. 
                  (b)  The mayor and council has again reviewed and considered problems that other communities have experienced as a result of adult entertainment establishments operating within those jurisdictions. Included in these materials were various studies conducted by local governments on the adult entertainment issue. Reviewed by the council were studies of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Houston, Texas; and a summary of land use studies by various municipalities including but not limited to Garden Grove, California; Tucson, Arizona; Seattle, Washington; and Indianapolis, Indiana. Also reviewed were a copy of a transcript of a hearing before the Peach County Commissioners held on May 7, 1996; the article "Regulation of Adult Entertainment in Georgia: Dancing in a Mine Field" by Susan S. Cole under date of June 14, 1996; a copy of the minutes of a meeting of the city council of the City of Fort Myers, Florida, on November 22, 1993; newspaper stories relating to establishments in or near Marietta, Georgia; and recent review and passage of an ordinance by the City of Thomasville, Georgia. After such review and a public hearing on the subject, each individual member of the council is of the opinion that this article is in the best interest of the citizens of the community in an effort to avoid harmful and secondary effects known to occur in and around these types of businesses. The mayor and council, in reaffirming this article, has no intention to infringe upon the rights of any citizens to freedom of speech or expression.

                  (b)  The city may suspend or revoke any other license granted by the city of any business owner or operator as a penalty for the conviction of the business owner or business operator of a violation of the O.C.G.A. § 16-12-35(e), (f) or (g). 
                  (c)  Right to inspect and examine books and records. The city council, any member thereof, the city manager and his designee shall have the right to inspect and examine the books and records of all operators or owners of any bona fide coin operated amusement machine located within the jurisdiction of the city ages at any time during the normal hours of business operation. 
                  (d)  The suspension or revocation of licenses under this Code section shall be in accordance with the following guidelines: 
                  (1)  Notice; hearing. Any license which has been issued or which may be issued by the city to any licensee may be suspended or revoked by the mayor and council for due cause. Before the city council shall revoke or suspend any existing license, the applicant shall be given notice in writing from the city clerk to show cause before the city council at a time and place specified therein, not less than three days nor more than ten days from the date of service of the notice, why the license should not be revoked or suspended, as the case may be, stating the grounds therefore, and at the appointed time and place the licensee shall have the opportunity to show cause, if any exists, why the application should not be denied or the license revoked or suspended, after which the city council shall take such action as it, in its judgment and discretion, shall deem warranted under the facts, including suspension, probation, or revocation, and/or may impose a civil monetary penalty not to exceed the amount allowed under the city charter. The hearing herein provided for need not be at a regular meeting of the city council, but may be at such time and place as shall be fixed in the notice. All decisions suspending or revoking any license shall be in writing, with the reason therefore stated, and mailed or delivered to the applicant. In addition, at any hearing as provided herein, the party afforded the hearing shall have the opportunity to present evidence, have an attorney, to cross-examine opposing witnesses and have testimony recorded at his expense. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings under this section, although the mayor and council shall have the right to exclude evidence which carries no indicia of reliability. All testimony shall be offered under oath or affirmation. 
                  (2)  Due cause generally. The term "due cause" for the purposes of this section shall include, but not be limited to: 
                  a.  Conviction of, or the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by, the licensee or any of his employees or any person holding an interest in the license for any felony, any law, administrative regulation or ordinance involving alcoholic beverages, gambling or narcotics, or tax laws. 
                  b.  Conviction of, or the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by, the licensee or any of his employees or any person holding an interest in the license for any sex offense when the business is licensed for on-premises consumption. 
                  c.  Suspension or revocation of any state license required as a condition for the possession, sale or distribution of alcoholic beverages. 
                  d.  Revelation of any material falsification of any fact or representation given in an application for a license issued under this chapter or bearing upon the licensee's qualification therefor. Any material omission from, or untrue or misleading information which is contained in, an original, or renewal application for license hereunder shall be cause for the denial or refusal of a license, and if any license has previously been granted under such circumstances, the same shall constitute due cause for suspension or revocation of such license. Any act which may be construed as a subterfuge in an effort to circumvent any of the qualifications for a license under this chapter shall be deemed a violation of the requirement attempted to be circumvented. 
                  e.  Failure to meet or maintain any standard prescribed by this article as a condition or qualification for holding a license. 
                  f.  Due cause may also be found should the licensed establishment have become a trouble spot in the judgment of the council by reason of disturbances or acts of disorderly conduct or violence having occurred in the business or on the premises thereof; provided that when the license of any establishment has been revoked or renewal of license denied because the establishment has become a trouble spot, no further license shall be issued under this chapter to any person at the location for a period of at least 12 months from the date of revocation. 
                  g.  Due cause shall also consist of the business or the operation or location thereof of the owner or any person connected therewith ceasing to meet any of the qualifications for the issuance of license as stated in this chapter. 
                  h.  Failure to control operation resulting in public nuisance. If the failure to control the operation either inside the building or outside on the property results in controlled substance abuse, prostitution, gambling, flagrant indecent conduct or obscenity, fighting, excessive noise, loitering or illegal parking, to the number of times and extent that the city council, should find the establishment to have become a public nuisance, then such failure may be declared to be due cause for suspension or revocation of the license for such establishment, or the denial of renewal application for same. 
                  i.  Any other factor known to or discovered by the city whereby it is objectively shown the licensee, any of the licensee's employees or any person holding an interest in a license, has engaged in conduct at or involving the licensed business or has permitted conduct on the licensed premises that constitutes a violation of federal or state law, a violation of any law or ordinance regulating such business, or violation of regulations made pursuant to authority granted for the purpose of regulating such business, local ordinance or administrative regulations involving alcoholic beverages, gambling or narcotics for all alcohol licensed businesses and including any sex offense under state law or local ordinances with respect to businesses licensed for on-premises consumption, and of failure of the licensee or his employee to promptly report to the police department any violation of the law or ordinances, breach of peace, disturbance or altercation resulting in violence occurring inside the building or on the premises. With respect to this section, it shall be rebuttably presumed that the violative act was done with the knowledge or consent of the licensee; provided, however, that such presumption may be rebutted only by evidence which precludes every other reasonable hypothesis save that such licensee did not know, assist or aid in such occurrence, or in the exercise of full diligence that such licensee could not have discovered or prevented such activity. 
                  j.  Emergency due cause; failure or refusal to cooperate with police acting in line of duty. On evidence of failure or refusal of the licensee or any employee hereunder to cooperate with any police officer on any reasonable request or action within such officer's duties, responsibilities or powers, including all police powers, rights and duties to investigate to determine any pertinent fact relating to the establishment, the licensee, any employees or corporate officers or partners, the city manager or his designee shall immediately order all operation of any bona fide coin operated amusement machine discontinued until after a hearing is set out in the due cause hearing provided for in subsection (d)(1) of this section, such hearing to be concerning such failure or refusal to cooperate. 
                  (e)  Notice of suspension or revocation proceedings shall be served on the person named as licensee in the application and shall be in writing. The notice may be served personally or by first class mail. If by mail, the notice shall be addressed to the licensee at its address as provided by the licensee to the municipality. The burden shall be on the licensee to provide notice, in writing, of any change of address for service of notices and process. In the case of service by mail of any notice required by this chapter, the service is complete at the time of deposit in the United States Postal Service. 
                  (f)  Sanctions generally. Mayor and council may impose any such sanction(s), or no sanctions, in its judgment and discretion. Such sanction(s) may include one or more of the following: revocation of the license, suspension of the license for no more than 12 months, imposition of a probationary period not to exceed 12 months, and/or a civil monetary penalty not to exceed the amount allowed under the city charter. Where the remaining term of the license is less than 12 months, imposition of suspension or probation for a period in excess of the term of the existing license shall be applied to any license renewal. A subsequent violation within a probationary period shall be cause for revocation and/or denial of license renewal. A total of three separate and unrelated violations within 24 months, whether or not within a probationary period, shall be grounds for permanent revocation. 
                  (g)  Upon receipt of notice of adverse action against the licensee under this section, the licensee may waive its right to a hearing and stipulate to a sanction, as recommended by the city manager, in consultation with the chief of police. Any stipulation entered under this subsection shall be in writing, signed by the licensee, and non-appealable.

                  (a)  Occupational license. Every person, before entering upon the installation, construction, reconstruction or repair of any piping in the city's system and its gas service territory, shall be required to obtain a gasfitter's license. The city clerk shall refuse to issue a license to any person to engage in the business of gas installation and construction, unless such person holds a valid unrevoked and unsuspended certificate of competency, or has in his regular employ a person who holds such certificate. The clerk shall also refuse to any partnership a license to engage in such business unless said partnership shall have in its regular employ or as a member a person who holds such certificate. The clerk shall also refuse to issue a license to any corporation which has not in its regular employ a person who holds a certificate. Every such license shall stand suspended during any period in which the conditions requisite to issuance of a license do not pertain. Such license shall be conspicuously displayed at the holder's place of business. 
                  (b)  Bond. Before said license is issued the party applying for same shall deposit with the clerk a bond in the principal sum of $2,500.00 executed by a solvent surety company, with an agent in the city, conditioned that the principal shall faithfully comply with the terms of this article and shall indemnify and hold harmless the city and all persons interested, against all costs, expenses, damage and injury sustained by the negligence of such principal, his agents, servants and employees, or his failure to comply ethically with the terms of this article in doing work made the subject matter hereof, and otherwise to be in the form and executed as required by the mayor and council. Upon approval of any such bond by the mayor and council, the clerk shall forthwith issue to the principal therein a license which shall remain in force only so long as said principal's bond is effective. Such bond shall be renewed annually on February 1 of each year as a prerequisite to the issuance of a license for said year. 
                  (c)  Application to nonresidents. The requirements of bond and license shall apply to all persons, resident or nonresident, of the city, when doing work in the city. Provided, however, any person doing work outside of the city in its gas service territory shall be issued a permit to do such work in lieu of a license, upon the payment of a fee of $5.00 therefor but in no event shall the requirements of examination and bond be suspended.

                  Sec. 46-29. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The local issuing authority may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in paragraph (c) subsections 15. and 16. herein, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b) and published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in paragraph (b), subsection (2) of this article; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) below, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) above. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 2010-69, § 4, 1-5-2010) 
                  Sec. 46-30. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the city to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the city and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) below. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 46-29(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by four copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  A fee, in accordance with the city schedule of fees shall be charged for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area. 
                  (4)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(5)(a), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (5)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 46-29(c)(15) and (16) of this article have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(7) below have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (6)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (7)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 46-29(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices.

                  ARTICLE IV. - WETLANDS PROTECTION 

                  Sec. 46-81. - Findings and purpose. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. The wetlands within Moultrie, Georgia are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and population control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; open space; and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the State of Georgia. 
                  Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution, and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
                  The Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the Georgia Department of Community Affairs have determined that each local government with classified wetlands located in its jurisdiction must adopt a Wetlands Protection Ordinance under the requirements of House Bill 215, Georgia's 1989 Growth Strategies Legislation and the rules promulgated thereunder. 
                  It is therefore necessary for Moultrie, Georgia to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities in wetlands that may adversely affect wetlands. 
                  (b)  Title and purpose. This article shall be known as the Wetland Protection Ordinance of Moultrie, Georgia. The purposes of this article is to promote wise use of wetlands and protect wetlands, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational, and aesthetic values. Activities which may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined by a permitting process. The objective of this article is to protect wetlands from alterations which will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, ground water recharge, aesthetic nature, and wildlife areas and to comply with the requirements of state law related to wetland protection.

                  Jurisdictional wetland shall have a wetland area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  Regulated activity shall mean any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States excepting those activities exempted in section 46-83(b) of this article and exempted in Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 
                  Silviculture shall mean the art of producing, reproducing and growing a forest of distinctive stands of trees. 
                  Temporary emergency permit shall mean a temporary permit that may be issued in certain circumstances specified herein. 
                  Wetland shall mean an area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and distribution sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances does support a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, commonly known as hydrophilic vegetation.

The generalized wetland map shall be on file at the office of division of planning and safety. 
                  (b)  Wetland protection district boundaries. The generalized wetland map is a general reference document and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U. S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a Section 404 Permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not necessarily represent the exact boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of Moultrie, Georgia and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this ordinance does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.

All activities that are not exempted in subsection (b) below or by other local development ordinances, shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a local development permit. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of the wetland protection district boundary, as determined from the generalized wetland map, a U. S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present and that a Section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, a local development permit will be issued only following issuance of the Section 404 permit or letter of permission. 
                  (b)  Permissible uses (use as a right). The following uses shall be allowed as a right within the Wetland Protection District to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, drainage, or dredging except as provided herein.

                  Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet, and/or where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. 
                  Area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. In the absence of official designation by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, areas of special flood hazard shall be those designated by the local community and referenced in section 54-7. 
                  Base flood means the flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
                  Base flood elevation (BFE) means the elevation shown on the flood insurance rate map for Zones AE, AH, A1-30, AR, AR/A, AR/E, AR/A1-A30, AR/AH, AR/AO, V1-V30, and VE that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has one-percent chance of equaling or exceeding that level in any given year.

                  (3)  Emergency operation centers or data storage centers which contain records or services that may become lost or inoperative during flood and storm events; and 
                  (4)  Generating plants, and other principal points of utility lines. 
                  Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling operations, and permanent storage of materials or equipment. 
                  Elevated building means a nonbasement building built to have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns, piers, or shear walls adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a base flood event. 
                  Existing construction means any structure for which the start of construction commenced before February 17, 1987 (i.e., the effective date of the first floodplain management code or ordinance adopted by the community as a basis for that community's participation in the National Flood Insurance Program). 
                  Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before February 17, 1987 (i.e., the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community). 
                  Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads. 
                  Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
                  (1)  The overflow of inlaid or tidal waters; or 
                  (2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
                  Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Insurance Administration, where the boundaries of areas of special flood hazard have been defined as zone A. 
                  Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Insurance Administration, delineating the areas of special flood hazard and/or risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
                  Flood insurance study means the official report by the Federal Insurance Administration evaluating flood hazards and containing flood profiles and water surface elevations of the base flood. 
                  Floodplain means any land area susceptible to flooding. 
                  Floodproofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is: 
                  (1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of the Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
                  (2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district;

                  a.  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
                  b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this code. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of this chapter, the term is synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD). 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain and has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 in existing and future FEMA Modernization Maps. 
                  New construction means any structure (see definition) for which the start of construction commenced after August 2, 1977 and includes any subsequent improvements to the structure (i.e., the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the community as a basis for community participation in the National Flood Insurance Program). 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after August 2, 1977 (i.e., the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community). 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
                  (1)  Built on a single chassis; 
                  (2)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
                  (3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: Accessory structures are not exempt from any chapter requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a building, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of the building should be (i) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (ii) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions, which have been preidentified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  Sec. 54-3. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. No. 761, art. 1, § B, 9-2-1997) 
                  Sec. 54-4. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  Sec. 54-12. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
                  The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made under this chapter. 
                  (Ord. No. 761, art. 2, § G, 9-2-1997) 
                  Sec. 54-13. - Penalties for violation. 
                  (a)  Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor. 
                  (b)  Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $1,000.00 or imprisoned for not more than 100 days, or both, and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful actions as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
                  (Ord. No. 761, art. 2, § H, 9-2-1997) 
                  Sec. 54-14. - Variance procedures. 
                  (a)  The Moultrie-Colquitt County Planning Commission as established by the city council shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Moultrie-Colquitt County Planning Commission may appeal such decision to the superior court of the county, as provided in state law. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the Moultrie-Colquitt County Planning Commission shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances are as follow: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The city engineer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.

                  ARTICLE III. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 54-71. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this chapter, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components, all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include but are not limited to use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces; 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewer systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure which is not compliant with the provisions of this chapter shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
                  (Ord. No. 761, art. 4, § A, 9-2-1997) 
                  Sec. 54-72. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than two feet above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 54-71(4) pertaining to elevated buildings. All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zone may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to two feet above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 54-43(7). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved (i) on individual lots or parcels, (ii) in new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (iii) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (iv) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than two feet above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than two feet above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement (refer to subsection 54-71(6) above). 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions) and be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or 
                  2.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections 54-72(3)a. through (3)c., above. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 54-7 are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted, however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection (4)a of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article. 
                  (Ord. No. 761, art. 4, § B, 9-2-1997; Ord. No. 2009-63, § 5, 8-18-2009; Ord. No. 2010-70, § 1, 1-19-2010)

                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 54-7, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 54-7, the city engineer shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this article. Only if data are not available from these sources, then subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall apply. 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 54-71(4) pertaining to elevated buildings. The city engineer shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (4)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site.

                  Sec. 54-74. - Standards for areas of special flood hazard with established base flood elevations without designated floodways (AE zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 54-7, where streams with base flood elevations are provided but no floodways have been designated the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 
                  (2)  New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or floodproofed to elevations established in accordance with section 54-72. 
                  (Ord. No. 761, art. 4, § D, 9-2-1997; Ord. No. 2009-63, § 7, 8-18-2009) 
                  Sec. 54-75. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). 
                  Areas of special flood hazard established in section 54-7 may include designated AO shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following apply: 
                  (1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 54-71(4) pertaining to elevated buildings.

                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Business building means any structure, whether public or private, that is adapted for occupancy for transaction of business; for rendering of professional service; for amusement; for the display, sale or storage of goods, wares and merchandise; or for the performance of work or labor, including hotels, roominghouses, office buildings, public buildings, stores, theaters, markets, grain elevators, abattoirs, warehouses, workshops, factories, and all outhouses, sheds, barns, and other structures or premises used for business purposes. 
                  City health officer means the health officer of the joint city-county board of health, or by any duly authorized person who may represent him. 
                  Occupant means the individual, partnership or corporation that has the use of or occupies any business building or a part or fraction thereof, whether the actual owner or tenant. In the case of a vacant building or any portion of a business building, the owner, agent or other person having custody of the building shall have the responsibilities of an occupant of a building. 
                  Owner means the actual owner of the business building, whether individual, partnership or corporation, or the agent of the building or other person having custody of the building or to whom rent is paid. In the case of business buildings leased with a clause in the lease specifying that the lessee will be considered in such cases as the owner, he is so considered for the purpose of this division. 
                  Rat harborage means any condition which provides shelter or protection for rats, thus favoring their multiplication and continued existence in, under or outside a structure of any kind. 
                  Vent stoppage applies to a relatively inexpensive form of ratproofing to prevent the ingress of rats into business buildings, from the exterior or from one business building to another as illustrated in part by booklet entitled "Marine Typhus Fever" as published by the state department of public health. It consists essentially of the closing of all openings in the exterior walls, ground or first floors, basements, roofs, and foundations, that may be reached by rats from the ground, by climbing, or by burrowing, with material impervious to rat gnawing.

                  (2)  Failure of the commission to act within said 45 days shall constitute approval, and no other evidence of approval shall be needed. 
                  (j)  Necessary actions of commission upon rejection of application for certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (1)  In the event the commission rejects an application, it shall state its reasons for doing so, and shall transfer a record of such actions and reasons, in writing, to the applicant.

                  (2)  In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of the application for a certificate of appropriateness by the commission shall be binding upon the building inspector or other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits and, in such a case, no building permit shall be issued. 
                  (k)  Undue hardship. Where, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this chapter would result in the exceptional practical difficulty or undue hardship upon any owner of a specific property, the commission, in passing upon applications, shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to said provisions, or to interpret the meaning of said provisions, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided such variances, modifications or interpretations shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of said provisions, so that the architectural or historical integrity, or character of the property, shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variances, the commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgment, best fulfill the purpose of this chapter.

                  (o)  Acquisition of property.

                  (a)  Ordinary maintenance or repair. Ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural or environmental feature in or on a historic property to correct deterioration, decay or damage, or to sustain the existing form, and that does not involve a material change in design, material or outer appearance thereof, does not require a certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (b)  Failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair. Property owners of historic properties or properties within historic districts shall not allow their buildings to deteriorate by failing to provide ordinary maintenance or repair. The commission shall be charged with the following responsibilities regarding deterioration by neglect: 
                  (1)  The commission shall monitor the condition of historic properties and existing buildings in historic districts to determine if they are being allowed to deteriorate by neglect. Such conditions as broken windows, doors and openings which allow the elements and vermin to enter, the deterioration of exterior architectural features, or the deterioration of a building's structural system shall constitute failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair. 
                  (2)  In the event the commission determines a failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair, the commission will notify the owner of the property and set forth the steps which need to be taken to remedy the situation. The owner of such property will have 30 days in which to do this. 
                  (3)  In the event that the condition is not remedied in 30 days, the owner shall be punished as provided in section 1-9 of this Code and, at the direction of the city council, the commission may perform such maintenance or repair as is necessary to prevent deterioration by neglect. The owner of the property shall be liable for the cost of such maintenance and repair performed by the commission. 
                  (c)  Affirmation of existing building and zoning codes. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as to exempt property owners from complying with existing city or county building and zoning codes, nor to prevent any property owner from making any use of his property not prohibited by other statutes, ordinances, or regulations.

                  (b)  The council further finds that persons under the age of 17 are particularly susceptible by their lack of maturity and experience to participate in unlawful activities and/or to place themselves in situations which would increase their potential for victimization. 
                  (c)  The council further finds that a need exists for increased parental responsibility and parental control over the activities of juveniles. 
                  (d)  The council further finds that this criminal activity, both individually and collectively, presents a clear and present danger to the citizenry and to public order and safety and that an ordinance establishing a curfew for persons under the age of 17 and parental responsibility for violations of said curfew is an appropriate method of addressing the foregoing issues. 
                  (e)  Therefore, the purpose of this article is to: 
                  (1)  Protect juveniles themselves and other citizens from the dangers of crimes which occur on sidewalks, streets, and in public and semipublic places during late night and early morning hours; 
                  (2)  Decrease the amount of criminal activity committed by juveniles; and 
                  (3)  Promote and enhance parental control over juveniles.

The city manager, through the public works department, and by implementing and enforcing the provisions of these regulations, is authorized and directed to control the storage, collection, transportation, and disposal of all refuse within the city. The regulations contained in this chapter shall apply to the storage, collection, transportation, and disposal of refuse in the city by private haulers, as well as by the public works department.

All property shall be free of litter, garbage, household debris, rubbish, scrap tires, old cars or parts, household appliances, and weeds, undergrowth, brush or other matter which by reason of height, proximity to neighboring structures, physical condition, filth or habitat for reptiles, animals, and insects, shall be deemed by the city to be unsanitary, unhealthy or hazardous. Provided however, that this section shall not prohibit the storage of litter in authorized private receptacles for collection.

Such notice may be given by personal service, certified mail or posting the property in a conspicuous manner. 
                  (2)  Upon the failure, neglect, or refusal of any owner, occupant, person in control or any agent thereof, so notified, to properly abate said condition within the ten days receipt of the notice or such notices return due to inability to make certified delivery or the posting of the property, unless a hearing is requested in writing addressed to the clerk of municipal court by the person receiving the notice, the city is hereby authorized and empowered to clean said property and abate any conditions deemed unsanitary, unhealthy or hazardous. 
                  (3)  If an affected party requests a hearing as set forth in (2) above, the clerk of municipal court shall summon all affected parties to show cause before the judge of Moultrie Municipal Court at the time specified therein, not less than four nor more than 20 days from the date thereof, why the alleged condition should not be abated. The court shall hear evidence as to the facts and render judgment therein according to said facts and the law of the case. If the thing complained of be dangerous to the public health, safety or welfare, the judgment of the court shall so specify and shall thereon fix the time not more than ten days from the date of said judgment when said condition shall be abated by the affected parties.

The recordation of such sworn statement shall constitute a lien on the property, and shall remain in full force and effect for the amount due in principal and interest, plus cost of court, reasonable attorney fees, for collection, until final payment has been made. Sworn statements recorded shall be prima facie evidence that all legal requirements have been complied with and that the work has been done properly and shall be in full notice to every person concerned that the amount of the statement, plus interests and costs, constitutes a charge against the property designated or described in the statement and that the same is due and collectible as provided by law. A fi. fa. shall be issued, executed, prosecuted, levied, and sales conducted thereunder as in the case of fi. fas. for the collection of ad valorem taxes of the city. 
                  (c)  In addition, every violation of this article shall be punishable as follows by the issuance of citation:

After January 1, 2008, the cost of the initial installation of the 55-gallon drum liner, including hinged lid assembly, shall be funded as a solid waste general operating expense and shall be installed by the public works department, while the 32-gallon bail handle garbage can shall be paid for by the resident/tenant of the property for a fee pursuant to the service fee schedule maintained by the city. The 55-gallon drum liner, including hinged lid assembly, shall be the property of the City of Moultrie while the 32-gallon bail handle garbage can shall be the property of the resident/tenant of the property.

The 32-gallon roll-away container shall be the residential garbage container used where a 32-gallon in-ground container would normally be used as noted above, but in the opinion of the public works department, an in-ground container would be impractical due to high subsurface water levels or a lack of installation space. This type of roll-away container shall be delivered by and be the property of the City of Moultrie.

                  e.  Community dumpster. This permanent container consists of either a six- or eight-cubic-yard container. The community dumpster shall be the residential garbage container used where residents live in a complex, and where, in the opinion of the public works department, such a container shall be more practical than individual containers. This type container shall be delivered by and be the property of the City of Moultrie.

The dumpster shall be the normal commercial garbage container used for larger volume commercial customers and where, in the opinion of the public works department, such a container shall be more practical than 96-gallon roll-away containers.

                  (3)  Number of containers. The public works department, using periodic garbage volume surveys, shall determine the number of garbage containers needed per commercial business. A commercial customer may use a maximum of four 96-gallon roll-away containers before being required to use a dumpster unless, in the opinion of the public works department, a customer shall be better served by 96-gallon roll-away containers.

                  (a)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section 110-330 of this article. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 110-326, 110-328 and 110-329 of this article. 
                  (b)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (a) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
                  (c)  In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the city manager, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.

                  (3)  Any other discharge violation that the city manager believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public; 
                  (4)  Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the superintendent's exercise of his emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
                  (5)  Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
                  (6)  Failure to provide, within 30 days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;

                  When the city manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city manager may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within ten days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the city manager. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city manager to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.

                  The city manager may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections 110-459 and 110-460 of this article and shall be judicially enforceable.

Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

                  When the city manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city manager may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. Furthermore, the city manager may continue to require such additional self-monitoring for at least 90 days after consistent compliance has been achieved, after which time the self-monitoring conditions in the discharge permit shall control.

                  (1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
                  (2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
                  (b)  Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

                  (a)  When the city manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city manager may fine such user in the amount of $1,000.00. Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation, per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other longterm average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
                  (b)  Assessments may be added to the user's next scheduled sewer service charge and the city manager shall have such other collection remedies as may be available for other service charges and fees. 
                  (c)  Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of 20 percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of seven percent per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties. 
                  (d)  Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the city manager to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within ten days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the city manager may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The city manager may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. 
                  (e)  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

                  (a)  The city manager may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The city manager may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
                  (b)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city manager may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The city manager may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city manager that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in section 110-464 of this article are initiated against the user. 
                  (c)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the city manager prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under section 110-458 or 110-464 of this article.

                  (2)  The notification provided in subsection (1) of this section shall inform the alleged violating user of a date and time for an administrative hearing, which hearing shall occur no earlier than 30 days after the violator's receipt of the notification. 
                  (3)  The city manager shall preside over the administrative hearing and shall entertain testimony and evidence. 
                  (4)  The alleged violating user shall have the opportunity to be represented by counsel and to examine and cross examine witnesses. 
                  (5)  If the alleged violating user is represented at the hearing by counsel, the city shall likewise be represented by the city attorney. 
                  (6)  The city manager shall issue written findings as soon after the hearing as is practical. 
                  (7)  The decision of the city manager, if adverse to the alleged violating user, may be appealed to the city councilmembers, for a final and binding decision. If an appeal is to be taken, written notice of the appeal shall be delivered to the city no later than ten days after the violator's receipt of the superintendent's written findings. Failure to appeal within ten days relinquishes all rights of appeal.

                  Sec. 110-551. - Upset. 
                  (a)  For the purposes of this section, the term "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the industrial user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation. 
                  (b)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (c) of this section are met. 
                  (c)  An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence, that: 
                  (1)  An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause of the upset. 
                  (2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures. 
                  (3)  The industrial user has submitted the following information to the POTW and treatment plant operator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five working days): 
                  a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance. 
                  b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue. 
                  c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
                  (d)  In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
                  (e)  Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
                  (f)  The industrial user shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.

                  Sec. 110-552. - General/specific prohibitions. 
                  An industrial user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in section 110-111 of this article if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
                  (1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the industrial user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
                  (2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.

                  Sec. 110-553. - Bypass. 
                  (a)  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of an industrial user's treatment facility. 
                  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
                  (b)  An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c), (d) and (e) of this section. 
                  (c)  If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW, at least ten days before the date of the bypass if possible. 
                  (d)  An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the POTW within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
                  (e)  Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless: 
                  (1)  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage; 
                  (2)  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment equipment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
                  (3)  The industrial user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) of this section. 
                  (f)  The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the POTW determines that if will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (e) of this section.

                  Sec. 110-554. - Slug load or slug. 
                  (a)  For the purpose of this section, the term "slug" means the intentional discharge at a flow rate of concentration which could cause a violation of the prohibited discharge standards in section 110-111 of this article. 
                  (b)  A user shall submit oral notice to the city manager of an unanticipated slug that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of any slug. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of any slug loadings which would create a fire or explosion hazard; corrosive structural damage to the sewer lines or the treatment plant; solid or viscous pollutant, including oxygen-demanding pollutants released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which will cause interference; heat which will inhibit biological activity; petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin in amounts that will cause interference or pass through; pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapor or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems. The written submission shall contain a description of the slug and its cause, the duration of the slug, including exact dates and times. The city manager may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
                  (c)  Slug loadings are prohibited, and the city manager may take an enforcement action against a user for a slug loading.

                  (1)  The basic unit Ct, which shall be revised biennially, shall be determined as follows: 
                  Ct = (Bd Bc + Sd Sc + Gd Gc + Vt) 
                  Where: 

                   
                  (2)  Bd, Sd and Gd shall be revised not less frequently than biannually and shall be determined by dividing actual wastewater treatment plant loading less total surcharged loading by total annual volume contribution by domestic wastewater dischargers. 
                  (3)  Bc, Sc and Gc shall be revised not less often than two years by dividing their respective annual maintenance and operation costs by their respective annual loadings. 
                  (4)  Wastewater monitoring and reporting shall be as described in division 6 of this article. 
                  (5)  Wastewater discharge volume (Vm) for dischargers of normal strength wastewater shall be 100 percent of the amount of water metered. For industrial wastewater dischargers which discharge surcharged waste the wastewater discharge volume (Vu) shall be 80 percent of the amount of water metered unless it can be shown that the volume of wastewater discharge is less.

After said reserve in said fund has been accumulated in its full amount required to be maintained therein as aforesaid, the money then to be paid monthly from the revenue fund into said sinking fund, except as hereinafter provided, shall be one-sixth of the interest payable on the certificates on the next ensuing interest payment date and 1/12 of the principal of the certificates payable on the next certificate maturity date coming due in the next succeeding sinking fund year. If in any month, for any reason, the full amount required hereunder shall not be paid into the sinking fund, any deficiency shall be added to the amount required to be paid into said sinking fund in the next succeeding month. After the reserve in said sinking fund shall have been accumulated in the full amount required to be maintained therein as aforesaid, it shall be maintained for the purpose of paying principal and interest falling due in any year as to which there would otherwise be a default, and if money is taken from the reserve in said fund for the payment of such principal or interest, the money so taken shall be replaced in said fund from the first monies in the revenue fund thereafter available and not required to be used for maintenance and operation charges. 
                  (3)  Reserve fund. After there has been paid from the revenue fund in each sinking fund year all amounts hereinabove required to be made, the remaining available monies in the revenue fund, except the working capital provided for above, shall be paid at the end of each month into a special fund to be known and hereby created as "Renewal and Extension Reserve Fund," sometimes hereinafter called the reserve fund, and the payments into said reserve fund shall continue and recontinue until such time as there shall be in said fund an amount equal to six percent of the aggregate principal amount of the certificates authorized to be issued under the bond issue ordinance. Thereafter, payments need be made into said reserve fund only for the purpose of reimbursing money withdrawn or expended therefrom in which event such monthly payments as above stipulated to be made shall immediately recommence until all monies withdrawn or expended therefrom have been repaid. Expenditures shall be made from the said reserve fund only for the purpose of: 
                  a.  In case of an emergency having a major effect upon the gas system caused by some extraordinary occurrence and which makes it necessary to use funds of the gas system for the alleviation or removal of such effects, and an insufficiency of money exists in the revenue fund to meet such emergency; 
                  b.  Making replacements, additions, extensions and improvements deemed by the governing body of the city reasonable and necessary and to the best interest of the city and the certificate holders; or 
                  c.  Paying principal of and interest on the certificates falling due at any time for the payment of which money is not available in the sinking fund. 
                  The mayor and council shall first obtain the consulting engineer's recommendation and approval with reference to expenditures to be made from said reserve fund, except in the case of payment therefrom for maturing principal and interest when other monies are not available for that purpose. 
                  (4)  Extra funds. Whenever and so long as the amount of the reserve in the sinking fund equals the amount required to be maintained therein as aforesaid and the amount in the reserve fund equals the amount required to be maintained in said fund as aforesaid, 50 percent of the remaining revenues in the revenue fund, after setting apart in said revenue fund the reserve for working capital as aforesaid and after the monthly payments into the sinking fund of one-sixth of the interest payable on the certificates on the next ensuing interest payment date and 1/12 of the principal of the certificates payable on the next certificate maturity date coming due in the next succeeding sinking fund year, and after setting apart in said revenue fund a further reserve in an amount which, when added to the gross revenues and income reasonably expected to be derived from the system during the then ensuing six-month period, shall be sufficient to make all payments into the sinking fund during said six-month period, shall be paid at the end of each month into the sinking fund and the money so paid in said sinking fund shall be used for sinking fund purposes in calling or acquiring certificates prior to maturity as provided in article II of the bond issue ordinance, and the balance of said remaining revenues may be disposed of by the council as the council may from time to time determine to be for the best interests of the city.

                  The sinking fund and the reserve fund herein provided for shall be kept in banks separate from that of the depository of the revenue fund, which banks shall be designated as the "Sinking Fund Custodian" and the "Reserve Fund Custodian," respectively. The city council hereby designates and appoints The Citizens and Southern National Bank of Atlanta, Georgia, as Sinking Fund Custodian, the Moultrie Banking Company as Reserve Fund Custodian, and the Moultrie National Bank as depository of the Revenue Fund.

                  Sec. 114-26. - Purpose and intent. 
                  Community trees provide many environmental, social, and economic benefits. In addition to the aesthetic value of trees, they protect the environment and improve health by reducing carbon dioxide and introducing oxygen into the air. Furthermore, trees reduce soil erosion due to storm water runoff, conserve energy by providing shade, and serve as protective buffers between varying zoning classifications, as well as provide benefits to property values, business revenues, scenic quality, urban design, human health and well-being, outdoor recreation, and wildlife. Therefore, the purpose of this ordinance is to sustain and enhance the functions and benefits of trees and the community forest for the citizens of Moultrie, Georgia and to utilize trees for all of their positive aspects. 
                  It is hereby declared that trees within the city are both an economic and aesthetic asset to the city. The fostering of positive public attitudes toward the value of trees and green space to the community warrants directed public education efforts. It is further declared that existing trees are in need of protection and qualified maintenance, and that measures should be undertaken to promote the planting of additional trees.

                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Boundary tree means any tree that has any part of its trunk located on two or more properties or property lines other than property of the City of Moultrie or rights-of-way. Ownership of, and responsibility for, a boundary tree shall be shared equally by the owners of all properties upon which any portion of its trunk grows. Trees with branches encroaching on a property with items other than a trunk, i.e.: limbs, leaves, fruit, etc. are not considered boundary trees. 
                  Buildable area means that portion of a site that development may or does occur. 
                  Caliper means the diameter or thickness of the main stem of a young tree or sapling as measured at six inches above ground level. This measurement is used for nursery-grown trees. 
                  City of Moultrie Tree means any tree whose trunk is growing wholly or partially on land owned by City of Moultrie, including, but not limited to, public street rights-of-way, parks, and building and facility yards.

                  Critical root zone means a more or less circular area above and extending 24 inches below the ground around the trunk of a tree with a radius equivalent to the distance to the drip line, or one and one-quarter feet for every one inch in diameter-at-breast height (DBH), whichever is greater. The critical root zone increases in size as a tree grows larger and serves as the tree protection zone. 
                  Diameter-at-breast height (DBH) means a standard measurement of tree size and is a tree trunk diameter measured in inches at a height of 54 inches above the ground. If a tree splits into multiple trunks below 54 inches, the trunk is measured at its most narrow point beneath the split. Measurements of one-half-inch or more are rounded to the higher DBH. 
                  Drip line means a line extending down to the ground from the greatest horizontal extent of a tree's branches, more or less forming a cylinder around the tree. 
                  Exceptional tree means any tree determined by the tree committee, as provided for herein, to be of notable historic interest, high aesthetic value or of unique character because of species, type, age, location, or size. 
                  Imminently dangerous tree means a tree that shows extensive signs of insects or disease, infections, wounds or other mechanical damage, decay, or structural defects; an unhealthy tree that may pose a threat to property and/or safety. 
                  Ownership of any tree shall be determined by the location of its trunk. If the entire trunk is located solely on one property, the property owner(s) shall be deemed the owner(s) of the tree.

                  (Ord. No. 2009-61, § 3, 7-7-2009) 
                  Sec. 114-29. - Cutting, trimming or removing trees; application required; actions by tree committee. 
                  (a)  Except as otherwise provided, no person shall cut, remove, trim or in any way damage any City of Moultrie Tree or shall create any condition injurious to any such tree without having first made a written application to the committee and having obtained advance written permission from the committee. The committee shall take action on the application within 45 days of its receipt. The form of application shall be established from time to time by the committee, and the committee may delegate to one or more of its members or officers the power to grant such permission in accordance with standards set by it. The committee may, in its discretion, hold public hearings on any application and may approve all or any part of an application upon such terms and conditions as the committee may fix. In considering any application before it, the committee shall base its decision on whether the public and private benefit that will result from granting the application outweighs the public and private benefit that will result from denying it. 
                  (b)  The city shall have the right to cause the removal of any dead or diseased trees on private property within the city, when such trees constitute a hazard to safety and property, or harbor insects or disease which constitutes a potential threat to other trees within the city. The tree committee shall notify in writing the owners of such trees. Removal shall be done by said owners at their own expense within 60 days after the date of service of notice. Owners will be afforded a hearing before the committee prior to removal, if the owners so desire. Failure to act within the 60-day period shall prompt further action by the committee in accordance with section 114-37. 
                  (c)  When any tree is encroaching on city property or rights-of-way and it is determined that more than fifty (50) percent of it's diameter-at-breast height (DBH), as determined by the City of Moultrie Engineering Department or a licensed engineer or surveyor, is located on property not owned by the city, the city shall have the right to cause the removal of said tree(s). The tree committee shall notify in writing the owner(s) of such tree(s) and removal shall be done by said owner(s) at their own expense within 60 days after the date of service of notice. Owners will be afforded a hearing before the committee prior to removal, if the owner(s) request same in writing within 15 days of notification. Failure to request a hearing within the time required or to act within the 60-day period shall subject the owner(s) to the penalties contained in subsection 114-37(c). 
                  (d)  Any tree determined to have more than fifty (50) percent of its diameter-at-breast height (DBH), as determined by the City of Moultrie Engineering Department or a licensed engineer or surveyor, located on property not owned by the city, shall be cut, trimmed or removed by said owner(s) at their own expense and any and all maintenance to said tree shall be the responsibility of its owner(s). 
                  (e)  Except as otherwise provided herein, no boundary tree shall be removed unless and until all owners have signed an agreement for the removal and sharing the cost. The owners may split the cost and pay for the removal or one owner may reimburse the other. Regardless, no removal or maintenance of the tree is deemed the responsibility of one party over the other. If a boundary tree becomes diseased or dies, any owner thereof may have the tree removed over objection from the remaining owner(s). In the case of a diseased or dead boundary tree the owner who opts for the removal is the responsible party for payment, but may submit a bill to the other property owner(s) or seek reimbursement for their pro rata share as determined by the number of property owners of the boundary tree. 
                  (f)  Subsection 114-29(a) shall not apply to local power, cable and telephone companies, and their agents, or when other emergency situations with respect to the maintenance of utility rights-of-way exist. However, these agencies should follow procedures and tree maintenance techniques in accordance with the American National Standard for Tree Care Operations A300 dated June 1, 1995. A copy of which is available at the planning and community development department. 
                  (Ord. No. 2009-61, § 4, 7-7-2009; Ord. No. 2011-106, §§ 3—6, 10-18-2011) 
                  Sec. 114-30. - City departments granted emergency powers. 
                  Departments of the city are granted emergency powers with respect to cutting, trimming, or removing trees in order to restore the delivery of city services following service interruptions.

                  Sec. 114-31. - Procedure for land clearing or land disturbance permits. 
                  (a)  Before any land clearing or land disturbing activities can begin on any parcel of land (excluding one- and two-family dwellings), the land owner or an authorized agent must make application for an erosion and sediment control plan review, along with the notice of intent as required by the State of Georgia Environmental Protection Division. A copy of the application and the state-required fee for local governments should be turned into the planning and community development department. 
                  (b)  An additional local application should accompany plans that must adhere to the specifications of the City of Moultrie Zoning Ordinance. This plan must be approved before land clearing procedures or land disturbing activities commence. This plan can be part of the building construction plans.

                  Sec. 114-32. - Tree replacement and removal for new developments and redevelopments greater than 50 percent. 
                  (a)  All new development and redevelopment of property shall have a number of trees equivalent to 15 tree units per acre of development site. (Not including land area covered by buildings.) All properties less than one acre shall have a minimum number of trees equivalent to seven units. Where trees must be added to achieve the required 15 tree units per acre of development site one species may not comprise more than 25 percent of the required units. Where existing pines already comprise 50 percent or more of the required units any additional pines planted will not be credited toward the required tree units per acre. 
                  Example: A 19-inch DBH tree has a tree density equaled to two units. Four two-inch caliper replacement trees at .5 per tree would also equal two tree density units. Therefore, a tree that has a DBH of 19 inches would be replaced with four replacement trees that have a two-inch caliper. 
                  (b)  The committee shall direct replacement with suitable trees in suitable locations on property of the city in those situations where trees have been removed. City of Moultrie Suggested List of Shade Quality Trees is a list of trees approved and adopted by the Moultrie Tree Committee that includes tree species approved for planting(s) throughout the City of Moultrie to satisfy the requirements of this chapter. Said list shall be on file in the planning and community development department. 
                  (c)  Prior to any new development and redevelopment of property an application must be filed with and approved by the committee or their designee in writing. 
                  (d)  The provisions of this section shall not apply to one- and two-family dwellings.

                  (a)  A tree may be declared an exceptional tree if it is in fair or better condition and capable of delivering at least 75 percent of foliage to the scaffolding branches that equals or exceeds the following diameter sizes: Large trees 40 feet or more in height at maturity, e.g. oaks, hickories, yellow poplars, sweetgums, long leaf pine, sycamore, etc. with a 20 DBH. 
                  (b)  Tree stands may be declared exceptional tree stands if they consist of a contiguous grouping of trees which are in fair or better condition and that is capable of delivering at least 75 percent of foliage to the scaffolding branches based on the following criteria: 
                  (1)  A stand with purity of species composition or of a rare or unusual nature; 
                  (2)  A stand of historical significance; or, 
                  (3)  A stand with exceptional aesthetic quality. 
                  (c)  Before any exceptional tree or exceptional tree stand may be removed, an application must be filed with and approved in writing by the committee or their designee. 
                  (d)  A less size tree can be considered exceptional if it is of a rare or unusual species or of exceptional quality or of historical significance. 
                  (e)  The provisions of this section shall not apply to one- and two-family dwellings.

                  (b)  Tree protection devices are necessary to eliminate activities detrimental to trees including but not limited to: 
                  (1)  Soil compaction in the critical root zone resulting from heavy equipment, vehicular or excessive pedestrian traffic or storage of equipment or building materials; 
                  (2)  Root disturbance due to cuts, fills, or trenching; 
                  (3)  Wounds to exposed roots, trunks or limbs by mechanical equipment; and, 
                  (4)  Other activities such as chemical storage, cement truck cleaning, fire, etc. 
                  (c)  All required trees shall be maintained in good condition at all times. When necessary, dead trees shall be replaced in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and within a time period appropriate to the growing season of the species in question. Replacement trees must last at least two years.

                  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, where practical difficulties, unnecessary hardships, and results inconsistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter may result from the strict application of certain provisions thereof, variances may be granted by the Moultrie Tree Committee. In considering a variance the Moultrie Tree Committee may impose conditions to protect the best interests of the surrounding property and property owners, the neighborhood, or the community as a whole and consistent with the purpose and intent of this article. 
                  (1)  Application. All requests for variances shall be heard by the Moultrie Tree Committee upon written application. Such application shall be accompanied by:

                  b.  A statement and evidence demonstrating that the following criteria are met: 
                  1.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, character, topography; 
                  2.  The application of the provisions from this article to the particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship; 
                  3.  The benefits of granting the variance will be greater than any negative impacts on adjacent uses and will further the purpose and intent of this chapter; 
                  4.  The special conditions and circumstances on the site do not result from the actions of the applicant; and, 
                  5.  The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the land, building or structures; and, 
                  c.  A proposed mitigation plan that offsets the effects of the proposed variance during site preparation, construction and post-construction phases. Specific plans using mitigation measures such as the tree bank should be noted during the variance proceedings. 
                  (2)  The committee may grant waivers from any or all of the above provisions or may establish guidelines for the granting of waivers by its designee. Waivers shall not be granted except in cases of extreme hardship (excluding financial hardships).
