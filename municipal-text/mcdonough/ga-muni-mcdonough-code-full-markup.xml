            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of McDonough, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the city council and noted in the history notes after the various sections as the Prior Code. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance included herein. 
                  Notes which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a title of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the title. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Beth Singletary, Code Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

                  The publisher is most grateful to Evelyn M. Craig, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.

                  Sec. 6.16. - Construction; other taxes. 
                  This city shall be empowered to levy any other tax allowed now or hereafter by state law, including but not limited to the insurance premium tax at the maximum rate allowable by law, and the specific mention of any right, power, or authority in this article shall not be construed as limiting in any way the general powers of this city to govern its local affairs. 
                  Sec. 6.17. - Collection of delinquent taxes and fees.

Such transfer or assignment, when made, shall vest the purchaser or transferee with all right, title and interest as provided by Georgia law governing sales and transfers of tax fi. fas.; provided, however, that upon levy of execution and sale of property pursuant to such tax fi. fa., whether assigned, transferred or executed by the city, the owner of such property in fee simple or lesser interest shall not lose his right to redeem the property in accordance with the requirements of redemption of property sold under state or county ad valorem tax fi. fas., as said requirements now exist or as may be hereinafter provided by law.

                  Sections: 

                  2.03.010 - Purpose. 
                  It is the policy of the City to purchase and maintain insurance policies and/or coverages that protect the City, its assets and Employees, as that term is defined herein, from common perils and claims. 
                  Any Employee who becomes aware of a claim or potential claim against the City or against them arising out of the scope of their performance of duties on behalf of the City shall immediately relay such notice to the City Administrator or his designee, who shall thereafter convey such claim to the appropriate insurer for adjustment and defense. 
                  In any circumstance in which it appears that no insuring contract is available for the adjustment or defense of a claim against an Employee, the City adopts the following policy as set forth in this Chapter. 
                  (Ord. No. 10-07-19(B), § 1, 7-19-2010)

                  2.03.030 - Defense of Employees. 
                  Whenever, for any matter not otherwise covered by the City's insurance coverage, any claim is made or proceeding is brought against an Employee, asserting against the Employee personal liability for damages or expenses arising out of the performance of his duties or in any way connected therewith, whether based on negligence, violation of contract rights, or violation of civil, constitutional, common law, or other statutory rights, whether federal, state, or local, the City shall, upon such Employee's timely written request, and as a part of such Employee's compensation and terms of employment, provide for his or her defense, unless otherwise limited by the terms of this Chapter. The City may expend funds for such purposes, including but not limited to court costs, deposition costs, witness fees and compensation, and all other like costs, expenses and fees.

                  2.03.040 - Grounds for refusal of defense. 
                  (1)	The City may refuse to provide for, or if a defense has begun, may withdraw from, the defense of a claim or proceeding brought against an Employee if it determines that: 
                  a.	The act or omission did not arise out of and in the course of the employment of such Employee nor was the act or omission reasonably related to such employment; 
                  b.	The Employee acted or failed to act because of intentional misconduct, actual fraud, corruption, or actual malice on his or her part; 
                  c.	Provision of a defense against the claim or proceeding would not be in the best interests of the City; 
                  d.	The proceeding is a criminal prosecution; provided, however, that a defense may be provided where (1) the criminal prosecution is one for an alleged violation of the Georgia Open Records Act or Georgia Open Meetings Act, and it is determined that the charged Employee has acted in good faith to comply with the subject Act and has substantially complied with all City policies relating to the subject Act, which determination shall be made by the Council or (2) the Employee is following direct instructions from a supervisor within his or her chain of command and there is no allegation of actual fraud, corruption, or actual malice on his or her part; 
                  e.	The request was not timely made; 
                  f.	The claim arises out of an act or omission committed or occurring at a time when the Employee was under the influence of drugs or intoxicants; 
                  g.	The act or omission giving rise to the claim was in direct disobedience of an order or instructions of a superior or in contravention of established City policy; 
                  h.	The Employee fails to cooperate in the defense of a claim or proceeding; or 
                  i.	The defense of any such civil action by the City would create a conflict of interest between the City and the Employee. 
                  (2)	The determinations required by this Chapter shall be made by the Council. The Council may refuse, at any time, prior to or after the approval or assumption of the defense, to provide for the defense of any Employee if it is determined or discovered that any of the grounds for refusal set forth in this Chapter exist. 
                  (3)	Upon approval of the defense of a claim or proceeding against an Employee, the Council shall refer the matter to the City's attorney for disposition. In the event two or more Employees or groups of Employees are involved, and the interest of one Employee or group of Employees conflicts with the interests of another Employee or group of Employees, the Council shall specify which Employee or group of Employees shall be represented by the City's attorney and shall, for the other Employees or groups of Employees choose and employ appropriate counsel at the expense of the City.

                  2.03.050 - Payment of judgments; compromise and settlement of claims. 
                  (1)	Where the City has undertaken to defend Claims or Proceedings brought against an Employee as provided by this Chapter, the City may, in its sole discretion, by resolution duly adopted and approved, pay all or any part of final judgments awarded against the Employee by a court of competent jurisdiction or any amount payable as a monetary settlement of any such civil action, subject to the limitations and exclusions which follow. 
                  (2)	Notwithstanding the foregoing, payment of settlements, compromises, judgments and claims shall be limited as follows for any claim or proceeding: 
                  a.	No Sum shall be paid on behalf of any Employee who admits, in any sworn statement, or for whom it has been so determined in any administrative, judicial or other legal proceedings, to have knowingly and intentionally violated state or federal law and/or the City's policies and procedures. 
                  b.	Whenever there is a final determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that the Employee, with respect to the act or failure to act giving rise to the subject Claim or Proceeding, acted or failed to act because of actual fraud, corruption, or actual malice, the Employee shall be required to reimburse the City any amounts paid in defense of the Claim or Proceeding, and any amounts paid as a judgment, compromise, or settlement of such Claim or Proceeding. 
                  c.	No Sum shall be paid pursuant to this Chapter unless the claimant unconditionally releases each and every Employee and the City from any and all suits, claims, actions, causes of action, demands, damages, costs, expenses and compensation on account of or in any way arising out of or related to any such single or continuing incident or occurrence. 
                  d.	No Sum shall be paid pursuant to this Chapter where punitive or exemplary damages have been assessed against any Employee by any court of competent jurisdiction. 
                  e.	Any such disbursement as provided in this Chapter shall be deemed to be for public purposes and may be paid from City funds.

Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed in any way to reduce or eliminate the rights of any Employee against any other party.

No person not an Employee of the City and otherwise entitled to the benefits created hereunder shall have any right to enforce the provisions of this Chapter against the City.

                  2.20.010 - Purpose. 
                  Declaration of policy. It is the policy of the City of McDonough (the "City") that the proper operation of democratic government requires that public officials be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that governmental decisions and policy be made in proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of these goals, a Code of Ethics for all City Officials is adopted. 
                  A.	This Chapter has the following purposes: 
                  1.	To encourage high ethical standards in the official conduct of City Officials; 
                  2.	To establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for City Officials by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interest of the City; 
                  3.	To require City Officials to disclose private financial or other interests in matters affecting the City; and 
                  4.	To serve as a basis for disciplining those who refuse to abide by its terms. 
                  B.	In the performance of their duties, City Officials must avoid even the appearance of impropriety, and are prohibited from: 
                  1.	Using public office for private gain; 
                  2.	Impeding governmental efficiency or economy; or 
                  3.	Affecting adversely the confidence of the public in the integrity of the government.

                  2.20.030 - Definitions. 
                  The words and phrases, below, shall have the following meanings, except when context clearly indicates a different definition: 
                  City means the City of McDonough, Georgia. 
                  City Official or Official, unless otherwise expressly defined, does not include City employees, but does mean the Mayor, members of the City Council, City of McDonough Municipal Court judges (including substitute judges), the City Administrator, the City Clerk, the City Attorney. The term "City Official" also includes all individuals, including any City employees, appointed by the Mayor and/or City Council to City authorities, commissions, committees, boards, task forces, or other bodies which can, or may vote; or take formal action; or make official recommendations to the Mayor and City Council. "City Official" does not include members of the McDonough Youth Advisory Council. 
                  Employee means any person who is a full-time or part-time employee of the City. 
                  Family member means the spouse, mother, father, brother, sister, son or daughter of a City Official, or the mother-in-law, father-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, son-in-law or daughter-in-law of a City Official.

                  Remote interest means an interest of a person or entity, including a City Official, which would be affected in the same way as the general public. For example, the interest of a City Official in the property tax rate, general City fees, City water/sewer charges, or a comprehensive zoning ordinance, or similar matters, is deemed remote to the extent the City Official would be affected in the same manner as a member of the public at large. 
                  Substantial interest means an interest, either directly or through a member of the immediate family, in another person or entity, where: 
                  (1)	The interest is 5% or more of the voting stock, shares or equity of the entity, or ownership of $5,000 or more of the equity or market value of the entity; or 
                  (2)	The funds received by the person from another person or entity during the previous 12 months, either equal to or exceed: 
                  (a)	$5,000 in salary, bonuses, commissions or professional fees, or $5,000 in payment for goods, products or services, or 
                  (b)	10% of the recipient's gross income during that period, whichever is less; or 
                  (3)	The person serves as a corporate officer, or member of the board of directors, or other governing board, of a for-profit entity, other than a corporate entity owned or created by the City Council; or

                  Substantial interest in real property means an interest in real property, which is an equitable or legal ownership, with a market value of $5,000 or more.

                  2.20.040 - Prohibitions. 
                  All City Officials shall meet the following standards: 
                  A.	Compliance with the law. City Officials shall comply with all laws of the United States, the State of Georgia, and the City of McDonough in the performance of their public duties. These laws include, but are not limited to: the Constitution of the United States and the Georgia Constitution; laws pertaining to conflicts of interest, elections, campaigns, financial disclosures, employer responsibilities, and open processes of government; and City ordinances and written policies. 
                  B.	Policy role of elected officials. All City Officials shall respect and adhere to the City's structure of government, as outlined in the Charter, as well as its policies and procedures. The Mayor and Council determine the legislative policies of the City, with advice, information and analysis provided by citizens and other members of the public; members of City boards, committees, commissions; and City staff. No individual elected official may independently direct the activities of staff, interfere with the day-to-day administrative functions of the City, or the professional duties of the staff; nor impair the ability of City staff to implement the policy decisions of the governing body. 
                  C.	Independence of boards, committees and commissions. The independent advice of members of boards, committees and commissions is valuable to the public decision-making process. Therefore, Officials shall refrain from using their position to influence unduly the deliberations or outcomes of board, committee and commission proceedings of which they are not members. City Officials shall also refrain from appearing or speaking on behalf of themselves or third parties in front of any City board, committee or commission; however, this prohibition shall not prevent (1) an Official from appearing or speaking on behalf of the City in front of an independent authority or commission of the City; or (2) Officials from speaking on behalf of the City board, committee, or commission on which they serve, when such city board, committee, commission or council has expressly authorized and appointed such Official to speak on its behalf.

                  1.	City Officials shall not solicit or accept directly or indirectly anything of value from any person, corporation, or group which:

                  b.	Seeks to have an Official exercise a matter of discretion in his or her favor, in exchange for a thing of value; or 
                  c.	In exchange for the thing of value, seeks to have interests that may be affected by the performance or nonperformance of the official duty of the Official. 
                  2.	City Officials shall not directly or indirectly request, exact, receive, or agree to receive a gift, loan, favor, promise, benefit or thing of value for him/herself or another person if: 
                  a.	It could reasonably be considered to influence the Official in the future, and he/she is involved in any official act or action which results in a pecuniary benefit for the donor or lender which is not available to the public at large; or 
                  b.	It could reasonably be considered to influence, benefit or reward the Official, and he/she recently has been, or is now or within six months in the future, involved in any official act or action which results in a pecuniary benefit for the donor or lender which is not available to the public at large. 
                  3.	The above prohibitions shall not apply in the case of: 
                  a.	An occasional non-pecuniary gift of insignificant trinkets or gifts, such as a calendar, memento or pen received in the normal course of business with a value of less than $100.00; 
                  b.	Admission to, and or consumption of, food and beverages at a breakfast, lunch, dinner, function or event; 
                  c.	Awards publicly presented in recognition of public service; 
                  d.	Transactions authorized by, and performed in accordance with, O.C.G.A. § 16-10-6, as now, or as may be amended; 
                  e.	A commercially reasonable loan or other financial transaction, made in the ordinary course of business by an institution or individual authorized by the laws of Georgia to engage in the making of such loan or financial transaction; or 
                  f.	Campaign contributions made and reported in accordance with Georgia laws.

                  2.	Any City Official who serves as a corporate officer, or member of the board of directors, of a nonprofit entity, must disclose their interest on the record, prior to participating in a vote or decision regarding that entity. 
                  3.	Where the interest of a City Official in the subject matter of a vote or decision is remote or incidental, the Official may participate in the vote or decision and need not disclose the interest. 
                  F.	Use of public property. An Official shall not use City property of any kind for other than officially approved activities, nor shall he or she direct staff to use such property for these purposes. 
                  G.	Coercion by Officials. An Official shall not use his or her position in any way to coerce, or give the appearance of coercing, another person to provide any financial benefit to him or her or a family member, or those with whom a member has a financial interest. 
                  H.	Voting in matters of personal interest. City Officials shall not vote on any matter or transaction before the City Council that would directly and immediately affect his or her pecuniary interest. Provided, however, that in the event the matter or transaction is of general application, or in the event such vote would be proper under the City Charter, then the Official shall disclose his or her interest; and, following disclosure, shall be allowed to vote on the matter. Votes taken in compliance with the requirements of this section shall not constitute a violation of the Code of Ethics, and any ethics complaint filed on the basis of such, shall be subject to dismissal. 
                  I.	Unauthorized use of City staff. City Officials shall not use his or her superior position to unduly pressure, request, or otherwise require a member of City staff to:

                  2.	Purchase goods and services to be used for the Official's personal, business or political purposes; and/or 
                  3.	Work on personal business for the Official, without offering him or her just compensation. 
                  J.	Restrictions on contracts with former Officials. The City shall not enter into any contract with any person or business represented by such person, who has been within the proceeding 12-month period a City Official, unless the contract is awarded by a competitive bid or a committee selection process. 
                  K.	Improper use of official, non-public information. City Officials shall not directly or indirectly make use of, or permit others to make use of, official (confidential) information, which at the time of its disclosure is not subject to being made available to the general public, for the purpose of furthering a private interest regardless of whether the private interest belongs to the Official, or a third party. 
                  L.	Unauthorized attempts to bind the City. City Officials shall not order any goods and services for the City without prior official authorization for such an expenditure; nor shall Officials attempt to obligate the City, or give the impression of obligating the City without proper prior authorization to purchase or otherwise be liable for any goods, services or property.

All other proceedings in relation thereto shall be had as is provided by the laws of Georgia, and the defendant in said execution shall have rights of defense, by affidavit of illegality and otherwise, which are provided by the applicable laws in regard to tax executions. When a nulla bona entry has been entered by proper authority upon an execution issued by the Occupation Tax Clerk against any person defaulting on the occupation tax, the person against whom the entry was made shall not be allowed or entitled to have or collect any fees or charges whatsoever for services rendered after the entry of the nulla bona. Practitioners of professions and occupations shall be allowed to continue to practice their professions without the collection of any fees and charges due. If at any time after the entry of nulla bona has been made, the person against whom the execution issues pays the tax in full together with all interest and costs accrued on the tax, the person may collect any fees and charges due him or her as though he or she had never defaulted in the payment of the taxes.

                  A.	All occupation taxes levied under this Chapter are levied on the amount of business to be transacted during the current calendar year. However, for convenience of both the City and the taxpayer, each person subject to the occupation tax levied in this Chapter shall, on or before the dates hereinafter set forth, file with the Occupation Tax Clerk, the return hereinafter specifically provided for, showing the gross receipts of that business during the preceding calendar year. This return shall be used as the basis for making estimated payment of the occupation tax for the current calendar year. The actual and final amount of tax levied for business transacted in the current calendar year shall be paid in accordance with a final return to be made after the end of the year, in accordance with the procedure set forth herein. 
                  B.	Where a person subject to the occupation tax for the calendar year has conducted business for only a part of the preceding year, the amount of gross receipts for such part shall be reported in said return. Said return shall also show a figure putting the receipts for such part of a year on an annual basis with the part-year receipts bearing the same ratio to the whole-year gross receipts as the part year bears to the whole year. Said figure shall be used as the estimate of the gross receipts of the business for the current calendar year in establishing the business tax liability. 
                  C.	The owner, proprietor, manager, or secretary officer of the business subject to said occupation tax of the current calendar year shall, at the end of the preceding year, or before January 15th, of the current calendar year, file with the Occupation Tax Clerk, on a form furnished by said officer, a signed return setting forth the amount of actual gross receipts of such business for the entire preceding calendar year. This return will be used to determine the final tax for the calendar year just completed and as an estimate of the gross receipts and occupation tax for the current year. 
                  D.	If the amount of the occupation tax for the preceding year based on the return provided for in this section and on the rate of said tax provided for in this Chapter, is less than the amount of occupation tax theretofore paid by said person based on the estimate filed pursuant to subsection (A) hereof, the difference in said amount shall be due and payable by the taxpayer to the City on April 15th, of the current year and delinquent if not paid on or before said date. 
                  E.	If the amount of the occupation tax for the preceding year based on the return provided for in this section and on the rate of said tax provided for in this Chapter, exceeds the amount of occupation tax theretofore paid by said person based on the estimate filed pursuant to subsection (A) hereof, the difference in said amount shall be refundable by the City to the taxpayer; or, if said business continues to conduct business in the City during the current year, such difference in amount may be credited by the City on the amount of occupation tax to be paid to the City by said person for the current year.

                  A.	Except in the case of judicial proceedings or other proceedings necessary to collect the occupation tax hereby levied, it shall be unlawful for any officer, employee or agent of the City, or any other person to divulge or make known in any manner the amount of gross receipts or any particulars set forth or disclosed in any occupation tax return required under this Chapter. All contents of said return shall be confidential and open only to the officials, and those tasked with the collection of the tax. Independent auditors or bookkeepers employed by the City shall be classed as "employees." Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the publication by City officials of statistics, so classified as to prevent the identification of particular reports or returns and items thereof; or the inspection of the records by duly qualified employees of the tax departments of the State of Georgia, the United States, and other local governments. Violation of this section shall be unlawful and upon conviction shall be punished as a misdemeanor. 
                  B.	Inspections of Books and Records. In any case the Occupation Tax Clerk of the City, through his/her officers, agents, employees, or representatives, may inspect the books of the business or profession for which the returns are made. The Occupation Tax Clerk shall have the right to inspect the books or records for the business or profession of which the return was made in the City, and upon demand of the Occupation Tax Clerk, such books or records shall be submitted for inspection by a representative of the City within 30 days. Failure to submit such books or records within 30 days shall be grounds for revocation of the tax certificate. In the case of practitioners of professions and occupations, the City shall be sensitive to the issues of client or customer confidentiality. In such cases, the practitioner may redact information claimed to be privileged before disclosing books or records of financial transactions. If such practitioner alleges that redaction provides inadequate protection to the confidences of its clients or customers, such practitioner may petition the Superior Court of Henry County for an in camera inspection, prior to examination by the Tax Clerk. Except for practitioners of professions and occupations electing to pay a flat fee in lieu of a gross receipts tax, adequate records shall be kept in the City, for examination by the Occupation Tax Clerk at that officer's discretion. If after examination of the books or records, it is determined that a deficiency occurs as a result of under reporting, interest in the amount of 1½ percent per month in addition to a ten percent penalty shall be assessed on all delinquent amounts for the period of any delinquency.

However, if the estimated tax liability for any monthly period shall exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) for a lodging provider who in the prior fiscal year remitted tax greater than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) in any three (3) consecutive months, such lodging provider shall file an estimated return and remit not less than fifty percent (50%) of the estimated tax liability for the monthly period by the twentieth (20th) day of the same monthly period. The amount of tax so remitted shall be credited against the amount to be due with the regular return for the monthly period to be filed on the twentieth (20th) day of the succeeding month. 
                  G.	Extension of time of filing; authority; requirements; remittance; penalty and interest. The governing authority of the City may, for good cause, extend the time for making returns for not longer than thirty (30) days. No extension shall be valid unless granted in writing upon written application of the lodging provider. Such grant may not be applicable for a period longer than twelve (12) consecutive months. A lodging provider granted an extension shall remit tax equaling not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the tax paid for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year; such remittance to be made on or before the date the tax would otherwise come due without the grant of extension. No penalty or interest shall be charged during the first ten (10) days of the extension period. Thereafter, interest shall be collected on the unpaid balance at the rate of one percent (1%) per month. 
                  H.	Collection fee allowed lodging providers. Lodging providers collecting the tax shall be allowed a percentage of the tax due and accounted for and shall be reimbursed in the form of a deduction in submitting, reporting and paying the amount due, if the amount is not delinquent at the time of payment. The rate of the deduction shall be three percent (3%) of the amount due, but only if the amount due was not delinquent at the time of payment.

                  Footnotes: 
                  --- (3) --- 
                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 10-06-07(B), § I, adopted June 7, 2010, amended Title 5, Ch. 5.08, in its entirety. Prior to this amendment, Ch. 5.08 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Prior Code. 

                  Sections: 
                  5.08.010 - Purpose. 
                  Based on City officials' own observations of facilities that exploit human sexuality for commercial profit, euphemistically referred to as "adult entertainment" (hereinafter "Adult Entertainment"), and the experiences of other urban cities and counties including, but not limited to, College Park, Georgia; McDonough, Georgia; Atlanta, Georgia; Columbus, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Pinellas County, Florida; Indianapolis, Indiana; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and Phoenix, Arizona, which experiences are relevant to the problems faced by the City of McDonough, Georgia, and based on the evidence and testimony of persons who have appeared before the Mayor and Council, the Mayor and Council take note of the well-known and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within the country. 
                  Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult entertainment on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the mayor and city council for the City of McDonough, Georgia (hereinafter the "governing body"), and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), and Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), and on studies in other communities including, but not limited to, Gwinnett County, Georgia; Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont, Texas, the governing body finds: 
                  1.	Sexually oriented businesses, also known as adult entertainment establishments, lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled or inadequately controlled by the operators of the establishments. The commercial exploitation of human sexuality, in all forms in which such exploitation may be manifested has a deleterious effect on the community where it takes place as heretofore mentioned. Sexually oriented businesses tend to cause an increase in criminal behavior in nearby areas, including but not limited to disorderly conduct, prostitution, solicitation, drug trafficking, drug use and corruption of public officials. 
                  2.	We take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country and we base our observation both upon the experience of other urban and sub-urbancounties and municipalities, which we find relevant to the problems faced by the City. 
                  3.	Certain employees of adult entertainment establishments as defined herein tend to engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments. 
                  4.	Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live nude entertainment. Offering or providing such private or semi-private space encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. 
                  5.	Adult entertainment establishments tend to escalate and exacerbate undesirable community conditions, including but not limited to blight, diminished property values, increased need for law enforcement and emergency medical response resources, and increased burden on the judicial system as a result of the criminal behavior which the governing body finds such business establishments bring to a community. The secondary negative effects that are caused by such businesses are not limited to such facilities that offer live or recorded performances with human nudity or the depiction of sexual acts but other forms of sexually oriented businesses that also have a deleterious effect on nearby neighborhoods, commercial districts and on urban life in general. These other types of such businesses include but are not limited to adult bookstores, peep shows, massage parlors, bath houses, adult gift and novelty shops and lingerie or nude modeling studios. 
                  6.	Persons frequent certain adult theatres, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses. 
                  7.	Communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses. 
                  8.	AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components. 
                  9.	According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. 
                  10.	Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. 
                  11.	Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in some areas of some sexually oriented businesses. 
                  12.	Allowing the clustering of Adult Entertainment Businesses, or allowing such businesses to have direct exposure to principle thoroughfares has a tendency to depress the surrounding business atmosphere of non-adult oriented businesses. 
                  13.	Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
                  14.	Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult entertainment establishments as defined herein. 
                  15.	Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments. 
                  16.	The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and other secondary negative effects as described herein. 
                  17.	It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding employees who may engage in the conduct which this Chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity. 
                  18.	The fact that an applicant for an adult entertainment license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this Chapter. 
                  19.	The barring of such individuals from the management of adult entertainment establishments for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. 
                  20.	Interstate exposure of Adult Entertainment Businesses can have a tendency to depress the surrounding business atmosphere of non-adult oriented businesses. 
                  21.	Location of Adult Entertainment Businesses in the near vicinity of hotels and motels can have a tendency to depress the surrounding business atmosphere and contribute to crimes related to adult oriented businesses, including prostitution, pandering, solicitation and drug use. 
                  22.	Public nudity, particularly when related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages, tends to beget criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions such as depressed property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for the allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and an acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. The limitation of nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with sexually explicit establishments. 
                  23.	The findings noted in paragraphs number (1) through (22) raise substantial governmental concerns. 
                  24.	The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of the City will be promoted by the enactment of this Chapter. 
                  Moreover, it is the finding of the Mayor and Council that the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, in all the forms in which such exploitation may be manifested, collectively referred to hereafter as "Adult Entertainment," has a deleterious effect on the community where it takes place and that such effects are intensified and exacerbated when Adult Entertainment is provided in conjunction with the service or consumption of alcohol. The Mayor and Council find that Adult Entertainment causes an increase in criminal behavior in nearby areas, including, but not limited to, disorderly conduct, prostitution, solicitation, drug trafficking, drug use and corruption of public officials. The Mayor and Council further find that Adult Entertainment facilities escalate undesirable community conditions, including blight, diminish property values, increase the need for law enforcement and emergency medical response resources, and increase the burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described. 
                  The Mayor and Council expressly find that the negative effects of Adult Entertainment are not limited to Adult Entertainment that offers live or recorded performances with human nudity or the depiction of sexual acts. Other forms of Adult Entertainment also have a deleterious effect upon the quality of life in nearby neighborhoods and commercial districts and on urban life in general. Such other forms of Adult Entertainment include, but are not limited to, adult bookstores, peep shows, adult theaters, massage parlors, bath houses, adult gift or novelty shops, and lingerie modeling studios. 
                  Further, based on the investigation conducted by the City of McDonough regarding lingerie modeling studios, it is the finding of the Mayor and Council that lingerie modeling studios are facilities that offer Adult Entertainment in the form of live human nudity in a private setting. Based on the evidence presented to the Mayor and Council, it is apparent that lingerie modeling studios, by providing Adult Entertainment in a private setting, lead to criminal behavior including, but not limited to, masturbation for hire, prostitution, and sodomy. 
                  Furthermore, based on the investigation conducted by the City, it is apparent that lingerie modeling studios pose a more difficult challenge to the enforcement of regulations pertaining to Adult Entertainment Business, in that the activity occurs within a private setting, as opposed to in an open area which is visible to all Patrons of the facility. For the same reason, the Mayor and Council have identified massage parlors as presenting similar risks of criminal behavior and problems of enforcement. The Mayor and Council have determined that lighting, visibility and access are measures that can reduce the risk of crime to Patrons and others. 
                  Accordingly, the Mayor and Council find that it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community to limit and regulate Adult Entertainment within the corporate boundaries of the City, so as to limit the adverse impact on property values, other business uses, residential uses and public and semi-public uses; to ensure that Adult Entertainment uses and Adult Entertainment facilities do not impede development, redevelopment and neighborhood revitalization efforts; to restrict Adult Entertainment and adult uses in heavily-used public pedestrian areas and to protect Patrons of Adult Entertainment Business from unreasonable risk of crime. 
                  This Chapter is not intended as a de facto prohibition of legally-protected forms of expression. This Chapter is intended to represent a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of neighborhoods and development through the regulation of Adult Entertainment facilities versus any legally protected rights of providers and Patrons of Adult Entertainment. 
                  It is a matter of governmental interest and concern and in the interest of the public welfare to minimize the proliferation of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with facilities that commercially exploit human sexuality through Adult Entertainment to limit Adult Entertainment uses of property to certain prescribed areas of the City. To that end, this Chapter is adopted as set forth herein.

                  5.08.080 - License Required. 
                  A.	No person, group, unincorporated association, firm, partnership, corporation or other entity may operate or conduct an Adult Entertainment Business or offer any form of Adult Entertainment without a valid and current License having first been issued by the City Administrator, except as provided in below when the City Administrator or his designee fails to approve or deny an application for an adult entertainment license within the thirty-day period provided for therein.

In no event shall any license issued to an adult entertainment establishment under this Chapter be in force or effect after midnight of December 31 of the year in which it is issued.

                  C.	Licenses and permits issued under this Chapter shall not be transferable, except for a license or ownership interest under the following circumstances: in case of the death of an owner or a licensee as defined herein, the license pertaining to the owner's or licensee's adult entertainment establishment shall remain in force and effect for a period of up to thirty (30) days in order to allow the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) who will inherit the ownership interest or license an opportunity to apply for and qualify to hold the interest or license under this Chapter. In order to qualify to hold said interest or license, the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) shall make application to the City within the thirty-day period as if he or she were applying for a new ownership interest or license under this Chapter. If a completed application is filed within the thirty-day period, then the existing license shall remain in effect for an additional period of up to thirty (30) days following the date of filing in order to allow the City Administrator to grant or deny the application under this Chapter. If the City Administrator grants the application, or if the application is deemed granted because of a failure to approve or deny the same within the thirty-day period provided for in this Chapter, then the beneficiary applicant(s) shall become the new owner(s) of the interest or license, which shall be considered transferred without any interruption of ownership interest and without any loss of vested rights, if any, which may have existed from the original approval of same, said interest or license being thereafter subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Chapter. If the beneficiary fails to file a completed application under this subsection within the thirty-day period, or if the application is denied (and if appealed, the denial is upheld on appeal), then the ownership interest or license shall terminate at midnight on the thirtieth day or at midnight on the day that a final judgment upholding the appeal is entered, and the adult entertainment establishment shall close its business on that day; provided, however, that nothing herein shall be construed to allow or permit any license to remain in force and effect beyond midnight on December 31 of the year in which the death occurs, unless necessary to allow for one (1) or both of the two (2) thirty-day periods provided for in this subsection. If an appeal of a denial might remain pending on December 31 of the year in which it is filed, then in such an event, the beneficiary applicant shall file a new application for a license or approval of an ownership interest for the next succeeding calendar year under the terms of this Chapter. 
                  D.	All other changes in an ownership interest in an adult entertainment establishment or a license issued under this Chapter must be reported in writing to the City's chief of police or his designee prior to such transfer, and the person who is intended to receive such ownership interest shall be required to make an application for a license as if he or she were applying for a new license hereunder. No licensee may change the location of the licensee's operation; any change in location shall require application for a new license under this Chapter, so that such application process is completed before the relocation takes place. 
                  E.	A License to operate an Adult Entertainment Business must be applied for and held in the name of the person, group, unincorporated association, firm, partnership, Limited Liability Company or corporation that actually operates the Business. 
                  F.	A separate License shall be required for each Facility of an Adult Entertainment Business.

                  Whenever it shall be recognized by the City Administrator, or suggested by any person, that the release of population counts results in the availability of one or more additional licenses, and it is determined by the City Administrator that one or more additional licenses are available, the City shall publish a notice, one time, advising the public of such, and that applications will be received for a period of 45 days subsequent to the publication. 
                  If, during this period, applications are received which exceed the number of newly available licenses, there shall be held a lottery, administered by City Administrator, to determine the order in which applications shall be processed. Thereafter, the applications shall be processed in the order reflected in the results of the lottery. Once the processing of applications has resulted in the issuance of licenses up to the limit contained in this Chapter, the remaining applications shall be returned to the applicants, unprocessed. 
                  If no applications are received during the forty-five-day period after publication, applications shall thereafter be processed in the order in which they may thereafter be received.

                  1.	Conviction of, or the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by, the licensee or any of his or her employees or any person holding an interest in the license for any felony, any law, administrative regulation or ordinance involving alcoholic beverages, gambling or narcotics, or tax laws.

                  4.	Material falsification of any fact given in an application for a license issued under this chapter or bearing upon the licensee's qualification therefor; any act which may be construed as a subterfuge in an effort to circumvent any of the qualifications for a license under this chapter shall be deemed a violation of the requirement attempted to be circumvented; 
                  5.	Failure to meet or maintain any standard prescribed by this chapter as a condition or qualification for holding a license;

                  b)	Provided, however, such presumption may be rebutted only by evidence which precludes every other reasonable hypothesis save that such licensee did not know, assist or aid in such occurrence, or in the exercise of full diligence that such licensee could not have discovered or prevented such activity.

Formal rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings under this section, although the Mayor shall have the right to exclude evidence which carries no indicia of reliability. All testimony shall be offered under oath or affirmation. 
                  E.	The Mayor and Council shall make its final determination within 10 days of the completion of the hearing. The decision shall be placed in writing and contain the Mayor and Council's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and decision as to penalty, if any. Such penalty may include one or more of the following: revocation of the license; suspension of the license for no more than 12 months; imposition of a probationary period not to exceed 12 months, and/or a civil penalty for a first offense not to exceed $1,000 and for second and subsequent offenses, not to exceed $5,000. Where a probationary period is imposed which exceeds the term of the current license, the Mayor and Council may provide provisional conditions for a renewal license. 
                  F.	The Mayor and Council's decision shall be personally served upon the licensee or mailed by first class mail to the licensee's attorney and City Attorney within 10 days of the close of the hearing. Action taken by the Mayor and Council following the hearing shall be final.

The failure to make such request and verification in any case where the person to whom the alcoholic beverage is sold or otherwise furnished is less than 21 years of age may be considered by the trier of fact in determining whether the person selling or otherwise furnishing such alcoholic beverage did so knowingly.

A person commits the offense of loitering or prowling when one is in a place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under the circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity. 
                  B.	Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon the appearance of a law enforcement officer, refuses to identify himself or herself, or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object. Unless flight by the person or other circumstances makes it impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or immediate concern which would otherwise by warranted by requesting the person to identify himself or herself and explain his or her presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this section if the law enforcement officer failed to comply with the foregoing procedure, or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person charged was true and would have dispelled the alarm or immediate concern.

Each parking meter installed shall indicate by a proper legend the legal parking time established by the city, and, when operated, shall indicate on and by its dial and pointer the duration of the period of legal parking, and on the expiration of such period shall indicate such expiration. 
                  C.	Designation of parking spaces. The city administrator and the public works director shall have lines or markings painted or placed upon the curb or upon the street adjacent to each parking meter for the purpose of designating the parking space for which the meter is to be used.

Upon the deposit of such coin or coins and the placing of such meter in operation, the parking space may be lawfully occupied by such vehicle during the period of parking time which has been purchased, as indicated on the meter, for the part of the street in which the parking space is located. If such vehicle shall remain parked in any such parking space beyond the parking time limit fixed for such parking space, the parking meter shall, by its dial and pointer, indicate such illegal parking by displaying the word "expired," and, in that event, such vehicle shall be considered as parked overtime and beyond the period of legal parking time. 
                  F.	Overtime parking. It shall be unlawful for any person to cause, allow or permit any vehicle registered in the name of or operated by such person to be parked overtime or beyond the period of legal parking time established for any parking meter zone, as described in this article, or to deposit in any parking meter any coin for the purpose of parking beyond the maximum legal parking time for the particular parking meter zone.

                  J.	Use of coins deposited. The amount of the coins required to be deposited in parking meters is hereby levied and assessed as a fee to provide for the proper regulation, control and inspection of traffic upon the public streets; to cover the cost of supervising, regulating and inspecting the parking of vehicles in the parking meter zones; the cost of placing and maintaining lines or markings, designating parking spaces in parking meter zones; and the cost of the purchase, supervision, inspection, installation, operation, maintenance, control and use of the parking meters installed in accordance with this article and for other purposes.

                  Title 11 - STORMWATER UTILITY 
                  CHAPTER 11.04 - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 

                  Sections: 
                  11.04.010 - Findings. 
                  The City Council of the City of McDonough, Georgia makes the following findings: 
                  A.	The professional engineering and financing analyses, prepared by ARCADIS US, Inc., properly assesses and defines the stormwater management problems, needs, goals, program priorities and funding opportunities of the City. 
                  B.	Given the problems, needs, goals, program priorities, and funding opportunities identified in the professional engineering and financing analyses, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater systems in McDonough in concert with other water resource management programs. 
                  C.	Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the corporate limits of McDonough. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the corporate limits of McDonough is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
                  D.	The stormwater needs in the City of McDonough include, but are not limited to, protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. Provision of stormwater management programs and facilities renders and/or results in both service and benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of McDonough in a variety of ways as identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses. The service and benefit rendered or resulting from provision of stormwater management systems and facilities may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater systems and programs, and risk exposure. 
                  E.	The City of McDonough presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness of the existing stormwater systems owned and operated by the City, and of additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the City to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities in McDonough in concert with the management of other water resources in the City. In order to do so, the City must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program operating and capital investment needs. 
                  F.	The City Council finds, concludes and determines that a Stormwater Management Utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering and funding stormwater management services in McDonough. 
                  G.	An equitable approach to funding stormwater management services and facilities can be provided by adopting a schedule of service charges upon properties that is related to the burden of stormwater quality control service requirements and costs posed by properties throughout the City. Such schedule of service charges can be complemented by other funding methods which address specific needs, including but not limited to, allocations of special purpose local options sales taxes to stormwater drainage improvement projects. A service charge credit is an appropriate means of adjusting service charges in recognition that private stormwater systems and/or actions can effectively reduce or eliminate the burden of stormwater quantity and quality control service requirements and costs that a property or properties pose for the City. Impervious area is the most important factor influencing stormwater service requirements and costs posed by properties throughout the City, and therefore is an appropriate parameter for calculating stormwater service charges and associated credits. In addition, the value to the stormwater utility of certain actions and practices performed by property owners and other stormwater utility customers may be recognized by credits based on other factors, including but not limited to, the avoided cost of public information and education realized by the utility when public information and education about stormwater management is provided by the public school system.

                  11.04.020 - Establishment of a Utility and Enterprise Fund. 
                  A.	There is hereby established a Stormwater Management Utility within the McDonough Utility Department which shall be responsible for stormwater management throughout the City's corporate limits, and shall provide for the management, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater systems and facilities. Such utility shall be under the direction of a Stormwater Utility Director, appointed by the City Manager. 
                  B.	The City Manager and City Clerk shall establish a stormwater enterprise fund in the City budget and accounting system, separate and apart from its General Fund, for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the utility, including but not limited to rentals, rates, charges, fees, and licenses as may be established by the City Council. All revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be deposited promptly upon receipt into the Stormwater Enterprise Fund, to be held and invested in trust for the purposes dedicated, and expended exclusively for purposes of the utility, including capital project construction. No other funds of the City shall be deposited in the Stormwater Enterprise Fund or commingled with dedicated stormwater revenues, except that other revenues, receipts, and resources not accounted for in the Stormwater Enterprise Fund, including, but not limited to, grants, transfers of City funds, loans, and bond proceeds may be combined with and applied to stormwater management capital projects as deemed appropriate by the City Council, upon recommendation of the City Manager. 
                  C.	The City Council hereby transfers to the Stormwater Utility Director operational control over the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and heretofore operated by the City and other related assets, including but not limited to properties upon which such facilities are located, easements, rights-of-entry and access, and certain equipment.

                  11.04.030 - Definitions. 
                  Except as specifically defined in this chapter, all words used in this title have their customary dictionary definitions. For the purpose of this title, certain words or terms used are defined as follows: 
                  Credit shall mean a conditional reduction in the amount of a stormwater service charge to an individual property based on the provision and continuing presence of an effectively maintained and operational on-site stormwater system or facility or the provision of a service or activity by property owner, which system, facility, service, or activity reduces the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater services and facilities. The basis of such credits if granted will be defined by a specific written agreement at the determination of the City Manager as approved by action of the Mayor and City Council. 
                  Customers of the Stormwater Management Utility shall include all persons, properties, and entities served by and/or benefiting from the utility's acquisition, management, maintenance, extension, and improvement of the public stormwater management systems and facilities and regulation of public and private stormwater systems, facilities, and activities related thereto, and persons, properties, and entities which will ultimately be served or benefited as a result of the stormwater management program. 
                  Detached Dwelling Unit shall mean developed land containing one structure which is not attached to another dwelling and which contains one or more bedrooms, with a bathroom and kitchen facilities, designed for occupancy by one family. Detached dwelling units may include houses, manufactured homes, and mobile homes located on one or more individual lots or parcels of land. Developed land may be classified as a detached dwelling unit despite the presence of incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports, or small storage buildings, or the presence of a commercial use within the dwelling unit so long as such use does not result in additional impervious areas such as parking spaces, playgrounds, or structures or additions to the building which are used as offices, storage facilities, meeting rooms, classrooms, houses of worship, or similar non-residential uses. Detached dwelling unit shall not include developed land containing: structures used primarily for non-residential purposes, manufactured homes and mobile homes located within manufactured home or mobile home parks where the land is owned by others than the owners of the manufactured homes or mobile homes, or multiple dwelling unit residential properties. 
                  Developed Land shall mean all real property altered from its natural state by grading, paving, compaction, construction of structures, impervious services, or drainage works so that hydrologic response of the property is changed from that which would occur in the natural undeveloped condition. 
                  Duplexes and Triplexes shall mean developed land containing two (duplex) or three (triplex) attached residential dwelling units located on one or more parcels of land. 
                  Impervious Unit (IU) given the direct and primary relationship between stormwater runoff and imperviousness, an impervious unit is defined to serve as a common reference point for comparing various properties and attaining an equitable distribution of the cost of services and facilities through a stormwater management service charge. The impervious unit in the City of McDonough has been determined through engineering analyses to be represented by the average area of imperviousness of the developed single family residential parcels of record in 2006 in the City of McDonough. The unit has been determined to be 3,000 square feet of impervious area. The unit of 3,000 square feet of impervious area is herein after referred to as the impervious unit (IU) and is a metric that shall be used to determine and compute the service charge for all properties within McDonough. 
                  Hydrologic Response of a property is the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from a property. It is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious area; the size, shape, topographic, vegetative, and geologic conditions of a property; antecedent moisture conditions; and groundwater conditions on a property. 
                  Impervious means not allowing the passage of water through the surface on the ground or ground covering or a substantial reduction in the capacity for water to pass through the surface of the ground or ground covering as it would under natural conditions. The following types of surfaces will be considered "impervious" for purposes of the stormwater utility: the projected area of buildings; asphalt-, concrete-, brick-, or stone-paved areas; improved vehicular drives and parking areas; compacted gravel and soil surfaces; fabric or plastic coverings; and other surfaces that prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff or that change the hydrologic response of the property that existed prior to development. 
                  Multiple Dwelling Unit Residential Properties shall mean developed land whereon four or more attached residential dwelling units are located and shall include, but not limited to, apartment houses, condominiums, townhomes, attached single-family homes, boarding houses, group homes, hotels and motels, retirement centers, and other structures in which four or more family groups commonly and normally reside or could reside. In the application of stormwater service charge rates, multiple dwelling unit properties shall be treated as other developed lands. 
                  Other Developed Land shall mean, but shall not be limited to, multiple dwelling unit residential properties, manufactured home and mobile home parks, commercial and office buildings, public buildings and structures, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces, parking lots, parks, recreation properties, public and private schools and universities, research stations, hospitals and convalescent centers, airports, agricultural uses covered by impervious surfaces, water reservoirs, and water and wastewater treatment plants. 
                  Service Charges shall mean the periodic rate, fee, or charge applicable to a parcel of land, which charge shall be reflective of the service provided by the City of McDonough Stormwater Utility. Service charges are based on measurable parameters which influence the stormwater utility's cost of providing services and facilities, with the most important factor being the amount of impervious area on each parcel of land. The use of impervious area as a service charge rate parameter shall not preclude the use of other parameters, or the grouping of properties having similar characteristics through the use of ranges or rounding up or down to a consistent numerical interval, or the use of flat-rate charges for one or more classes of similarly-situated properties whose impact on the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities is relatively consistent. Stormwater service charges may also include special charges to the owners of particular properties for services or facilities uniquely related to stormwater management of that property, including but not limited to charges for development plan review, inspection of development projects and on-site stormwater control systems, and enhanced level of stormwater services above those normally provided by the City. 
                  Stormwater Management Systems shall include facilities, operations, and programs that address the issues of drainage management (flooding) and environmental quality (pollution, erosion and sedimentation) of receiving rivers, streams, creeks, lakes, ponds, and reservoirs through improvements, maintenance, regulation and funding of plants, works, instrumentalities and properties used or useful in the collection, retention, detention, and treatment of stormwater or surface water drainage. 
                  Undeveloped Land is land in its unaltered natural state or which has been modified to such minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural state shall be deemed undeveloped. Undeveloped land shall have no pavement, asphalt, or compacted gravel surfaces or structures which create an impervious surface that would prevent infiltration of stormwater or cause stormwater to collect, concentrate, or flow in a manner materially different than that which would occur if the land was in an unaltered natural state.

                  11.04.040 - Scope of Responsibility for the City Stormwater Management Utility. 
                  A.	The Stormwater Management Utility shall be responsible for stormwater management throughout the corporate limits of the McDonough City Government. The utility shall provide for the conservation, management, protection, control, use, and enhancement of stormwater through planning, acquisition, construction, installation, management, operation, maintenance, regulation, extension, and improvement of the public stormwater systems to collect, control, convey, store, detain, retain, recharge, and treat stormwater and through regulation of stormwater management systems on private property. It shall be the long-term objective of the City to provide a comparable and consistent level of stormwater service to similarly situated properties throughout the service area. 
                  B.	The City Stormwater system consists of all rivers, streams, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, channels, ditches, swales, storm sewers, culverts, inlets, catch basins, pipes, head walls and other structures, natural or man-made, within the political boundaries of the City of McDonough which control and/or convey stormwater through which the City intentionally diverts surface waters from its public streets and properties. The City owns or has legal access for purposes of operation, maintenance and improvements to those segments of this system which: 
                  (1)	Are located within public streets, rights-of-way, and easements; 
                  (2)	Are subject to easements, rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use, or other permanent provisions for adequate access for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of systems and facilities; or 
                  (3)	Are located on public lands to which the City has adequate access for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of systems and facilities. 
                  C.	Operation and maintenance of stormwater systems and facilities which are located on private property or public property not owned by the City of McDonough and for which there has been no public dedication of such systems and facilities for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of the systems and facilities shall be and remain the legal responsibility of the property owner, or its occupant, except as that responsibility may be otherwise affected by the laws of the State of Georgia and/or the United States of America. 
                  D.	It is the intent of this Ordinance to protect the public health, safety and general welfare of all properties and persons in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person or to any specified property within or without the boundaries of the City of McDonough. The City of McDonough expressly reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the City, its officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship as may now exist or hereafter be created. To the extent any permit, plan approval, inspection or similar act is required by the City as a condition precedent to any activity by or upon property not owned by the City, pursuant to this or any other regulatory ordinance, regulation or rule of the City or under Federal or State law, the issuance of such permit, plan approval, or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a warranty, express or implied, nor shall afford the basis for any action, including any action based on failure to permit or negligent issuance of a permit, seeking the imposition of money damages against the City, its officers, employees or agents.

                  11.04.050 - Requirements for On-Site Stormwater Systems; Inspections and Enforcement Methods. 
                  The appropriate and efficacious management of the stormwater management system by the City on behalf of all its citizens and in compliance with applicable state and federal law places necessary and appropriate obligations on private property owners as well. All property owners and developers of developed real property within the City of McDonough shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, and discharge stormwater in a safe manner consistent with all City of McDonough development regulations and the laws of the State of Georgia and the United States of America. The City shall have the right, pursuant to the authority of this ordinance, for its designated officers and employees to enter upon private and public property owned by entities other than the City, upon reasonable notice to the owner thereof, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests thereon in order to assure compliance. 
                  Any failure to meet the obligations set forth in this Ordinance shall constitute a nuisance and be subject to an abatement action filed by the City in the Municipal Court. In the event a public nuisance is found by the Court to exist, which the owner fails to properly abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the Court, the City may enter upon the property and cause such work as is reasonably necessary to be performed. The actual cost thereof shall be assessed against the owner in the same manner as a tax levied against the property. 
                  The City shall have lien rights from the date of the filing of the abatement action by the City, and said lien rights may be perfected through: 
                  A.	A judgment; and 
                  B.	The filing of a writ of fieri facias against all property of the person or entity against whom the assessment was made. Upon issuance of said fi. fa., and forwarding of same to the Sheriff, the Sheriff shall be authorized pursuant to Georgia law to levy same upon the property of the owner to satisfy the amount due on the judgment. 
                  These enforcement methods shall be perfected by filing a notice of lien on the General Execution Docket of the Superior Court of Henry County. A fi. fa. issued by any court in the State of Georgia can be recorded on the General Execution Docket of the Superior Court of any other county in the state in which the owner possesses property. When the execution has been entered upon the docket, the lien shall date from such entry.

                  11.04.060 - General Funding Policy. 
                  A.	It shall be the policy of the City that funding for the stormwater utility is equitably derived through methods that have demonstrable relationships to the varied demands and costs imposed on the stormwater systems and programs and/or the level of service provided as a result of the provision of stormwater services and facilities. 
                  B.	Service charges for stormwater management shall be fair and reasonable and shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing services and facilities. The cost of stormwater services and facilities may include administrative, operating, capital investment, debt service, engineering and planning, and reserve expenses, and may also include related regulatory expenses associated with watershed management requirements. Properties shall be charged rentals, rates, charges, fees, or licenses in proportion to their related cost of service impact. 
                  C.	Service charge rates shall be designed to be consistent and coordinated with the use of other funding methods employed for stormwater management by the City, whether within or outside the stormwater utility, including but not limited to plan review and inspection fees, special fees for services, fees in-lieu of regulatory requirements, impact fees, system development charges, and special assessments.

                  11.04.070 - Effective Date of Stormwater Charges. 
                  Stormwater service charges shall accrue beginning on July 16, 2007, and shall be billed periodically thereafter to customers, except as specific exemptions and credits may apply. 
                  (Ord. No. 07-07-16A, §§ 1, 2, 7-16-2007) 
                  11.04.080 - Stormwater Management Utility Service Charges. 
                  A.	There are hereby established Stormwater Management Utility service charges that shall be billed to all properties in the McDonough service area, except as specific exemptions or credits may allow for in this Ordinance or shall allow in future ordinances or amendments to this Ordinance. The Stormwater Management Utility service charges may, but are not required to, include a service rate charge applied to each property. The service rate charge, if applied, shall be related generally to the amount and quality of runoff discharged to the public stormwater systems and stormwater receiving waters and to the costs of services associated with stormwater management. The service charge may also include a base rate charge for certain costs of service common to all stormwater management accounts, and/or special service charges to persons, entities, or properties that require services and/or facilities not commonly needed by all persons, entities, or properties. 
                  B.	The service rate charge, if applied, shall be reflective of the cost of providing services and facilities to properly control stormwater runoff quantity and quality. The three most important factors in the City's present cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities to individual properties are: 
                  (1)	The size of each property; 
                  (2)	The amount of impervious area on each property; and 
                  (3)	The number of parcels in the service area. 
                  C.	A base rate charge, if applied, shall be structured to recover those stormwater management costs of service that are not related to the size of individual properties or the amount of impervious area on individual properties, and may include, but are not limited to, the cost of billing and accounting for service charges to each account and other administrative and overhead expenses. 
                  D.	Special service charges, if applied, shall be structured to recover the cost of providing to certain persons, entities, and properties types or levels of stormwater management services that are not commonly required by all stormwater service charge ratepayers. Such services may include, but are not limited to, private development plan review and inspection, site inspections to verify the operational condition of on-site stormwater management systems, such as private detention/retention and conveyance facilities, monitoring and mitigative activities related to conditions on individual properties that impact water quality, and actions to abate conditions on private properties that do not comply with adopted City standards and/or that interfere with proper stormwater management and have been determined to constitute a public nuisance. 
                  E.	The professional engineering and management analysis conducted for the City determined that properties within the City service area that are classified as single-family residential property can be equitably and fairly charged based on the median area of imperviousness. This has been established as 3,000 square feet and comprises one (1) IU. This method greatly simplifies the computation of charges and eliminates the significant costs associated with individual parcel measurements. The Mayor and City Council hereby adopts one (1) IU as representative of the conditions of single-family residential property in the City of McDonough. 
                  F.	Properties classified as non-single family residential shall be billed on the basis of the number of IU's and acres calculated or measured to exist. Each acre or fraction thereof and IU or fraction thereof shall be charged a service rate charge at the rate per IU of impervious area and each acre unit as defined below. 
                  G.	The method of calculating the service rate charge for all properties shall be as follows: 
                  Parcel Fee = (IR) X (IU's) + (AR) X (AU) + (AF) 
                  "IR" is the impervious unit rate as established by this Ordinance or by amendment to this Ordinance. It is applied to the number of parcel IU's rounded to the next whole number. An IU is defined as 3,000 square feet of impervious area. 
                  "AR" is the gross parcel area rate as established by this Ordinance or by amendment to this Ordinance. It is applied to the number of acre units (AU's) in the parcel rounded to the next whole acre. 
                  "AF" is the administrative cost factor established by this Ordinance or by amendment to this Ordinance. The AF is applied as a fixed uniform flat charge to each parcel. 
                  H.	The annual IR per IU for the service rate charge applicable to each property shall be $39.60 unless modified to equitably account for special conditions on an individual property, adjusted for a particular property through the appeal process specified in this Ordinance, or changed hereafter by Ordinance. 
                  I.	The annual AR per AU for the service rate charge applicable to each property parcel shall be $0.00 unless modified to equitably account for special conditions on an individual property, adjusted for a particular property through the appeal process specified in this Ordinance, or changed hereafter by Ordinance. 
                  J.	The annual base rate charge AF per each account shall be $0.00 unless changed hereafter by Ordinance. 
                  K.	All developed parcels meet the threshold criteria for billing. The minimum annual charge for any developed parcel shall be at least equivalent to the charges for a single-family residential parcel. 
                  L.	Undeveloped parcels shall be considered to not have any impervious area.

                  11.04.090 - Exemptions and Credits Applicable to Stormwater Service Charges. 
                  Except as provided in this Section, no public or private property shall be exempt from stormwater utility service charges or receive a credit or offset against such service charges. No exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in stormwater service charges shall be granted based on the age, tax, or economic status, race, or religion of the customer, or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater services and facilities. A Stormwater Utility Service Charge Credit Policy will be prepared by the City's consulting engineers specifying the performance standards of on-site systems, facilities, activities, and services which qualify for application of a service charge credit, and how such credits shall be calculated. The credit policy will be separately approved by the City Council and, by reference, incorporated herein. 
                  A.	Developed land other than individual detached dwelling units, including but not limited to multiple dwelling unit residential properties, manufactured home and mobile home parks, commercial and office buildings, public buildings and structures, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces, parking lots, public streets, roads, alleys, and by-ways, parks, recreation properties, public and private schools and universities, research stations, hospitals and convalescent centers, airports, agricultural uses covered by impervious surfaces, water reservoirs, and water and wastewater treatment plans may receive a stormwater service charge credit. The stormwater service charge credit shall be determined based on the requirements and standards contained in the Stormwater Utility Service Charge Credit Policy. The stormwater service charge credit shall be proportional to the extent that on-site systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner reduce or mitigate the stormwater utility's cost of providing services and facilities. 
                  B.	Groups of detached dwelling units represented by an incorporated homeowner's association providing on-site systems, facilities, services, or activities which reduce or mitigate the Stormwater Utility's cost of providing services and facilities may receive a stormwater service charge credit. The stormwater service charge credit shall be determined based on the technical requirements and standards contained in the Stormwater Utility Service Charge Credit Policy. The stormwater service charge credit available to groups of detached dwelling units shall be proportional to the extent that on-site systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and maintained by the homeowners association reduce or mitigate the stormwater utility's cost of providing services and facilities. 
                  C.	Any credit allowed against the service charge is conditioned on continuing compliance with the City's performance standards as stated in the Stormwater Utility Service Charge Credit Policy and/or upon continuing the provision of the systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner or owners upon which the credit is based. A credit may be revoked by the City at any time for non-compliance. 
                  D.	Lands in public road rights-of-way shall be exempt from service charges on condition that the managing public entity of the rights-of-way adopts an interlocal agreement with the Stormwater Management Utility for such entity to provide stormwater management of these lands.

                  11.04.100 - Stormwater Service Charge Billing, Delinquencies, Collections. 
                  A.	Stormwater Management Utility service charges shall be billed and collected in the manner and at the interval deemed most efficient by the City, and shall be payable in accordance with the rules and regulations of the City Finance Department as applied generally to all bills. A stormwater service charge bill may be sent through the United States mail or by an alternate means notifying the customer of the amount of the bill, the date the payment is due, and the past due date. Failure to receive a bill is not justification for nonpayment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each parcel of land, as shown from public land records, shall be ultimately obligated to pay such fee. If a customer is underbilled or if no bill is sent, the City may back bill for a period of up to one year, but shall not assess penalties for any delinquency. A 1.5 percent per month late charge shall be billed based on the unpaid balance of any Stormwater Management Utility service charge that becomes delinquent. 
                  B.	The stormwater service charge may be billed on a common statement and collected with other utility services through separate bills or any other method by which the City could bill other utility customers or property owners. 
                  C.	Any Stormwater Management Utility service charge or portion of a service charge not paid when due may be recovered in an action at law or equity by the City. 
                  D.	In addition to any other remedies or penalties provided by this or any other Ordinance of the City, failure to pay any utility service charge when billed in conjunction with another utility bill may result in a discontinuance of any or all other utility services provided by the City or by other with whom contractual agreements provide for discontinuance of service for nonpayment. The owner of each property, building, premises, lot, or house shall be obligated to pay such fee, which shall be enforceable by the City by action at law or equity. 
                  E.	No lien shall be imposed for delinquent collections unless a judgment is first obtained from a court of competent jurisdiction. 
                  F.	Suits for collection shall be commenced by the City in the County of the owner's residence; provided, however, if the owner is not a resident of this State, suit may be filed in the Superior or State Court of Henry County, Georgia. If a suit is instituted by the City for collection, the owner shall pay court costs, litigation expenses, and reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the City. 
                  G.	If suit is instituted for the collection of any fees due hereunder or for the enforcement of this Ordinance, the owner shall pay the court costs, litigation expenses, and reasonable attorney's fees associated therewith.

                  11.04.110 - Appeals. 
                  Any customer who believes the provisions of this Article have been applied in error may appeal in the following manner: 
                  A.	An appeal must be filed in writing with the City of McDonough Stormwater Utility Director. In the case of service charge appeals, the appeal shall include a survey prepared by a registered land surveyor or professional engineer containing information on the total property area, the impervious surface area, and any other features or conditions which influence the hydrologic response of the property to rainfall events. 
                  B.	Based on the information provided, a technical review shall be conducted by the Stormwater Utility Director of the Stormwater Management Utility and a written determination will be issued within thirty (30) days stating whether an adjustment to the service charge is appropriate and, if so, the amount of such adjustment. 
                  C.	In response to an appeal, the Stormwater Utility Director may adjust the stormwater service charge applicable to a property in conformance with the general purpose and intent of this chapter. 
                  D.	A decision of the Stormwater Utility Director which is adverse to an appellant may be further appealed to the City Manager within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice of the adverse decision. Notice of the appeal shall be served on the City Manager by the appellant, stating the grounds for the appeal. The City Manager shall issue a written decision on the appeal within thirty (30) days. All decisions of the City Manager shall be served on the appellant personally or by registered or certified mail, sent to the billing address of the appellant. 
                  E.	If the person or entity seeking adjustment or relief from the service charge desires, the decision of the City Manager may be appealed in writing to the Mayor and City Council. Such appeals must be made within thirty (30) days of the decision of the City Manager and include a written basis for the appeal. The decision of the Mayor and City Council shall be final. 
                  F.	This appeal process shall not interfere with the rights of the person or entity to seek judicial relief in a court of competent jurisdiction, but shall be exhausted before judicial relief is pursued. Any appeal to the Superior Court of Henry County must be filed within thirty (30) days of the decision of the Mayor and City Council. 
                  G.	Notices of the appeal and decisions shall be served personally or delivered by registered or certified mail to the address of record.

                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 13-07-15 , § 1, adopted July 15, 2013, repealed the former Ch. 12.08, § 12.08.010, and enacted a new Ch. 12.08 as set out herein. The former chapter pertained to parades, assemblies and picketing, and derived from Prior Code § 17-17; Ord. No. 01-08-20R, § 4, 8-20-2001. See also the Code Comparative Table.

                  PART 1. - IN GENERAL 

                  12.08.010 - Purpose and intent. 
                  The City of McDonough recognizes and supports the public's right of assembly and free speech and to utilize designated public facilities for such purposes. At the same time, the City has an important and compelling governmental interest in protecting property, public safety, health, and welfare, and controlling use of streets and other public facilities and venues. This chapter seeks to accommodate public rights of speech and assembly consistent with that governmental interest by establishing procedures, terms, and conditions for use of public areas and facilities for such purposes. A second purpose of this chapter is to facilitate and manage the manner in which public facilities that are not otherwise required for governmental operations may be made available for use on a temporary basis for non-governmental operations.

                  This chapter applies to all public parades and assemblies that may be expected to affect the public, the property or services of the City, or otherwise require an expenditure of time and expense or create the potential for liability or public disturbance or other substantial concern. This chapter also applies to requests for use of public facilities for purposes other than governmental operations. This chapter is adopted in accordance with the authority vested in the City by its Charter, Article IX, Section II, Paragraphs II and III of the Georgia Constitution, O.C.G.A. § 36-35-3 and all other applicable state and federal law.

                  12.08.040 - Administration; permit required. 
                  A.	Administration. This chapter shall be administered by the City Administrator or his or her designee. The Administrator may delegate functions related to facility use requests or parade/public assembly requests to other persons but shall retain authority under the interim appeal process established by section 12.08.160. 
                  B.	Permit requirement.

                  12.08.050 - General exceptions. 
                  A.	Permit exceptions. Permits and prior approvals under this Chapter are not required for: 
                  1.	Funeral processions; or 
                  2.	Spontaneous events involving a parade or public assembly occasioned by news or affairs coming into public knowledge within seven (7) days prior to such public assembly, provided that: 
                  a.	The event occurs on private property or a public area in a manner that does not unduly disrupt or inconvenience the public in the use of such area; 
                  b.	The organizer or sponsor thereof provides written notice to the Administrator at least 24 hours prior to the start of the parade or public assembly, or such other prior notice as may be reasonable under the circumstances. 
                  B.	Fee, expense, or other exceptions. Permits shall be required for all other parades or public assemblies or for events seeking to use public facilities. Exceptions and waivers from requirements for payment of fees and expenses, proof of insurance, bonding, or other security may be approved solely in accordance with those sections of this chapter applicable to such activities or events.

                  12.08.060 - General standards and procedures. 
                  A.	Decision-making unrelated to content of expression. To achieve the purposes of this chapter without undue interference with protected rights of speech and assembly, decisions to issue, deny, or conditionally approve permits shall not be based on the content of a message associated with the event absent a compelling governmental interest. Notwithstanding that general standard, protections otherwise applicable to speech and assembly are limited and may not extend to speech or assembly that is intended to or has the result of causing public alarm, disruption, falsehood, or other form of expression that is not protected under the laws or constitution of this state or the United States. 
                  B.	Time, place and manner controls. This chapter seeks to impose reasonable time, place and manner controls in an appropriate and limited manner upon events and facility uses for which permits are required. This chapter shall be administered in a manner that seeks to allow for expression, assembly, and the exercise of religious rights in accordance with applicable constitutional and statutory limits and controls. 
                  C.	Internal appeal step. At any point in the permit application and approval process, an applicant who feels aggrieved or substantially and adversely affected by compliance with the chapter or permit process may request review through an intermediate appeal procedure under section 12.08.160. 
                  D.	General application time frame. Except for permits involving streets, facilities, or venues, or types of events identified for either expedited processing or requiring longer-term processing as identified in section 12.08.080 or elsewhere in this chapter, applications for permits shall be filed not less than 7 days, nor more than 90 days, before the event for which the permit is sought. 
                  E.	Requirements for insurance, bonding or other security. To avoid interference with protected rights of speech and assembly, any requirement imposed for surety for performance (including but not limited to insurance, bonding, or monetary deposits) shall be based upon needs directly associated with the event and not on the basis of possible disruption of the event by protestors or other persons who might be opposed to the speech or assembly.

                  A.	The process set forth in this section includes the standard procedure and requirements that apply to all applications for permits under this chapter. Additional requirements and exceptions or waivers for specific types of permits are set forth in parts 2 and 3 of this chapter. 
                  B.	The Administrator shall create and provide application forms for each type of permit required by this chapter. The information required by the application shall be the minimum information that is required of any applicant. The application form shall include information designed to allow the City to act on the application in an informed manner to determine if the application meets the requirements of this chapter, including potential adverse effects as stated herein, and to allow the City to determine what requirements, if any, should be imposed as a condition of issuance of the permit. The Administrator may amend any application form in whole or in part on such notice as is deemed appropriate under the circumstances, provided that an amendment shall not apply to an application made prior to the Administrator's formal notice of any proposed amendment to the application form. 
                  C.	Without limiting the authority of the Administrator to require reasonable additional information in connection with any specific application, such forms shall require the applicant to identify: 
                  1.	The name, address, and telephone number of the person or the agent or representative of an organization or entity seeking to obtain the permit. 
                  2.	The names, addresses and telephone numbers of the headquarters or business location of the organization seeking the permit or organizing or sponsoring the event or activity, if any, and the authorized and responsible heads of the organization. 
                  3.	If the application is filed by any person other than an individual applying on the individual's own behalf, the application shall include written authorization from that other person or from a responsible, legally authorized representative of an organizational applicant authorizing the applicant to apply for the permit on its behalf. 
                  4.	The requested date, time, and location for the event or activity. Specifically: 
                  a.	The location description shall identify the extent of the public and private areas that will be involved in the activity or event. 
                  b.	The time shall include the time during which the event or activity will be conducted and the time(s) during which preparation, set-up, assembly, clean-up or other actions may occur. 
                  5.	The approximate number of persons who are anticipated to attend or participate in the activity or event, including a separate list of the number of any anticipated spectators, protestors, or counter-demonstrators, as appropriate. 
                  6.	A description of the activity or event, including a description of specific activities planned during the event. 
                  7.	A description of any recording equipment, sound amplification equipment, banners, signs, or other attention-getting signs or devices to be used in connection with the event. 
                  8.	A description of any additional public facilities or equipment to be utilized in connection with the event. 
                  D.	Any person seeking a permit shall file a completed application with the Administrator within the time frame required by this chapter or as stated on the application form, whichever time provides greater opportunity for review of the application by the City. The application shall be signed by the applicant or the applicant's duly authorized representative or agent under oath or affirmation.

                  12.08.080 - Expedited or extended application review. 
                  A.	Expedited review. Upon request of an applicant, the Administrator may agree to an expedited application review when the applicant demonstrates that compliance with the standard review process (1) is not required due to size, location, duration or other appropriate factors indicating that public safety, welfare, and convenience would not be affected by expedited review or (2) would substantially burden protected rights, including speech and assembly, as to matters of public concern and the expedited review process would allow reasonable review to address substantial matters of public safety, welfare, and convenience. 
                  B.	Extended review. Upon determining that the size, location, duration, or other appropriate factors that affect public safety, welfare, and convenience, require more intensive review of an application, the Administrator, after notice to the applicant, may extend the standard review period by a time not to exceed 48 hours.

                  A.	A non-refundable application-processing fee of $50.00 to cover administrative costs of processing the permit application shall be paid to the City by the applicant when the application is filed. 
                  B.	Rental fees, service charges, or costs shall be payable according to the schedule set by the City, as may be amended from time to time by resolution of Mayor and Council, copies of which shall be kept on file in the office of the City Clerk, the Community Development Department, and such other departments as may be required by the Administrator.

                  A.	Police protection. 
                  1.	If possible, without disruption of ordinary police services or compromise of public safety and welfare, regularly scheduled on-duty police personnel shall cover the event. The Administrator shall seek review of any application which might require additional police personnel by the Police Chief. 
                  2.	When reviewing an application, the Police Chief shall determine whether and to what extent additional police protection is reasonably necessary for the event for traffic control and public safety and welfare, including public convenience. The Police Chief shall base this decision on relevant criteria including, but not limited to, the size, location, duration, time and date of the event; the number of streets and intersections blocked; and the need to detour or preempt public travel and use of streets and sidewalks. 
                  3.	The speech content of the event shall not be a factor in determining the amount of police protection necessary. 
                  4.	If additional police protection for the event is deemed necessary by the Police Chief, he shall so inform the Administrator and applicant. The applicant shall be responsible for bearing the cost of any additional police protection deemed necessary. The Chief may, but is not required to, approve use of private security details in lieu of any or all special detail municipal police services that might otherwise be required under this section. 
                  B.	Public works. In the same manner, the City shall determine if the applicant shall be required to pay for or provide additional public works-related actions such as lighting, refuse receptacles and pick-up, sanitary facilities, traffic control signs, devices, or personnel. 
                  C.	Other expenses. In circumstances where the event itself may be expected to cause the City to incur additional, extraordinary expenses, the Administrator shall identify such expenses and the basis for determining them to be extraordinary. Such expenses may be imposed upon the applicant as a condition of approval of the permit. 
                  D.	Expense exception. An applicant for an event conducted for the sole purpose of public issued speech protected under the First Amendment or the Georgia Constitution as determined by the Administrator shall not be required to pay for police protection or public works or other expenses for actions provided by the City. However, the applicant shall obtain a permit as required by this Chapter.

                  In addition to standards applicable to particular events or activities under other provisions of this chapter, a permit shall be issued when, from a consideration of the application and from such other information as may otherwise be obtained, the Administrator finds that: 
                  A.	The application is complete and sets forth accurately and in sufficient detail the information required for consideration. 
                  B.	Conduct of the event will not unduly inconvenience either the public in using public areas normally open for general public use or the City in the conduct of governmental operations. 
                  C.	Adequate sanitation and other required health facilities are or will be made available in or adjacent to the area in which the event will be held. 
                  D.	There are sufficient parking places near the site of the event to accommodate the number of vehicles reasonably expected. 
                  E.	The applicant has secured police protection or otherwise arranged for event security, if any, required under section 12.08.100. 
                  F.	The applicant has paid or provided for payment of any expenses or costs as may be required under section 12.08.100 or other provisions of this chapter. 
                  G.	No event is scheduled elsewhere in the City where municipal resources (including but not limited to law enforcement, fire, or public works personnel) required for the events are so great that their deployment would have an immediate and adverse effect upon the welfare and safety of persons and property. 
                  H.	No permit may be issued that allows for the erection or placement of any structure, whether permanent or temporary, on a municipal street, sidewalk, or right-of-way unless advance approval for the erection or placement of the structure is obtained from the Mayor and Council.

                  The Administrator shall uniformly consider each application upon its merits and shall not discriminate in granting or denying permits under this chapter based upon political, religious, ethnic, race, disability, sexual orientation or gender-related grounds or other criteria that would constitute a violation of state or federal law.

                  Regularly held and scheduled events that would otherwise require issuance of a permit under this chapter may receive longer-term approvals, not to exceed three (3) years in duration, that will constitute permit approval under this chapter. Such longer-term approvals may be issued if the Administrator finds that: 
                  A.	The events are to be held in an approved location; and 
                  B.	The Police Chief, Fire Chief, Public Works Director each have reviewed the location and schedule for the proposed events and have notified the Administrator that they have no objection to the conduct of the events according to the schedule proposed. 
                  C.	Any approvals under this section shall be subject to modification or termination upon a determination by the Administrator of changed conditions, circumstances or needs of the City. Any modification or termination of a continuing permit shall be subject to the appeal process in section 12.08.160, and shall not prevent the applicant from applying for a permit under the remaining provisions of this Chapter.

                  A.	Upon receiving an application, the Administrator shall determine within 48 hours if the application is complete or if any additional preliminary information is required and shall so inform the applicant. The applicant shall provide such required information prior to further consideration of the application. The requirement to supplement the application at this stage does not prevent the City from requiring additional information during its review and action upon the application. 
                  B.	After accepting an application, the Administrator shall forward it for review and recommendation to the Police Chief and to any other municipal employee, official, or board deemed appropriate. Such review and recommendation shall occur within 5 days unless that period is extended by the Administrator. 
                  C.	The Administrator also may refer the application for review by other governmental entities (e.g., county, regional, or state authorities) as deemed appropriate. 
                  D.	After receiving comments and recommendations from such reviews and after considering such other information as deemed appropriate, the Administrator may require the applicant to submit additional information or respond to the reviews and recommendations or impose such conditions as are appropriate under the circumstances. 
                  E.	Upon completion of the foregoing, the Administrator shall act on the application. The Administrator may approve, amend, approve with conditions, or deny the application. For any action other than approval as submitted, the Administrator shall include a brief summary of the reasons for the decision. 
                  F.	Unless otherwise provided in this Chapter or agreed to by the applicant, the Administrator shall act on an application within 7 days after determining that the application is complete in accordance with paragraph (A) of this section. If a completed application has been submitted in a timely manner, the Administrator shall act upon the application and provide notice to the applicant in accordance with section 12.08.150 not later than 2 days prior to the event. 
                  G.	The administrator may authorize the conduct of the event at a date, time, location, or route different from that proposed by the applicant. An applicant desiring to accept such an alternate permit shall so notify the Administrator in writing not less than 3 days after notice of the Administrator's action. An alternate permit shall conform to the requirements of, and shall have the effect of, a permit issued under this Chapter. 
                  H.	A person aggrieved and directly affected by a decision of the Administrator under this section may file an interim or final administrative appeal pursuant to section 12.08.160.

                  A.	Interim appeal. Prior to a final decision by the Administrator, an applicant who claims that delay, imposition of conditions, or other action by the City violates any applicable law, or unreasonably and improperly interferes with constitutionally protected rights, may file an interim appeal as follows: 
                  1.	The applicant shall notify the Administrator in writing of the claim specifying in detail the basis for the claim. The Administrator shall review the notice and determine if administrative action will adequately resolve the problem. 
                  2.	If the applicant is not satisfied by such administrative action, the applicant may file a written appeal within 48 hours to the Mayor, with a copy to the City Clerk specifying the grounds for the appeal. The Mayor shall review the appeal to determine if he or she will hear the matter or if he or she determines that grounds for appeal are not properly set forth. 
                  3.	If the Mayor determines that the appeal will not be heard, he or she shall notify the applicant within 24 hours of such decision. If the appeal proceeds, the Mayor shall schedule a hearing on the matter within 2 days with such notice to the applicant as is deemed appropriate under the circumstances. At the hearing, the Mayor shall hear the applicant, Administrator, and such other persons as may be allowed to speak. Within 48 hours after the hearing, the Mayor shall issue his or her decision in writing and shall so notify the applicant.

The applicant or any person directly affected by final administrative action on an application may file a written appeal with the City Council, with a copy to the City Clerk not later than 3 days after the final action. The appeal shall state with specificity the grounds for the appeal. The City Council may deny an appeal without hearing if it determines on the face of the appeal that it has no merit and shall so notify the appellant and other directly affected parties within 48 hours after such determination. If the appeal proceeds, the City Council shall schedule a hearing within 14 days. The appeal hearing shall be limited to the grounds stated in the appeal unless the City Council for good cause determines to hear other issues or concerns. The appellant, applicant (if not the appellant), the Administrator and other persons directly affected may speak or submit evidence at the hearing. The City Council may determine who is permitted to participate in the hearing. The City Council shall issue its decision on the appeal, stating the reasons for its decision, within 5 days after the hearing.

Whenever an applicant believes that the time normally required for action on a permit under paragraph (A) will interfere with protected rights of speech or assembly or would render ineffective the purpose for which the event is proposed, the applicant shall include in the application a written request for expedited review, including a description of the basis therefor. The Administrator shall promptly review such request and, unless it is determined that cause for expedited review is not stated, shall grant expedited review within such time as may be reasonably required to meet the purposes of this chapter.

                  A.	Participation. An event for which a permit is issued to a private entity that is not part of the local government of the City or an event that is not sponsored directly or indirectly by the City shall not be deemed state or governmental action.

                  12.08.410 - Security for performance. 
                  A permit issued under this Chapter may be conditioned upon the permittee providing surety for performance of obligations under this Chapter or associated with specific terms or conditions of the permit. The Administrator shall determine the amount of the surety after review and consultation with appropriate municipal employees and officials. The surety shall be intended to secure payment of any costs that might be incurred by the City that should be the responsibility of the permittee. The need to use security for performance shall be stated by the Administrator in the permit. Any applicant may provide evidence of inability to obtain surety which, if shown, shall be cause for the Administrator to waive such requirements in the interest of permitting protected speech or assembly to proceed.

                  If a permittee fails to pay costs or take actions required under this Chapter, the City, after requesting payment from the permittee, may draw upon any security provided under section 12.08.410 or may seek to recover such costs from the permittee or other responsible person by appropriate legal action. If the City prevails in any such action for recovery, it shall be entitled to reimbursement of any costs incurred in seeking such recovery, including court costs and attorneys' fees. Cost recovery from permittees and participants shall be focused upon the conduct of the permittees and authorized participants and not on conduct of observers or others over whom permittee cannot reasonably be expected to exercise control.

The Administrator may suspend or revoke any permit issued under this Chapter upon finding any violation of this Chapter, the terms or conditions imposed in the permit, or for any other action deemed detrimental to public health and safety. Such revocation shall take effect immediately, and the Administrator shall promptly notify the permittee of revocation. After revocation, the permittee may not conduct the event, or if the event has commenced, shall immediately cause the event to be terminated in a safe, proper manner. 
                  B.	If a public emergency arises where City resources required for the emergency are so great that deployment of City personnel, equipment or services for a parade or public assembly would have an immediate, adverse effect upon welfare and safety of persons or property, the Administrator may suspend or revoke the permit and the permittee shall comply with such directives as the Administrator may impose.

                  2.	are reasonably expected on the basis of historical funding patterns to be made available to pay for system improvements of the same category and in the same service area for which an impact fee is imposed. 
                  C.	The method of calculating impact fees for public facilities under this Ordinance shall be maintained for public inspection as a part of the official records of the City of McDonough, Georgia, and may be amended from time to time by official act. 
                  D.	In addition to the cost of new or expanded system improvements needed to be built to serve new development, the cost basis of a development impact fee shall also include the proportionate cost of existing system. 
                  E.	Improvements to the extent that such public facilities have excess service capacity and new development will be served by such facilities. 
                  F.	Development impact fees shall be based on actual system improvement costs or reasonable estimates of such costs, as set forth in the Capital Improvements Element of the Comprehensive Plan. 
                  (Ord. No. 03-07-21, § I, 7-21-2003)

Payment of a development impact fee pursuant to the fee schedule attached hereto as Attachment A for a property located inside of the City of McDonough, shall constitute full and complete payment of the project's proportionate share of system improvements and shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this Ordinance. 
                  B.	When a land development activity for which an application for a building permit has been made includes two or more buildings, structures or other land uses in any combination, including two or more uses within a building or structure, the total development impact fee shall be the sum of the fees for each and every building, structure, or use, including each and every use within a building or structure. 
                  C.	In the event that an applicant contends that the land use category of the proposed development is not shown on the fee schedule or fits within a different category, then: 
                  D.	The Administrator in his sole discretion shall make a determination as to the appropriate land use designation and the appropriate development impact fee. 
                  E.	In making such determination, the Administrator may require such additional information from the applicant as necessary to form a logical fee determination relative to the impact fees shown on the adopted fee schedule. 
                  F.	If a land use designation is not in a category contained in this Ordinance, then an appropriate new category may be added by the Administrator and an appropriate fee established under the City's current impact fee methodology, subject to annual confirmation by the Mayor and Council. 
                  G.	Appeals from the decision of the Administrator shall be made to the Mayor and Council within 30 days of the Administrator's decision.

                  D.	If the final use of a building cannot be determined at the time of the initial building permit, the Administrator shall have the authority to assess a development impact fee based on the most likely use of the building, and shall adjust the fee in accordance with the actual use prior to issuance of an interior finishes permit or approval of a Certificate of Occupancy. 
                  E.	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Ordinance, any future change in demand for public facilities in excess of the average demand anticipated at the time of issuance of the building permit shall be assessed such additional fee as would otherwise have been due. Future changes in demand may result from a change in the land use category of the occupant of the building or property, the expansion of a building or use on a property that results in an increase in the units of development (as defined herein), or the subsequent discovery of facts unknown or misrepresented at the time of issuance of the building permit.

                  3.	provide any other written specifications as may be reasonably required by the Administrator to substantiate the individual assessment determination. 
                  C.	The Administrator in his sole discretion shall determine whether the content of an individual assessment study satisfies the requirements of this Ordinance. A negative determination by the Administrator may be appealed to the Mayor and Council for a final decision. 
                  D.	Any fee approved as an individual assessment determination shall have standing for 180 days following the date of approval.

                  2.	For any contribution or dedication of land for system improvements by a developer or his predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the County, the original value of the land shall be the same as that attributed to the property by the validated tax appraisal at the time of dedication, from which present value may be calculated. 
                  3.	For any contribution of capital equipment that qualifies as a system improvement by a developer or his predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the City, the value shall be the original cost to the developer of the capital equipment or the cost that the City of McDonough, Georgia would normally pay for such equipment, whichever is less. 
                  4.	For any contribution of money for system improvements from a developer or his predecessor in title or interest accepted by the City, the original value of the money shall be the same as that at the time of contribution, from which present value may be calculated.

                  15.05.060 - Complaint in rem in municipal court; procedure; lien; appeal. 
                  A.	Whenever a request is filed with a public officer by a public authority or by at least five residences of the municipality charging that any dwelling, building, structure or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer may make an investigation or inspection of the specific dwelling, building, structure, or property and make a written report of his or her findings.

                  B.	If the public officer's investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer shall file a complaint in rem in the municipal court of the city against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building, or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general nuisance exists and shall cause summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the interested parties in such dwelling, building, or structure, as well as a lis pendens to be filed in the Superior Court of Henry County. The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; identify the interested parties; state with particularity the factual basis for the action; and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance.

The interested parties shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for hearing. 
                  C.	If, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state, in writing, findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order: 
                  1.	If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the city violation; and if applicable, to secure by closing the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  2.	If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property. 
                  For purposes of this section, the court shall make its determination of reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered; and, provided further, that if the unsatisfactory condition is limited solely to the presence of graffiti, the dwelling, building, or structure shall not be ordered demolished or closed, but its owner may be ordered to repair the same by cleaning or removal of the graffiti. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. title 43, chapter 39A, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction. 
                  D.	If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the public officer shall cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved, or to be vacated and closed, or demolished within 270 days of the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to subsection C of this section or any equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action shall commence. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  E.	If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and governing authority are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
                  F.	The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
                  G.	The lien provided for in subsection F shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court in Henry County and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under subsection B. The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall, within 90 days of the completion of repairs, demolition or closure, forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the county tax commissioner. 
                  H.	It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. § 48-4-5; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply; provided, further, that redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. The tax commissioner may initiate enforcement of liens imposed under this section at any time following receipt of the final determination of costs from the public officer. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. 
                  I.	The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the municipality whose ordinance is being enforced. The tax commissioner may retain an amount equal to the cost of administering collection of the lien. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of administering the lien. 
                  J.	The governing authority may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
                  K.	Review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29.

                  2.

Copies of the complaint and summons shall also be mailed by first-class mail to the property address to the attention of the occupants, if any; 
                  3.	For interested parties whose mailing address is unknown, a notice stating the date, time, and place of the hearing shall be published in the newspaper in which the sheriff's advertisements appear in such county once a week for two consecutive weeks prior to the hearing; and 
                  4.	A notice of lis pendens shall be filed in the office of the clerk of superior court in which the dwelling, building, structure, or property is located at the time of filing the complaint in municipal court. 
                  B.	The public officer shall cause an affidavit of service to be filed of record in the municipal court prior to the hearing showing compliance with the service requirements of this section. Such affidavit shall constitute a prima facie showing of minimum procedural due process and shall constitute sufficient proof that service was perfected. 
                  C.	Orders and other filings made subsequent to service of the initial complaint shall be served in the manner provided in this section on every interested party who answers the complaint or appears at the hearing. Any interested party who fails to answer or appear at the hearing shall be deemed to have waived all further notice in the proceedings.

Notice of the hearing shall be published in the principal newspaper of local circulation in the county and written notice of the hearing shall be mailed by the commission to all owners and published notice shall be provided in the same manner and time frame as notices are provided before a public hearing to consider a rezoning application. 
                  2.	At the public hearing, the property owner(s) and/or applicant for a certificate of appropriateness shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard. 
                  F.	Acceptable Commission Reaction to Applications for Certificate of Appropriateness. The commission may approve the application for a certificate of appropriateness as proposed, approve the application subject to any conditions which it deems necessary, or deny the application. 
                  1.	The commission shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material change(s) in the appearance would not have a substantial adverse impact on the aesthetic, historic or architectural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district. In making this determination, the commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the following criteria for each of the following acts: 
                  a.	Reconstruction, Alteration, New Construction or Renovation. The commission shall issue certificates of appropriateness for the above proposed actions if those actions conform in design, scale, building material, setback and landscaping as further specified in the design guidelines for the city, which shall be developed by the commission, and to the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings. 
                  b.	Relocation. A decision by the commission approving or denying a certificate of appropriateness for the relocation of a building, structure or object shall be guided by: 
                  i.	The historic character and aesthetic interest the building, structure or object contributes to its present setting; 
                  ii.	Whether there are definite plans for the area to be vacated and what the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area will be; 
                  iii.	Whether the building, structure or object can be moved without significant damage to its physical integrity; 
                  iv.	Whether the proposed relocation area is compatible with the historical and architectural character of the building, structure, site or object. 
                  c.	Demolition. A decision by the commission approving or denying a certificate of appropriateness for the demolition of buildings, structures, sites or objects shall be guided by: 
                  i.	The historic, scenic or architectural significance of the building, structure, site or object; 
                  ii.	The importance of the building, structure, site or object to the ambiance of a district; 
                  iii.	The difficulty or the impossibility of reproducing such a building, structure, site or object because of its design, texture, material, details or unique location; 
                  iv.	Whether the building, structure, site or object is one of the last remaining examples of its kind in the neighborhood, in the city, or in Henry County; 
                  v.	Whether there are definite plans for reuse of the property if the proposed demolition is carried out, and what the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area would be; 
                  vi.	Whether reasonable measures can be taken to save the building, structure, site or object from collapse; 
                  vii.	Whether the building, structure, site or object is capable of earning reasonable economic return on its value. 
                  G.	Undue Hardship. When, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this chapter would result in the exceptional practical difficulty or undue economic hardship upon any owner of a specific property, the commission, when approving an application, shall have the power to grant a variance from the strict terms of these provisions, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided, however, that such variances shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the provisions, so that the architectural or historic integrity, or character of the property, shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variances, the commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgment, best fulfill the purpose of this chapter. An undue hardship shall not be a situation of the person's own making. 
                  H.	Deadline for Approval or Rejection of Application for Certificate of Appropriateness. 
                  1.	The commission shall approve or reject an application for a certificate of appropriateness within forty-five (45) days after the filing thereof by the owner or occupant of an historic property, or of a building, structure, site or object located within an historic district. Evidence of approval shall be by a certificate of appropriateness issued by the commission. Notice of the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness shall be sent by United States Mail to the applicant and all other persons who have requested such notice in writing filed with the commission. 
                  2.	Failure of the commission to act within the forty-five (45) day period shall constitute approval of the certificate of appropriateness, and no other evidence of approval shall be needed. 
                  I.	Necessary Action to be Taken by Commission Upon Rejection of Application for Certificate of Appropriateness. 
                  1.	In the event the commission rejects an application, it shall state its reasons for doing so, and shall transmit a record of such actions and reasons, in writing, to the applicant. The commission may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves of the application submitted. The applicant, if he or she so desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so. 
                  2.	In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of the application for a certificate of appropriateness by the commission shall be binding upon the building inspector or designee charged with issuing building permits and, in such a case, no building permit shall be issued. 
                  J.	Requirement of Conformance With Certificate of Appropriateness. 
                  1.	All work performed pursuant to an issued certificate of appropriateness shall conform to the requirements of such certificate. In the event work is performed not in accordance with such certificate, the commission shall issue a cease and desist order and all work shall cease. 
                  2.	The city council or the commission shall be authorized to institute any appropriate action or proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent any material change in appearance of a designated historic property or historic distric,t except those changes made in compliance with the provisions of this chapter or to prevent any illegal act or conduct with respect to such historic property or historic district. 
                  K.	Certificate of Appropriateness Void if Construction Not Commenced. A certificate of appropriateness shall become void unless construction is commenced within six months of date of issuance. Certificates of appropriateness shall be issued for a period of twelve (12) months and are renewable. 
                  L.	Recording of Applications for Certificate of Appropriateness. The commission shall keep a public record of all applications for certificates of appropriateness, and of all the commission's proceedings in connection with the application. 
                  M.	Acquisition of Property. The commission may, where such action is authorized by the mayor and city council and is reasonably necessary or appropriate for the preservation of a unique historic property, enter into negotiations with the owner for the acquisition by gift, purchase, exchange or otherwise, to the property or any interest therein. 
                  N.	Appeals. Any person adversely affected by any determination made by the commission relative to the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness may appeal such determination to the city council. Any such appeal must be filed within fifteen (15) days after the issuance of the determination pursuant the provisions found elsewhere in this chapter or, in the case of a failure of the commission to act, within fifteen (15) days of the expiration of the forty-five (45) day period allowed for commission action, as provided in this chapter.

                  15.44.060 - Maintaining of historic properties and building and zoning code provisions. 
                  A.	Ordinary Maintenance or Repair. Ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural or environmental feature in or on an historic property to correct deterioration, decay or damage, or to sustain the existing form, and that does not involve a material change in design, material or outer appearance thereof, does not require a certificate of appropriateness. 
                  B.	Failure to Provide Ordinary Maintenance or Repair. Property owners of historic properties or properties within historic districts shall not allow their buildings to deteriorate by failing to provide ordinary maintenance or repair. The commission shall be charged with the following responsibilities regarding deterioration by neglect: 
                  1.	The commission shall monitor the condition of historic properties and existing buildings in historic districts to determine if they are being allowed to deteriorate by neglect. Such conditions as broken windows, doors and openings which allow the elements and vermin to enter, and/or the deterioration of a building's structural system shall constitute failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair. 
                  2.	In the event the commission determines a failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair, the commission will notify the owner of the property and specify the steps which need to be taken to remedy the violation. The violation must be corrected within thirty (30) days of notification by the commission. 
                  3.	In the event that the violation is not remedied within thirty (30) days, the owner shall be punished as provided in this chapter and, at the direction of the city council, the commission may perform such maintenance or repair as necessary to prevent deterioration by neglect. The owner of the property shall be liable for the cost of such maintenance and repair performed by the commission. 
                  C.	Affirmation of Existing Building and Zoning Codes. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as to exempt property owners from comply with existing city building codes, nor to prevent any property owner from making any use of his property not prohibited by other statutes, ordinances or regulations.

                  Any person or firm who shall violate any of the other terms and regulations of this chapter shall, upon conviction, be fined not less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00), nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00), or be imprisoned for a period not to exceed ten days. Each and every day the violation exists shall be considered a separate offense.

                  CHAPTER 15.48 - MIXED USE-COMMERCIAL/RESIDENTIAL (MU-CR) OVERLAY SPECIFICATIONS 

                  Sections: 
                  15.48.010 - Intent and Purposes.

                  15.48.050 - Limitations. 
                  A.	Each and every property owner wishing to utilize the provisions of this chapter may do so only after filing an application with the Community Development Department and receiving approval thereof. Such application shall consist of three phases. The first phase consists of payment of a nonrefundable inspection fee for each building anticipated for residential use and performance by the city of an inspection of each building anticipated for such use, which shall result in a detailed list of required improvements, if any, which must be made prior to final approval. The Enforcement Authority shall take the following into consideration in determining required improvements: 
                  1.	Hazardous Conditions. With reference to existing buildings, enforcement authorities should assure that any of the conditions or defects described in this section are identified and corrected in a matter deemed reasonably appropriate by the enforcement authority through the utilization the applicable minimum standards or, if necessary, of appropriate compliance alternatives: 
                  a.	Structural. Any building or structure or portion thereof which is in imminent danger of collapse because of, but not limited to the following factors: 
                  (1)	Dilapidation, deterioration, or decay; 
                  (2)	Faulty structural design or construction; 
                  (3)	The removal, movement, or instability of any portion of the ground necessary for the purpose of supporting such building; or 
                  (4)	The deterioration, decay, or inadequacy of the foundation. 
                  b.	Number of exits. Less than two (2) approved independent, remote and properly protected exit ways serving every story of a building, except where a single exit way is permitted by the applicable state or local fire or building code or life safety codes; and if acceptable alternative safeguards cannot be met, an automatic fire suppression system shall be provided. 
                  c.	Capacity of exists. Any required door, aisle, passageway, stairway, or other means of egress which is not of sufficient capacity to serve the population of the portions of the building served and which is not so arranged as to provide safe and adequate means of egress to a place of safety. 
                  d.	Mechanical Systems. Utilities and mechanical systems not in conformance with the codes in effect at the time of construction of a building which creates a serious threat of fire or threaten the safety of the occupants of the building. 
                  2.	Additions to Existing Building. Additions to an existing building shall comply with the applicable requirements of state and local laws, rules, regulations, codes, and standards for new construction. Such additions shall not impose upon existing structure loads either vertical or horizontal which would cause the existing building to be subjected to stresses exceeding those that would be permitted under new construction. If the existing building does not comply with the standards provided in this section and the authorized enforcement authority finds that the addition adversely affects the performance of the total building, the authorized enforcement authority may require: 
                  a.	The new addition to be separated from the existing structure by at least a two-hour fire wall with openings therein properly protected; or 
                  b.	The installation of an approved automatic fire suppression system; or 
                  c.	Other remedies which may be deemed appropriate by the enforcement authority. 
                  3.	Minor Alterations and New Mechanical Systems. Minor alterations or repairs to an existing building which do not adversely affect the performance or safety of the building may be made with the same or like materials. Existing buildings which, in part or as a whole, exceed the requirements of any applicable construction or fire safety code, may, in the course of compliance with this chapter, have reduced or removed, in part or total, features not required by such code for new construction; provided, however, that such features were not a specific condition of prior approval. Existing buildings and structures which, in part or as a whole, do not meet the requirements of the then existing code for new construction may be altered or repaired without further compliance to any such code by utilizing the provisions of this chapter, provided their present degree of compliance to any applicable then existing construction of or fire safety code is not reduced. Any new mechanical systems installed in an existing building shall conform to then existing codes for new construction to the fullest extent practical, except as approved by the authorized enforcement authorities pursuant to the authority of this chapter. 
                  4.	Floor Loading. Any proposed change in the use or occupancy of an existing building or portion thereof which could increase the floor loading should be investigated by a Georgia registered professional architect/engineer to determine the adequacy of the existing floor systems to support the estimated proposed increased loads. If the existing floor system is found to be inadequate, it should be modified to support the increased loads or the proposed allowable floor loading shall be reduced by the appropriate enforcement authority and the building shall be posted by the appropriate enforcement authority so as to unlawful use. 
                  5.	Compliance Alternatives. It is recognized for purposes of this chapter that all building systems interact with each other; therefore, any consideration of compliance alternatives should take into account all existing and proposed conditions to determine the acceptability of any compliance alternatives. The compliance alternatives are not all-inclusive and do not preclude consideration and approval of other alternatives by any enforcement authority. 
                  a.	Compliance alternatives for an inadequate number of exits include, but are not limited to: 
                  (1)	Provision of connecting fire-exit balconies between buildings, acceptable to the enforcement authority; 
                  (2)	Provision of alternative exits or egress facilities leading to safety outside the building or to a place of safe refuge in the building or an adjoining building as acceptable to the enforcement authority; 
                  (3)	Provision of an exterior fire escape or escapes as acceptable to the enforcement authority where the providing of enclosed interior or enclosed exterior stairs is not practical; or 
                  (4)	Installation of early fire warning and fire suppression systems. 
                  b.	Compliance alternatives for excessive travel distances to an approved exit include: 
                  (1)	Installation of an approved smoke detection system throughout the building;

                  15.60.150 - Other Considerations. 
                  A.	Building Sewer Responsibility (also called Service Sewer or House Sewers). It shall be the obligation of the owner/developer of the building or buildings being connected to the City wastewater system to determine the elevations, grades and alignment of sewer lines necessary to serve the building prior to the pouring of the building foundation or footings, and to design and construct the connecting sewer in accordance with the information thus obtained. Approval of sewer plans by the City will not assure the owner that all building elevations are capable of being served by gravity flow. 
                  B.	Underground Power Layout Approval Required. Where underground power service is approved, the City reserves the right not to approve the sewers until the sewer facilities layout has been reviewed by the power company and a letter so stating may be required. 
                  C.	Sand and Oil/Grease Interceptors (See McDonough Sewer Services Ordinance, Chapter 13.08). 
                  1.	All users involved in the preparation of food for commercial purposes shall provide oil/grease traps. The design criteria for sand and oil/grease interceptors is shown in a following subsection. 
                  2.	All users whose wastewater is generally accompanied by unusually large quantities of grit, sand or gravel shall be required to install a sand trap. All car/truck wash systems shall be required to install sand traps. 
                  D.	Permits/Encroachments. 
                  1.	All construction on State right-of-way or any streets over which the Georgia D.O.T. has jurisdiction will require a State Department of Transportation (D.O.T.) encroachment permit or equivalent D.O.T. approval. 
                  2.	All construction on railroad (R.R.) right-of-way will require a R.R. encroachment permit. 
                  3.	All construction on utility easements such as gas, power or telephone shall require the appropriate encroachment permits from these utility companies. 
                  4.	The City will assist in all of the encroachment permit applications referred to above in cooperation with the developer's engineer and applied for through the City. 
                  E.	All State or County roads shall be bored unless otherwise approved by the County. 
                  F.	No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, foundation drains, areaway drains, swimming pools, dumpster pads or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to the City wastewater system unless such connection is approved for purposes of disposal and polluted surface drainage and for which a discharge permit or approval has been issued. 
                  G.	No sewers shall be located in detention basins, ponds, or lakes. 
                  H.	For all sewers to be located on private property, at least a 20 foot wide permanent easement shall be shown on the plans and conveyed to the City. For easements off the developer's property, the City may assist in obtaining sewer easements, but the primary responsibility and cost lies with the developer. 
                  15.60.160 - Design Criteria. 
                  A.	Technical Codes. In addition to these standards, construction of all sewerage facilities shall conform to the applicable technical codes in this Chapter. 
                  B.	Sanitary sewers shall not be designed to transport storm water. 
                  C.	Facility Sizing. By negotiation with the developer, the City may require an increase in sewer sizes and sewerage facilities to accommodate either existing or future upstream or off property development with the developer(s) paying a prorata share of the costs by negotiation. In such cases, the City may elect to design and construct the increased size facilities, charging the developer(s) a negotiated prorata share and with the developers being responsible for development sewerage facilities to be compatible with the City design and construction. 
                  D.	Design Factors. 
                  1.	In determining the required capacities of sanitary sewers, the following factors to be considered should include, but are not limited to:

Pavement Replacement: Street pavement shall be replaced in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Department of Transportation, State of Georgia, Standard Specifications Construction of Roads and Bridges, 1983 Edition, and with the details shown on the Drawings and/or as specified herein. 
                  1.	Base: On Highways the base for the asphaltic concrete pavement shall be eight inches (8") of concrete, or as shown. On all other streets, driveways, etc., the base for the asphalt concrete or bituminous surface treatment pavement shall be six inches (6") of crushed stone as specified in this section. 
                  2.	Asphaltic Concrete: The crushed stone base shall be thoroughly compacted to the proper level after which it shall be primed and sealed in accordance with the aforesaid standard specification. The wearing course shall consist of 2" of Type "F" plant-mixed asphaltic concrete, conforming to the provisions of "Hot Mix Asphaltic Construction" section 400 of the aforesaid Standard Highway Specifications. 
                  3.	Bituminous Surface Treatment Pavement: The surface of the previously placed crushed stone in sewer trenches and any holes in existing pavement shall be leveled at the proper grade and thoroughly compacted by rolling. The roadway surface shall then be thoroughly cleaned, sealed and primed, after which there shall be applied a double surface bituminous penetration course, one inch (1") in thickness, conforming to the provisions of "Bituminous Surface Treatment", section 424, of the aforesaid Standard Highway Specifications. 
                  D.	Sub-Grade Preparations: Under trench paving the sub- grade shall be thoroughly compacted by approved mechanical compaction equipment to 95 percent as determined by Modified Proctor Test. Compaction tests shall be made at intervals and at locations as directed by the City. These tests shall be conducted by an approved soils testing company and shall be performed by an experienced soils technician. The costs of all tests shall be paid by the Developer. 
                  E.	Pavement Preparation: Before replacement of pavement, the pavement should be cut at least 12" back on each side of the trench or to visible overbreaks, whichever is greater, to a depth of 2" with a concrete saw. No cutback will be required on bituminous surface treatment pavement. This will insure a straight vertical edge for the patch. After making the saw cut, the pavement to be removed should be broken into small pieces and removed. The broken edge below the saw cut is left fairly rough and irregular, but is approximately a vertical plane to provide an aggregate interlock between the patch and the existing pavement. The sub-base material should be carefully placed and shaped. Water should be added to provide a damp but not wet sub-base before the concrete base is placed. The Vertical face of the existing pavement should be sprayed with a fine mist of water to moisten the vertical surface. To further improve the probability of obtaining a bond between the old pavement and the concrete base to be poured, the vertical face of the old pavement should be painted with a solution of Portland Cement and water mixed to the consistency of heavy paint. The new concrete base should then be poured before this surface dries out. The base should be placed with care, making sure it is worked back into all corners and into the rough surface of the existing pavement assuring a locking bond between the old pavement and the new base being placed. 
                  1.	Concrete Base: After the concrete base has cured, the concrete surface and vertical edges of the existing paving must be clean and dry before the tack coat is applied. The tack coat should be applied to the surface of the new concrete base and brushed into the corners and on to the vertical edges of the old pavement to provide a bond and seal out water. The asphalt surface material should be immediately placed after the surface of the tack coat has dried to the point it is sticky to the touch. 
                  2.	Asphalt Surface: The asphalt surface material should be immediately placed after the surface of the bituminous prime has cured. A short period of time is required for the prime to penetrate into the base material. 
                  F.	Replacement of Concrete Curb and Gutter, Street, Driveway and Sidewalk: Concrete curb and gutter, street, driveway and sidewalk shall be replaced with Class "A", 3,00 psi concrete of the same thickness and dimensions as was removed. 
                  15.64.380 - Grassing of Disturbed Areas. 
                  After completion of pipe laying operations, the Developer shall grass disturbed areas. 
                  A.	Grassing Along Highway Right-of-Way: Grassing along highway right-of-way shall be in accordance with Department of Transportation, State of Georgia, Standard Specifications Construction of Roads and Bridges, 1977 Edition, section 700. 
                  B.	Grassing through Established Pastures: Grassing through established pastures shall be by seeding with the same type of grass as was disturbed or, if acceptable to the City, seeding may be as recommended by the local Soil Conservation Agent. 
                  C.	Grassing of Other Areas: Grassing of other areas shall be by planting grass of a quick growing species that will also give a permanent cover. Seeding may be as recommended by the local Soil Conservation Agent. 
                  D.	Planting: Preparation of soil along highway right-of-way shall be as set out in Highway Specifications. Preparation of Soil in (B) and (C) above shall be performed by the Developer using recognized type equipment and materials for this type operation. Before planting, a fertilizer of 16:4:8 composition, or approved equal, shall be evenly applied at the rate of 20 pounds per 1,000 square feet and discoed or harrowed into the dampened soil. Seeding shall be as stated in (B) and (C) above. Seed, fertilizer, mulch and periodic watering shall be applied in adequate quantities to assure a satisfactory ground cover over the entire disturbed area of construction operations. A satisfactory stand of grass is defined as a full cover, over the seeded area, of live and growing grass with no bare spots larger than two (2) square feet. 
                  15.64.390 - Sterilizing Pipe Lines. 
                  All pipelines and all appurtenances including house service connections which have been exposed to contamination by reason of this construction shall be sterilized by the Developer before being placed in service, subject to the approval and direct supervision of the City. 
                  A.	Sterilization: Pipelines shall remain filled for a 24-hour period with a solution of water and HTH or chlorine in amounts equivalent to at least the following quantities for each 100 feet of pipe. 

                   
                  Not less than one ounce of HTH shall be used, per hundred feet, for all mains, sizes 2" and smaller, and the above quantities shall be increased if necessary to secure a chlorine residual of 50 parts per million after 24 hours. The City shall obtain a random sample of water taken from the distribution system and perform a colliform analysis before the lines will be accepted. The Developer shall furnish all HTH or liquid chlorine required for sterilization, and shall furnish all equipment and labor required for the work. 
                  B.	Flushing: Upon completion of the sterilization, all mains and piping shall be thoroughly flushed before placing in service. 
                  15.64.400 - Cleaning Up. 
                  Before the work shall be considered complete, all material not used, and rubbish of every character, must be removed from the streets and all streets, sidewalks, curbs, fences and other private or public facilities and structures disturbed must be essentially in as good condition as existed before the work was done. Any subsequent settlement of backfill or pavement over trenches shall be replaced by the Developer and the surfaces brought to grade.

                  C.	All materials, equipment, labor and other matters related to street construction shall be provided by the developer. The following is a summary of the improvements required: 
                  1.	Grading. All streets, roads, and alleys shall be graded to their full width right-of-way by the developer so that the pavements and sidewalks, when installed in the future, can be constructed on the same level plane. The preparation of the right-of-way before grading is started and the construction of cuts and fills shall be accomplished according to the specifications of the city. 
                  2.	As-built subgrade centerline profile. Three copies of an as-built subgrade centerline profile shall be submitted to the community development department.

                  4.	Roadway surfacing. After preparation of the subgrade the roadbed shall have base material and paving applied according to city specifications. 
                  (Ord. No. 04-12-06-A, § I, 12-6-2004; Ord. No. 06-05-01(A), § 61, 5-1-2006) 
                  16.16.240 - Construction requirements for residential subdivisions streets. 
                  A.	Compliance. The design and construction requirements for residential subdivisions shall comply with the minimum standards shown in Table 16.1. 
                  B.	Grading permit—Issuance and scope. After a pre-construction conference has been held, the community development department director duly notified, and all required silt and erosion control measures installed and approved, the developer may obtain a grading permit to clear and grade the areas designated for roads, rights-of-way, sewer easements, and stormwater facilities. The community development department director may also allow the clearing and grading of additional areas subject to the following criteria: 
                  1.	The topography of the site requires removal and fill operations to meet the street or grade elevations or the additional grading is necessary to protect state waters or surrounding property. 
                  2.	Any areas graded outside of the rights-of-way shall be either be covered with seed and straw within ten calendar days of land disturbance. 
                  3.	The community development department director may require additional soil and erosion control measures to be installed prior to any grading outside of the areas designated for roads, rights-of-way, sewer easements, and stormwater facilities. 
                  C.	Grading. The grading, base and pavement for residential street construction shall be as follows: 
                  1.	Elevation. All streets shall be graded to the elevations shown on the approved construction plans. 
                  2.	Buffer. A minimum of a 30-foot undisturbed buffer shall be maintained on all property lines prior to approval of the final plat. 
                  3.	Rubbish. No rubbish or other material resulting from the clearing of the roadway may be buried within the construction limits of the roadway or detention ponds. If burning is permitted, all burn pits must be located outside of the roadway construction limits. 
                  4.	Excavation. All grading operations shall be planned and executed by the contractor in such a manner as to provide suitable subgrade material in the top 12 inches of the roadway. In areas where the material in place is not suitable for subgrades, these areas shall be undercut a minimum of 12 inches and back filled with suitable material. All rock and boulders in the roadbed shall be excavated to a depth of at least 12 inches below the subgrade and the space back filled to the correct grade with suitable material. Any stones, broken rock, or boulders resulting from the grading of the roadway may not be placed in any roadway fill area except when approved by the community development department director and then under his supervision. 
                  5.	Placement of fill . Fill construction shall not begin until all clearing and grubbing of the fill area has been completed. All depressions in the ground shall be filled level with the adjacent surface using suitable material and compacted to the approximate density of the surrounding soil before placement of the fill is begun. The entire area upon which fill is to be placed shall be plowed, scarified, and finely broken up to a depth of a minimum of six inches. Before the placement of fill material is begun, all loosened soil shall be compacted the approximate density of the underlying soil. Where a depth of fill and surfacing is three feet or less, the original ground shall be compacted a minimum 12 inches deep to at least 95 percent of the maximum laboratory dry density as determined from representative samples of the material being compacted. In areas where layers of organic or other unstable materials exists, the existing ground shall be excavated, for the full width of the fill area, to an underlying stable material. The subgrade thus created shall then be compacted to the approximate density of the underlying material. All fill material shall be deposited and spread in uniform horizontal layers, not more than six inches thick, for the full width of the fill area, and these layers shall be kept uniform by the use of graders, bulldozers or other approved equipment. Each layer shall be compacted within the range of optimum moisture content necessary to achieve the compaction required. Material containing too much water shall be dried to the correct moisture content. If the material is too dry, water shall be added and uniformly mixed with the soil before it is compacted. Fills shall be compacted to at least 95 percent of the maximum dry density to within the top 12 inches of the fill. The top 12 inches of the fill shall be compacted to at least 100 percent of the maximum dry density. The entire roadbed shall be scarified and compacted with a sheep's foot or other approved rollers. While the work is in progress, contractor shall maintain the surface in a manner so that the excavation, fills, subgrade, base course, and ditches always present a smooth and even surface. 
                  6.	The contractor shall have available on the job at all times at least one motor patrol grader with adequate power to blade and maintain the roadbed. Suitable scarifiers shall also be available for use whenever necessary. 
                  D.	Development permit. After the developer has completed all of the grading pursuant to the grading permit and site has been inspected by the community development department, the community development department director may issue a development permit for the installation of streets, curbs, gutters, and utilities subject to the following requirements: 
                  1.	Final finishing of roadway . After all excavation has been completed and all fills have been placed, the entire road bed surface shall be finally shaped with a grading machine supplemented with hand work whenever required, to secure a smooth surface and uniform cross-section. Slopes of cuts and fills shall also be carefully shaped to the true section specified. When final shaping is finished, the road surface shall conform accurately to the line, grade and cross section shown of plans, and no roots, sod, grass, stones, or other unsuitable material shall remain in the top 12 inches of the finished road bed. All ditches and drains shall be opened to effectively drain the roadway. During the construction of the roadway on a day-to-day basis, the roadbed edges shall be kept lower than the center and the grading shall be done so that the surfaces of the excavated areas and fill will be kept reasonably smooth and well drained. Adequate surface ditches shall be cut at the tops of cut slopes, extending to each end of the cuts in order to carry the water from the side hill. Side ditches or gutters emptying from cuts to fill areas shall be turned outward so as to prevent erosion of the fill slopes. 
                  2.	Placement of curb and gutter. After sanitary sewer and water lines have been installed, all storm drainage in place, and the final finishing of the roadway has been approved by the community development department director, the installation of the concrete curb and gutter may begin. All concrete curb and gutter shall be in accordance with McDonough construction standards. Any curb and gutter which does not conform to a true section, texture, line and grade shall be removed and replaced as directed by the development inspector. 
                  3.	Subgrade. Before placing any pavement base the entire surface of the subgrade shall be plowed, harrowed, and mixed to a depth of at least six inches. If a subgrade stabilization material is required it shall be incorporated into the subgrade at this time. After the material has been thoroughly mixed the subgrade shall be brought into a proper line and grade and compacted to 100 percent of maximum dry density just prior to placing the base material. The centerline profile shall conform to the established elevations with an acceptable tolerance of one-half inch. The acceptance crown tolerance shall be one-half inch. 
                  4.	Base construction. The community development department director shall be notified 24 hours prior to the placing of any base material. After the inspector is satisfied all the equipment necessary for the proper construction of road base is on the project and the subgrade has been brought to the proper line, grade and crown, and compacted to the required density he may authorize the placing of the base material. After the base material has been placed and compacted to the required density the inspector will check the completed base course. All areas found to be deficient shall be marked and corrected before any asphalt pavement is placed. Areas where the crown is found to exceed that which is specified or the exposed edge of the concrete gutter is less than the minimum depth required, shall be reshaped and rolled to obtain the required cross-section. After the compacted material has been approved, cores shall be taken as directed by the development inspector to determine the thickness of the constructed base course. Areas found to be deficient in thickness shall be corrected as directed by the development inspector. A copy of all delivery tickets for the graded aggregate base material shall be furnished prior to placing any asphaltic concrete paving material. A shortage in the base material used shall require that the asphaltic concrete surface course thickness be increased. All work and materials shall be in accordance with the pertinent "Graded Aggregate Construction" sections of the "Georgia Department of Transportation Standard Specifications," latest edition. 
                  5.	Paving. After the road base has been accepted by the development inspector and upon his approval the contractor shall begin the construction of the asphaltic concrete pavement. All asphaltic concrete material and construction shall be in accordance with the "hot mix asphaltic concrete construction" sections of the "Georgia Department of Transportation Standard Specifications", latest edition. After the material has been placed and rolled to the satisfaction of the inspector, he shall check the cross section of the finished pavement. Any area found to be deficient shall be marked and a record of deficiencies made by the development inspector. 
                  6.	If, in the opinion of the community development department director, the extent of deficiencies will impair the performance of the pavement, he shall direct that an overlay of a minimum thickness of one inch be placed before the roadway is opened to traffic. A copy of the delivery tickets for the asphaltic concrete material used shall be furnished to the development inspector at the time of completion of the work. If the delivery tickets indicate a shortage in the material used from the quantity estimated the development inspector may require a minimum one-inch overlay of the streets. 
                  7.	Upon acceptance of the surface course by the community development department director, the developer shall have core tests made as directed by the city, to verify the thickness of the street base and asphalt pavement. If these indicate a deficiency in thickness of the street base and asphalt pavement an overlay shall be required when the following deficiencies occur: 
                  a.	When the number of cores deficient in thickness within the allowable one-quarter of an inch tolerance exceeds 35 percent of the total cores taken on one street. 
                  b.	When two or more consecutive tests show a deficiency of more than one-quarter of an inch allowable tolerance. When a core shows a deficiency in excess of the allowable tolerance additional cores will be taken to delineate the area of the deficient thickness. 
                  c.	Any required overlay shall extend a minimum of 150 feet beyond the outer limits of the deficient area for the full width of the street. Smooth, neat joints shall be saw cut normal to the roadway for full depth of asphalt pavement, removing the original pavement for a minimum of ten feet at each end of the overlay. The thickness of the overlay shall be determined by the depth of the deficient area and shall not be less than one inch in compacted thickness. The type of material used in the overlay shall be specified by the city. 
                  d.	After the paving has been inspected and approved, the pavement edges or behind the curb and gutter shall be back filled and compacted and the ditches and back slopes properly graded, shaped, seeded and mulched. An 80 percent stand of grass must be obtained. All swales and ditches excavated below required depth shall be back filled and compacted to 95 percent of maximum dry density.

A different existing use or an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with district development regulations, including but not limited to setback requirements, lot coverage requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots. Towers that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure. 
                  B.	Inventory of Existing or Planned Tower Sites. 
                  1.	Each applicant for a tower or antenna shall contact the owners of all existing tower sites or planned tower sites approved after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this Chapter, that are either within the jurisdiction of the governing authority or within one-quarter mile of the border thereof, and provide the planning and zoning department with an inventory of said tower sites. The inventory should include the following information: 
                  a.	The owner and/or lessee of the tower site; 
                  b.	The location, height, and design of the tower site; 
                  c.	Whether each such tower site could accommodate the tower proposed by the applicant without changing the existing or proposed structure; or 
                  d.	Whether each such tower site could accommodate the tower proposed by the applicant if either or both the existing or proposed tower was structurally or otherwise changed. Any changes shall be specified in general terms. 
                  2.	The planning and zoning department may share such information with other applicants applying for approval under this Chapter or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the governing authority; provided, however, that the planning and zoning department is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting the accuracy of said information or that such sites are available or suitable. 
                  C.	Site Plan. Applicants requesting approval shall submit a scaled site plan, showing the location and dimensions of all improvements, including information concerning topography, radio frequency coverage, tower height requirements, setbacks, access, existing and proposed utilities, parking, fencing, landscaping, and other information necessary to assess compliance with this Chapter. Any information of an engineering nature that the applicant submits, whether civil, mechanical, or electrical, shall be certified by a qualified and licensed professional engineer. 
                  D.	Aesthetics—Lighting. The following guidelines shall govern the aesthetics and lighting of all towers, and the installment of all antennas. 
                  1.	Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  2.	At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
                  3.	If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
                  4.	Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the governing authority may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. 
                  E.	Federal Requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this Chapter shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall result in enforcement action pursuant to Chapter 17.92. 
                  F.	Building Codes—Safety Standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in the City's building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the governing authority concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have sixty (60) days to bring such tower into compliance. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance with such standards appropriate action will be taken by the community development director.

                  17.90.050 - Development requirements. 
                  A.	Communication towers, tower facilities and antennas subject to regulation by this Chapter shall only be allowed in the M-1 and M-2 zoning districts. 
                  B.	Setbacks. 
                  1.	All tower facilities shall be set back from all adjoining properties zoned residential a distance equal to the height of the tower or two hundred (200) feet, whichever is greater. 
                  2.	All tower facilities shall be set back from all adjoining properties zoned nonresidential a distance equal to the height of the tower or one hundred (100) feet, whichever is greater. 
                  C.	All anchors shall be set back within the requirements of the zoning district. 
                  D.	Towers over seventy (70) feet in height shall not be located within one and one-half miles from any existing tower that is over seventy (70) feet in height. 
                  E.	Security Fencing. Towers and all facilities shall be enclosed by a wood fence or steel chain link fence with inserts for screening not less than eight feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device. 
                  F.	Landscaping. In addition to the requirements of the City landscape ordinance, the following guidelines shall govern the landscaping surrounding towers; provided: 
                  1.	The tower and related facilities shall be landscaped with a standard buffer that shall consist of a landscaped strip ten feet in width surrounding the perimeter of the compound. Buffer shall be six feet in height at time of planting. 
                  2.	Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers sited on large wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter may be a sufficient buffer. 
                  (Ord. No. 97-06-08, (part)) 
                  17.90.060 - Public hearing required. 
                  A.	General. All new tower construction and any additions to existing towers shall require a public hearing and approval by the planning and zoning commission. All such uses shall comply with sections 17.90.040 and 17.90.050 of this Chapter and all other applicable ordinances. Applicants shall apply for a public hearing through the planning department. 
                  In granting an approval, the governing authority may impose conditions to the extent the planning and zoning commission concludes such conditions are necessary to minimize any adverse effect of the proposed tower on adjoining properties. 
                  B.	Availability of Suitable Existing Towers or Other Structures for Co-location. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the governing authority that no existing or planned tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antennas (see section 17.90.020). This inventory should also include the following supplemental information: 
                  1.	No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
                  2.	Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
                  3.	Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment. 
                  4.	Applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures. 
                  5.	The fees or costs required to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed unreasonable. 
                  6.	Applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.

                  17.90.070 - Removal of abandoned antennas and towers. 
                  Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of twelve (12) months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove same within ninety (90) days of receipt of notice from the City notifying the owner of such abandonment. If such antenna or tower is not removed within said ninety (90) days, the community development director shall take appropriate action to effect the removal of the tower. If there are two or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the tower.

                  4.	The Presiding Officer shall allow the applicant to make a presentation, not to exceed 10 minutes. The Presiding Officer shall then allow those persons who appear in support of or in opposition to the Petition to speak. The Mayor and Council may adopt policies to limit this time as is appropriate for the orderly conduct of business. If it appears that the number of persons wishing to appear in support of or in opposition to the Petition are in excess of that which may reasonably be heard, the Presiding Officer may request that a spokesperson for the group(s) be chosen so that the entire presentation of the positions of those in support of or in opposition to the Petition shall not exceed twenty (20) minutes. 
                  5.	The applicant for the Zoning Amendment shall be allowed a short opportunity for rebuttal and final comment, the length of which shall not exceed ten (10) minutes. 
                  6.	After the above procedures have been completed, the Presiding Officer will indicate that the public hearing is formally closed. 
                  7.	The body may either vote upon the proposed change or may delay their vote to a subsequent meeting.

                  17.104.060 - Standards of review. 
                  A.	In ruling on any matter herein in which the exercise of discretion is required, or in ruling upon any application for Zoning Map amendment, the Administrative Official or the Legislative Body shall act in the best interest of the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the City. In doing so, they will consider the existing land use pattern and two (2) or more of the following factors as they may be relevant to the application: 
                  1.	The existing land use pattern; 
                  2.	The possible creation of an isolated district unrelated to adjacent and nearby districts; 
                  3.	The population density pattern and possible increase or overtaxing load on public facilities including, but not limited to, schools, utilities, and streets; 
                  4.	The cost of the City and other governmental entities in providing, improving, increasing, or maintaining public utilities, schools, streets, and other public safety measures; 
                  5.	The possible impact on the environment, including, but not limited to, drainage, soil erosion and sedimentation, flooding, air quality, and water quantity; 
                  6.	Whether the proposed Zoning Map amendment will be a deterrent to the value or improvement of development of adjacent property in accordance with existing regulations; 
                  7.	Whether there are substantial reasons why the property cannot be used in accordance with existing regulations; 
                  8.	The aesthetic effect of existing and future use of the property as it relates to the surrounding area; 
                  9.	The extent to which the proposed Zoning Map amendment is consistent with the Land Use Plan; 
                  10.	The possible effects of the proposed Zoning Map amendment to the character of a Zoning district, a particular piece of property, neighborhood, a particular area, or the community; 
                  11.	The relation that the proposed Zoning Map amendment bears to the purpose of the overall zoning scheme, with due consideration given to whether or not the proposed change will help carry out the purposes of these regulations; 
                  12.	Applications for a Zoning Map amendment which do not contain specific site plans carry a rebuttal presumption that such rezoning shall adversely affect the zoning scheme; 
                  13.	The consideration of the preservation of the integrity of residential neighborhoods shall be considered to carry great weight; and 
                  14.	In those instances in which property fronts a major thoroughfare and also adjoins an established residential neighborhood, the factor of preservation of the residential area shall be considered to carry great weight. 
                  B.	After hearing evidence at the Zoning Hearing, the Administrative Officer or Legislative Body shall apply the evidence of the Standards of Review in making their decision. It will not be required that the Administrative Officer or Legislative Body consider every criteria contained in the Standards of Review. It shall be the duty of the applicant to carry the burden of proof that the proposed Zoning amendment promotes the public health, safety, morality, or general welfare. 
                  C.	If the Administrative Officer or Legislative Body determine from the evidence presented that the applicant has shown that the proposed Zoning Map amendment promotes the health, safety, morals and general welfare under the Standards of Review, then the application may be granted, subject to those reasonable conditions as may be imposed by the Mayor and Council pursuant to section 17.104.070. Otherwise, such application shall be denied.

In all other instances, the Mayor and Council shall render an official decision on the petition, within sixty (60) days of the final public hearing.

                  A.

                  CHAPTER 17.108 - SIGN CODE 

                  Sections: 
                  17.108.010 - Purposes. 
                  The purposes of the ordinance are set out in the preamble hereto and as follows herein. 
                  a.	A comprehensive regulation is necessary because of the unique nature and history of the City of McDonough. In the decade preceding this ordinance there has been significant population growth in McDonough and Henry County. McDonough serves as the county seat of Henry County and Henry County is one of the fastest growing counties in the United States of America preceding the adoption date of this ordinance. Mcdonough has a unique historical town square and historic buildings that must be preserved for posterity. 
                  b.	To prevent the further deterioration of the city and to ensure that it remains an attractive residential area as well as a viable commercial area it is necessary to maintain a visually satisfying environment. A plethora of signs of a certain size and nature, no matter how tasteful, can have an undesirable effect upon traffic safety and the well-being of the entire community. The City is more likely to attract commercial enterprises and permanent residents if it improves and maintains the city's appearance. The residents will ultimately benefit from enhanced retail and commercial environments and improvements in the quality of life as a result of these regulations. City-wide regulations are necessary in view of the fact that very few areas are distinctly residential or distinctly commercial, and homes including historic homes and buildings are often found in close proximity to commercial areas; it is a rational desire of the community, and most specifically of those who live therein from day to day, to plan their physical surrounding in such a way that unsightliness is minimized. 
                  c.	Further, the city has an obligation and a right to protect the rights of adjoining landowners to adequate light and air, to promote desirable living conditions and sustain stability of neighborhoods, to protect property against blight and deprivation, and encourage the most appropriate use of land, buildings and other structures throughout the city. 
                  d.	Accordingly, in consideration of the city's rights and obligations to promote traffic safety, to preserve property values, to provide for the convenience and enjoyment of public travel, to eliminate annoyance to travelers, to attract tourists, residents and industry, to serve the public health, safety and morals, to advance the general prosperity of the community, and to serve the general welfare, the city hereby imposes the regulations contained in this Chapter. 
                  e.	The Mayor and Council find that signs provide an important medium through which individuals and entities may convey a variety of noncommercial and commercial messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as well as a traffic hazard. Such signs may also constitute an aesthetic nuisance and be a detriment to property values and the city's public welfare. The Mayor and Council intend by enacting this ordinance to: 
                  1.	Balance the rights of individuals and entities to convey their message through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs; 
                  2.	Further the objections of the city's comprehensive plan; 
                  3.	Protect the public health, safety, welfare, and aesthetics of the City; 
                  4.	Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards; 
                  5.	Maintain the historical image of the City; 
                  6.	Protect property values by minimizing the potentially adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs; 
                  7.	Promote economic development; and 
                  8.	Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations. 
                  17.108.020 - Definitions. 
                  For the purposes of this Chapter, the definitions contained in the zoning ordinance shall control. In addition, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them below, unless the context clearly indicates a contrary meaning:

                  2.	Plans for the development shall include detailed descriptions of all signs, including but not limited to, size, height, location, type, colors and materials to be used, lighting and ownership responsibility. 
                  3.	Plans for signs shall undergo the same review and approval process as is required of other aspects of the development; provided that the Planning Commission may make no modification of these regulations which would permit a sign otherwise prohibited under this article.

                  4.	Financial loss to the appellant. However, such loss is not sufficient grounds, by itself, to justify a variance. 
                  5.	Peculiar conditions or circumstances which are the result of actions of the current or former owner(s) of the property covered by the application cannot be considered as grounds to justify a variance. 
                  6.	The authority to erect and maintain additional signs as may be permitted under any such variance shall terminate upon the subdivision on of the lot upon which such variance was granted.

Application for such permit must be filed within ten (10) days of the notice of nonconformance. There shall be no charge for this permit. Failure to apply for such permit within ten (10) days shall result in waiver of the protections afforded nonconforming signs by this section and the display of such sign shall be thereafter unlawful. 
                  2.	No change shall be made in the size of any nonconforming sign, nor shall any structural changes be made in such a sign unless the sign is brought into compliance with the provisions of this Chapter. 
                  3.	Any nonconforming sign declared to be unsafe by the Community Development Director or his or her designee shall be removed or rendered safe and brought into compliance with the provisions of this Chapter.

                  b.	A nonconforming sign shall not be replaced by another nonconforming sign, except that the substitution or interchange of poster panels, painted boards or dismountable material on nonconforming signs shall be permitted. 
                  c.	Minor repairs and maintenance of nonconforming signs shall be permitted. However, no structural repairs or changes in the size or shape of this sign shall be permitted except to make the sign comply with the requirements of this Chapter.

                  Banners. All banners shall be allowed to be erected for no more than seven (7) consecutive days whereby there is no re-use of said banner after expiration of time interval if for same use.

It is hereby further declared to be the intention of the Mayor and Council that, to the greatest extent allowed by law, no section, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this Chapter is mutually dependent upon any other section, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this Chapter. 
                  c.	In the event that any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this Chapter shall, for any reason whatsoever, be declared invalid, unconstitutional or otherwise unenforceable by the valid judgement or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, it is the express intent of the Mayor and Council that such invalidity, unconstitutionality or unenforceability shall, to the greatest extent allowed by law, not render invalid, unconstitutional or otherwise unenforceable any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs or sections of the Chapter and that, to the greatest extent allowed by law, all remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs and sections of the Chapter shall remain valid, constitutional, enforceable, and of full force and effect."

                  18.06.040 - Minimum Requirements for Erosion, Sedimentation and Pollution Control Using Best Management Practices. 
                  A.	General Provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES General Permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this chapter shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of Section 18.06.040(B) and (C) of this chapter. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this chapter and the NPDES General Permit. 
                  B.	Minimum Requirements/BMPs. 
                  1.	Best management practices as set forth in Section 18.06.040(B) and (C) of this chapter shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the Director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 subsection (b). 
                  2.	A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local Issuing Authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than twenty-five (25) nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten (10) nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the Director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five (5) acres. 
                  3.	Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a Local Issuing Authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  4.	The Director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  5.	The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in Section 18.06.040(C)(15), (16) and (17), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  C.	The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  1.	Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  2.	Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  3.	Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  4.	Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  5.	The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  6.	Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  7.	Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  8.	Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  9.	To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  10.	Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  11.	Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  12.	Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  13.	Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  14.	Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in Section 18.06.040(B)(2) of this chapter; 
                  15.	Except as provided in paragraph (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25 foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the Director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the Director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the Director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.	No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.	The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  16.	There is established a 50 foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed ; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25 foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the Board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The Director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.	No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.	The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  17.	There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.	No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
                  b.	The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  c.	The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25 foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  d.	Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "Minor Buffer Impact" as defined in [EPD Rule] 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the Division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
                  D.	Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any Local Issuing Authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in Section 18.06.040(B) and (C) of this chapter. 
                  E.	The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this chapter or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 17-02-02(B) , § 1, 2-2-2017) 
                  18.06.050 - Application: Permit Process. 
                  A.	General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The Local Issuing Authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this chapter, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the Local Issuing Authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  B.	Application Requirements. 
                  1.	No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of McDonough without first obtaining a permit from the City of McDonough Community Development Department to perform such activity and providing a copy of Notice of Intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  2.	The application for a permit shall be submitted to the City of McDonough Community Development Director or an authorized representative and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in Section 18.06.050(C) of this chapter. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of Section 18.06.040(B) and (C) of this chapter will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by a minimum of eight (8) copies, or number warranted per review by the Community Development Director of scope of work, of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  3.	In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8 half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the Division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the Division, regardless of the existence of a Local Issuing Authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  4.	Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the Local Issuing Authority shall refer the application and plan to the District for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The District shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the District to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the District review shall be forwarded to the Local Issuing Authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the District, and any variances required by Section 18.06.040(C)(15), (16) and (17) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per Section 18.06.050(B)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the Local Issuing Authority and the District have entered into an agreement which allows the Local Issuing Authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the District. The Local Issuing Authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised Plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the Local Issuing Authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised Plan submittal. 
                  5.	If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this chapter section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the Local Issuing Authority may deny the permit application. 
                  6.	The Local Issuing Authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the Local Issuing Authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the Local Issuing Authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  C.	Plan Requirements. 
                  1.	Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in Section 18.06.040(B) and (C) of this chapter, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this chapter. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and State laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the Commission and in consultation with the Division and the Stakeholder Advisory Board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  2.	Data Required for Site Plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate Erosion, Sedimentation and Pollution Control Plan Review Checklist established by the Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  D.	Permits. 
                  1.	Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than forty-five (45) days after receipt by the Local Issuing Authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  2.	No permit shall be issued by the Local Issuing Authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the District and the Local Issuing Authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this chapter, any variances required by Section 18.06.040(C)(15), (16) and (17) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per Section 18.06.050(B)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the Local Issuing Authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  3.	Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this chapter, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  4.	If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  5.	The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the Local Issuing Authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this chapter. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  6.	The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
                  (Ord. No. 17-02-02(B) , § 1, 2-2-2017) 
                  18.06.060 - Inspection and Enforcement. 
                  A.	The City of McDonough Community Development Department will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the Local Issuing Authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this chapter, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this chapter. 
                  B.	The Local Issuing Authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within twelve (12) months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  C.	The City of McDonough Community Development Departments shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this chapter, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  D.	No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the Local Issuing Authority, the Commission, the District, or Division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  E.	The District or the Commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as Local Issuing Authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The District or the Commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The District or the Commission shall notify the Division and request investigation by the Division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  F.	The Division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as Local Issuing Authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the Division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a Local Issuing Authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a Local Issuing Authority.

                  18.06.070 - Penalties and Incentives. 
                  A.	Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this chapter without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the Local Issuing Authority. 
                  B.	Stop-Work Orders. 
                  1.	For the first and second violations of the provisions of this chapter, the Director or the Local Issuing Authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the Director or the Local Issuing Authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the Director or the Local Issuing Authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  2.	For a third and each subsequent violation, the Director or the Local Issuing Authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and; 
                  3.	All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  4.	When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the Local Issuing Authority or by the Director or his or her Designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the Local Issuing Authority or by the Director or his or her Designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  C.	Bond Forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this chapter and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of Section 18.06.050(B)(6). The Local Issuing Authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  D.	Monetary Penalties. 
                  1.

                  18.07.070 - Exemptions. 
                  The following specific activities are exempt from this Chapter. Exemption of these activities does not constitute an exemption for any other activity proposed on a property. 
                  1.	Activities for the purpose of building one of the following: 
                  a.	A stream crossing by a driveway, transportation route or utility line; 
                  b.	Public water supply intake or public wastewater outfall structures;

                  2.	Public sewer line easements paralleling the creek, except that all easements (permanent and construction) and land disturbance should be at least twenty-five (25) feet from the top of the bank. This includes such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including, but not limited to, manholes, vents and valve structures. This exemption shall not be construed as allowing the construction of roads, bike paths or other transportation routes in such easements, regardless of paving material, except for access for the uses specifically cited herein. 
                  3.	Within an easement of any utility existing before July 2006 or approved under the terms of this Chapter, land disturbance activities and such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including but not limited to manholes, vents and valve structures. 
                  4.	Emergency work necessary to preserve life or property. However, when emergency work is performed under this section, the person performing it shall report such work to the Community Development Director, City of McDonough, on the next business day after commencement of the work. Within ten (10) days thereafter, the person shall apply for a permit and perform such work within such time period as may be determined by the Community Development Director, City of McDonough, to be reasonably necessary to correct any impairment such emergency work may have caused to the water conveyance capacity, stability or water quality of the protection area. 
                  5.	Forestry and silviculture activities on land that is zoned for forestry, silvicultural or agricultural uses and are not incidental to other land development activity. If such activity results in land disturbance in the buffer that would otherwise be prohibited, then no other land disturbing activity other than normal forest management practices will be allowed on the entire property for three years after the end of the activities that intruded on the buffer. 
                  After July 2006, this Chapter shall apply to new subdividing and platting activities. Any land development activity within a buffer established hereunder or any imperious cover within a setback established hereunder is prohibited unless a variance is granted pursuant to [Section] 18.07.090 below. 
                  (Ord. No. 10-09-20(A), § I, 9-20-2010) 
                  18.07.080 - Buffer and Setback Requirements. 
                  All land development activity subject to this Chapter shall meet the following requirements: 
                  1.	An undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained for fifty (50) feet, measured horizontally, on both banks of the stream as measured from the point of wrested vegetation or the top of the stream bank, to be determined by the Community Development Director. 
                  2.	An additional setback shall be maintained for twenty-five (25) feet, measured horizontally, beyond the undisturbed natural vegetative buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be prohibited. Grading, filling and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback. 
                  3.	No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback.

                  18.07.090 - Variance Procedures. 
                  Variances from the above setback requirements may be granted in accordance with the following provisions: 
                  1.	No variance shall be granted to the buffer requirement by the City of McDonough. 
                  2.	Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of this Chapter, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this Chapter, and the Community Development Director, City of McDonough, finds and determines that the requirements of this Chapter prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the Community Development Director, City of McDonough, may grant a variance from the setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance requires mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel. 
                  3.	Variances will be considered only in the following cases: 
                  a.	When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the original adoption of this Chapter prevents land development unless a setback variance is granted. 
                  b.	Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the setback requirements in the Ordinance would create an extreme hardship. 
                  4.	Variances shall not be considered when, following the original adoption of this Chapter, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property. 
                  5.	At a minimum, a setback variance request shall include the following information: 
                  a.	A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey; 
                  b.	A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
                  c.	A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the setback. The exact area of the setback to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated; 
                  d.	Documentation of unusual hardship should the setback be maintained; 
                  e.	At least one alternative plan, which does not include a setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible; 
                  f.	A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion; 
                  g.	A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and, 
                  h.	Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed. 
                  6.	The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance: 
                  a.	The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
                  b.	The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries; 
                  c.	The location and extent of the proposed setback intrusion; 
                  d.	Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion; 
                  e.	The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance; and 
                  f.	Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment.

                  CHAPTER 18.08 - POST-DEVELOPMENT STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT 

                  Sections: 
                  18.08.005 - Findings. 
                  Whereas, in adopting this Chapter, the Mayor and City Council of the City of McDonough find that: 
                  A.	Land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition; 
                  B.	Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
                  C.	The impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
                  D.	These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment, by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or "credits." The Georgia Greenspace Program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits; 
                  E.	Localities in the state of Georgia are required to comply with a number of both State and Federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution; 
                  Therefore, the City of McDonough has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of post-development stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. The City has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate post-development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with post-development stormwater runoff.

                  18.08.010 - Purpose and Intent. 
                  The purpose of this Chapter is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This Chapter seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
                  A.	Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
                  B.	Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
                  C.	Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
                  D.	Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
                  E.	Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the county's greenspace protection plan; 
                  F.	Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and 
                  G.	Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up.

                  CHAPTER 18.09 - WETLAND PROTECTION 

                  Sections: 
                  18.09.010 - Findings and Purpose. 
                  A.	Wetlands within the City of McDonough, Georgia are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic wellbeing of many communities within the state of Georgia. 
                  B.	The purpose of this Chapter is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this Chapter is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, and aesthetic nature and wildlife habitat.

                  (Ord. No. 10-09-20(C), § I, 9-20-2010) 
                  18.09.030 - Wetland protection district. 
                  A.	This Chapter shall apply to all lands within wetlands located within the jurisdiction of the City of McDonough, Georgia. The generalized wetland map, adopted as part of this Title, shows the general location of wetlands and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached hereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this Chapter. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the community development department. 
                  B.	Wetland protection district boundaries. The generalized wetland map is a general reference document, and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/ landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the city and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this Chapter does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.

                  18.09.040 - Permissible Uses (Uses as of Right). 
                  The following uses shall be allowed as of right within a wetland to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging except as provided herein. 
                  1.	Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 Permit. 
                  2.	Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing. 
                  3.	The continued cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture. 
                  4.	The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and that approved agricultural Best Management Practices are followed. 
                  5.	Education, scientific research and nature trails.

                  18.09.050 - Local Development Permits. 
                  A.	No regulated activity will be allowed within the wetland protection district without written permission from the Community Development Director in the form of a Land Development Permit. Issuance of a Land Development Permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this Chapter and other applicable regulations. If the area proposed for development is located within twenty-five (25) feet of the wetland protection district boundary, as determined by the Community Development Director or authorized local government representative using the generalized wetland map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site and that a section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, a Land Development Permit will be issued only following issuance of the section 404 permit or letter of permission. 
                  B.	Prior to issuance of any development permit for activity within twenty-five (25) feet of a wetland, the applicant must include with the site plans for the proposed action documentation that the following post-development conditions will prevail at the site: 
                  1.	The rate of stormwater runoff, volume of stormwater runoff, and peak runoff from the site will not exceed pre-development levels. 
                  2.	The amount of the following pollutants carried within runoff from the site will not exceed pre-development conditions: (1) phosphorus; (2) nitrogen; (3) zinc; (4) lead. In addition, biological oxygen demand (BOD) and turbidity (TSS) shall not exceed pre-development levels. 
                  C.	Temporary Emergency Permit. A temporary emergency permit can be issued by the Community Development Director for the following reasons: 
                  1.	Maintenance or repair of lawfully located roads or structures and of facilities used in the service of the public to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telegraph, telecommunication or other services, provided that such roads, structures, or facilities are not materially changed or enlarged and written notice prior to the commencement of work has been given to the Community Development Director and provided that the work is conducted using best management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns and chemical and biological characteristics of the wetland are not impaired and that any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be minimized. 
                  2.	Temporary water level stabilization measures associated with ongoing silvicultural operations. 
                  3.	Limited ditching, tilling, dredging, excavating or filling done solely for the purpose of maintaining or repairing existing drainage systems necessary for the cultivation of agricultural crops, provided that the maintenance or repair activity does not result in the impairment, alteration or loss of wetlands not previously subject to agricultural and silvicultural use under the terms and provisions of Section 15.60.040. 
                  4.	Limited excavating and filling necessary for the repair and maintenance of piers, walkways, nature trails, observation decks, wildlife management shelters, boathouses or other similar water-related structures, provided that they are built on pilings to allow unobstructed flow of water and preserve the natural contour of the wetland. 
                  D.	Filing Fee. At the time of the application, the applicant shall pay a filing fee specified by the City. 
                  E.	In addition, the applicant may be held liable for costs incurred by the City during evaluation of the performance standards evaluation.

                  18.09.090 - Subdivision Design Options in the Wetland Protection District. 
                  A.	Any subdivision that includes Jurisdictional Wetlands shall be allowed and encouraged to use the following options: 
                  1.	Lot Size Averaging. Lot size averaging is encouraged in single-family detached subdivisions as a means to work around wetland areas. The Zoning Administrator may allow a reduction in lot size provided that the same number of lots in the same subdivision are oversized by an equal or greater area. The maximum permissible reduction shall not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the minimum required lot area. The number of lots with areas reduced shall not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the total number of lots in the subdivision. The Zoning Administrator shall require no more than a twenty-five (25) percent adjustment of rear, side and front setbacks for each affected lot. 
                  2.	Cluster Development. Clustering of residential development is encouraged. When considering subdivision approval, the Zoning Administrator will allow incorporation of wetland or other significant natural areas as open space in the subdivision plan. Such plans should designate at least (25) percent of the gross land area as open space. Density shall be calculated by subtracting from the total acreage of a parcel of land dedicated or in use for private or public roads, including all vehicular right-of-ways. The resultant acreage will then be divided by the minimum allowed lot size of the district to derive the number of lots permissible.

                  Site means the parcel of land being developed, or the portion thereof on which the development project is located. 
                  Start of construction means the date the permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements). For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a tract or parcel of land resulting in one or more new lots or building sites for the purpose, whether immediately or in the future, of sale, other transfer of ownership or land development, and includes divisions of land resulting from or made in connection with the layout or development of a new street or roadway or a change in an existing street or roadway. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a building, taking place during a ten-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of the building means (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage" regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the Code Enforcement Official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this Chapter which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this Chapter. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certificates, or other evidence of compliance required in this Chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  18.10.160 - Engineering Study Requirements for Floodplain Encroachments. 
                  An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development an streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways for which the provisions of Ordinance 18.10.220 apply. This study shall be prepared by a currently registered Professional Engineer of the state of Georgia and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the Community Development Director prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include: 
                  1.	Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development; 
                  2.	Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the Building Authority. Cross-Ordinances (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles, and future-conditions flood profiles; 
                  3.	Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-Ordinances (at least one every one hundred (100) feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development; and 
                  4.	The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all future-conditions floodplain encroachments.

                  Located within Areas of Special Flood Hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore the following provisions shall apply: 
                  1.	Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in (2) below; 
                  2.	Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge a registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and 
                  3.	If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the Community Development Director until an affirmative Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA and no-rise certifications is approved by the Community Development Director.

                  7.	Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable State requirements for resisting wind forces; 
                  8.	New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
                  9.	New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
                  10.	On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them, or contamination from them, during flooding; 
                  11.	Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure which is not compliant with the provisions of this Chapter, shall be undertaken only if the non-conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced; and 
                  12.	If the proposed development is located in multiple flood zones or multiple base flood elevation cross the proposed site, the higher or more restrictive base flood elevation or future condition elevation and development standards shall take precedence.

                  The following variance and appeals procedures shall apply to an applicant who has been denied a permit for a development activity, or to an owner or developer who has not applied for a permit because it is clear that the proposed development activity would be inconsistent with the provisions of this Chapter. A request for a variance may be submitted by an applicant who has been denied a permit by the City of McDonough or by an owner or developer who has not previously applied for a permit for the reasons stated herein above. 
                  1.	Requests for variances from the requirements of this Chapter shall be submitted to the Planning Commission. All such requests shall be heard and decided in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the Planning Commission. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
                  2.	Any person adversely affected by any decision of the Planning Commission shall have the right to appeal such decision to the City of McDonough as established by the City of McDonough in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the Office of the Community Development Director. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
                  3.	Any person aggrieved by the decision of the City of McDonough, in paragraph 2 above may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Henry County, as provided in Section 5-4-1 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated. 
                  4.	Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of Historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  5.	Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this Chapter are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  6.	Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  7.	In reviewing such requests, the City of McDonough and Planning Commission shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other Ordinances of this Chapter. 
                  8.	Conditions for variances: 
                  a.	A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  i.	A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  ii.	A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  iii.	A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance. 
                  b.	The provisions of this Chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  c.	Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  d.	The Community Development Director shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  9.	Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the Community Development Director and the Planning Commission shall deem necessary to the consideration of the request. 
                  10.	Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this Chapter, the Community Development Director and the Planning Commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as they deem necessary or appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this Chapter. 
                  11.	Variances shall not be issued after the fact.
