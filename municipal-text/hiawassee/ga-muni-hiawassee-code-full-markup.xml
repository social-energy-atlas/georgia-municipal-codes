PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Hiawassee, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances of a general and permanent nature adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Bill Sweeney, Code Attorney, and Amanda Heath, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Liz Ordiales, Mayor, Thomas Mitchell, City Attorney and Bonnie Kendrick, City Clerk for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

A supplement to this Code shall include all substantive, permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the city council during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in this Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into this Code and will, where necessary, replace pages that have become obsolete or partially obsolete; and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, this Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
                  (b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of this Code that have been repealed shall be excluded from this Code by their omission thereof from reprinted pages.

                  (2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of this Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles. 
                  (3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in this Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers. 
                  (4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," or "this section," as the case may be, or to "sections _____ to _____" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of this Code that embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into this Code). 
                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of ordinance sections inserted into this Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in this Code. 
                  Sec. 1-12. - Altering Code. 
                  It shall be unlawful for any person in the city to change or amend by additions or deletions any part or portion of this Code, or to insert or delete pages, or portions of pages, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner whatsoever which will cause the law of the city to be misrepresented thereby, unless so authorized by ordinance or resolution or other official act of the city council.

One or more deficiency determinations may be made of the amount due for one or more monthly period. 
                  (2)  The amount of the determination shall bear interest at the rate of 0.75 percent per month, or fraction thereof, from the due date of taxes. 
                  (3)  The city shall give to the licensee or wholesaler written notice of its determination regarding a deficiency. The notice may be served personally or by mail; if by mail, such service shall be addressed to the licensee at his address as it appears in the records of the city. Service by mail is complete when mailed with a certificate of service stamped thereon and a copy retained in city files or when delivered by certified mail with a receipt signed by the addressee. 
                  (4)  Except in the case of failure to make a return, every notice of a deficiency determination shall be mailed within 30 days after the tenth day of the month following the calendar month for which the amount is proposed to be determined, or within 30 days after the return is filed, whichever period should last expire. 
                  (f)  Determination if no return made. 
                  (1)  If any licensee or wholesaler fails to make a return, the city shall make an estimate of the amount of the gross receipts of the licensee, or as the case may be, of the amount of the total sales in the city which are subject to the tax. The estimate shall be made for the period or periods in respect to which the licensee failed to make the return and shall be based upon any information which is in possession of or may come into the possession of the city official. Written notice shall be given in the manner prescribed above. 
                  (2)  The amount of the determination shall bear interest at the rate of 0.75 percent per month, or fraction thereof, from the 20th day of the month following the calendar month for which the amount or any portion thereof would have been returned, until the date of payment. 
                  (g)  Any licensee or wholesaler which fails to pay the tax herein imposed or fails to pay any amount of the tax required to be collected and paid to the city within the time required shall pay a penalty of 25 percent of the tax owed in addition to interest as set forth above. 
                  (h)  The tax levied by this section may be enforced by execution in the same manner as other taxes of the city, and in addition, any failure of payment of such tax shall be grounds for revocation or refusal of the license of the delinquent taxpayer. The city council shall administer and enforce the provisions of this section for the collection of the tax herein imposed, and in so doing shall have the power to: 
                  (1)  Examine, or authorize the examination of, books, papers, records, financial reports, equipment, and other facilities of any person subject to the tax, in order to verify the accuracy of any report made, or if no report is made by the operator, to ascertain and determine the amount required to be paid; 
                  (2)  Require the filing of reports by any person or persons having possession or custody of information relating to the tax herein levied; and 
                  (3)  Allow a credit on any amount due and payable from persons who paid the tax herein levied but who were erroneously or illegally subjected thereto.

                  (b)  If the public officer's investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer shall file a complaint in rem in the municipal court of the city against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building, or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general nuisance exists and shall cause summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the interested parties in such dwelling, building, or structure. The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; identify the interested parties; state with particularity the factual basis for the action; and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. The summons shall notify the interested parties that a hearing will be held before the municipal court at a date and time certain and at a place within the county or municipality where the property is located. Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days nor more than 45 days after the filing of said complaint in the proper court. The interested parties shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for hearing. 
                  (c)  If, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state, in writing, findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order: 
                  (1)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation; and, if applicable, to secure by closing the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  (2)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property. 
                  For purposes of this section, the court shall make its determination of reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered; and, provided further, that if the unsatisfactory condition is limited solely to the presence of graffiti, the dwelling, building or structure shall not be ordered demolished or closed, but its owner may be ordered to repair the same by cleaning or removal of the graffiti. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. title 43, chapter 39A, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction. 
                  (d)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the public officer shall cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved, or to be vacated and closed, or demolished within 270 days of the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section or any equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action shall commence. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (e)  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and governing authority are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
                  (f)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
                  (g)  The lien provided for in subsection (e) shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court in Towns County and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under subsection (a). The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall, within 90 days of the completion of repairs, demolition or closure, forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the county tax commissioner. 
                  (h)  It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. § 48-4-5; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply; provided, further, that redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. The tax commissioner may initiate enforcement of liens imposed under this section at any time following receipt of the final determination of costs from the public officer. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. 
                  (i)  The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the municipality whose ordinance is being enforced. The tax commissioner may retain an amount equal to the cost of administering collection of the lien. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of administering the lien. 
                  (j)  The governing authority may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
                  (k)  Review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court of Towns County under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29.

Copies of the complaint and summons shall also be mailed by first-class mail to the property address to the attention of the occupants, if any; 
                  (3)  For interested parties whose mailing address is unknown, a notice stating the date, time, and place of the hearing shall be published in the newspaper in which the sheriffs advertisements appear in such county once a week for two consecutive weeks prior to the hearing; and 
                  (4)  A notice of lis pendens shall be filed in the office of the clerk of superior court in which the dwelling, building, structure, or property is located at the time of filing the complaint in municipal court. 
                  (b)  The public officer shall cause an affidavit of service to be filed of record in the municipal court prior to the hearing showing compliance with the service requirements of this section. Such affidavit shall constitute a prima facie showing of minimum procedural due process and shall constitute sufficient proof that service was perfected. 
                  (c)  Orders and other filings made subsequent to service of the initial complaint shall be served in the manner provided in this section on every interested party who answers the complaint or appears at the hearing. Any interested party who fails to answer or appear at the hearing shall be deemed to have waived all further notice in the proceedings.

Approval of a permit and inspection of a property shall in no manner guarantee or warrant to the owner or occupants thereof that said property has been constructed, maintained, or operated in conformance with applicable codes, laws and regulations. The city reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the city, its officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship as may now exist or hereafter be created. To the extent any federal or state law, regulation, or ordinance requires compliance as a condition precedent to the issuance of a permit, plan or design approval, inspection or other activity by the city, its officers, employees and agents, issuance of such permit, approval, or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver or estoppel of the condition precedent, and it shall remain the obligation and responsibility of the owner, his design professional(s), and contractor(s) to satisfy such legal requirements.

                  (b)  Any person who shall allow any boisterous, noisy, drunken or riotous persons to assemble or remain in their house, apartment or upon their property, after receiving oral notice from a police officer that boisterous, noisy, drunken or carousing activities have caused complaint and annoyance to the common disturbance of the neighborhood or orderly citizens, shall be guilty of an offense against the city; provided, however, no person shall be charged under this subsection unless the owner or person in possession of the premises has been afforded an opportunity to disburse the assembly or offending person from the premises. This subsection shall not preclude a police officer from arresting any individual for criminal trespass where such individual knowingly and without authority remains on private property after being notified by the owner or lawful occupant to depart.

In addition to the foregoing fines, upon conviction, the director shall discontinue the public water supply service at any premises upon which there is found to be a cross-connection, auxiliary intake, by-pass, or inter-connection, and service shall not be restored until such cross-connection, auxiliary, by-pass, or inter-connection has been discontinued.

                  ARTICLE VII. - MOUNTAIN PROTECTION STANDARDS 

                  Sec. 14-131. - Purpose. 
                  The mountains of the state are characterized by steep slopes, thin soils, and, because of the natural stresses placed on such environments, they require special protection. Land-disturbing activity on the high elevation, steep slope mountains of the state potentially threatens the public health, safety, welfare, and economic progress of the state. Such land-disturbing activity: 
                  (1)  May endanger the quality of surface water by increasing erosion and stream sedimentation; 
                  (2)  Has the potential to induce landslides; 
                  (3)  Has the potential to adversely affect groundwater due to difficulty in providing proper sewage disposal in areas of steep slope and high elevation; 
                  (4)  May damage the habitat for some species of wildlife (both plants and animal); and 
                  (5)  May detract from the mountains' scenic and natural beauty which is vital to the local economy through the recreation and tourism industries.

                  Sec. 14-132. - Applicability. 
                  The mountain protection plan or article shall apply to any protected mountain areas in the city. The term "protected mountain area" means: 
                  (1)  All land area 2,200 feet or more above mean sea level that has a percentage slope of 25 percent or greater for at least 500 feet horizontally, and shall include the crests, summits, and ridgetops which lie at elevations higher than any such area. 
                  (2)  The crests, summits, and ridgetops of mountains whose flanks meet the criteria for a protected mountain shall also be included within the protected area, even though the slopes of such crests, summits and ridgetops have slopes of less than 25 percent. 
                  (3)  On an otherwise protected mountain, areas that are at an elevation of 2,200 feet or more and have a slope of less than 25 percent, exclusive of valley floors, shall be included within the protected mountain area. For the purposes of this plan, a valley floor is defined as a depression of the earth's surface where the slopes of mountains meet at a lower limit to become nearly level, and including such associated areas at the base or toe of a mountain with a 10:1 (ten percent) slope or less.

                  Sec. 14-133. - Applicability to state agencies. 
                  These minimum planning standards and procedures shall apply to all state-owned or administered land that contains a protected mountain within its boundaries. All state agencies shall comply with these minimum standards. Failure by a state agency to comply with such standards shall be considered an indication of a governmental action which may significantly adversely affect the quality of the environment under the Environmental Policy Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-16-1 et seq.

                  Sec. 14-134. - References to existing state and local regulations. 
                  (a)  Soil erosion and sedimentation control. Proposed land-disturbing activity shall meet applicable requirements of the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975 as amended, O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq., and the soil erosion and sedimentation control ordinance codified in article III of chapter 26.

                  (a)  Public purposes and private property rights. Land development, and the commencement of other activities, if they are consistent with this mountain protection plan, will not have a negative effect on public health, safety or welfare. The application of mountain protection standards to land development and activities will not pose an undue burden on property owners nor result in the diminishing of private property rights. 
                  (b)  Conservation of unique/significant flora and fauna. 
                  (1)  The most significant areas of unique flora and fauna are located on lands owned and managed by the United States Forest Service. Rare and endangered species may be located within areas of protected mountains, although specific sites are not known. 
                  (2)  Land development and the commencement of other activities, if they are consistent with the mountain protection plan, should not have a negative impact on wildlife and plant and animal habitats; however, all of the city's protected mountains, may have areas worthy of conservation. 
                  (c)  Groundwater and surface water quality. To a significant extent, groundwaters and surface waters are protected by existing state and federal regulations. Furthermore, much of the city's groundwater and surface water is protected through ownership and management by the U.S. Forest Service, through implementation of its Land and Resource Management Plan. Development and other activities consistent with this mountain protection plan will not have an adverse impact on protected mountains. 
                  (d)  Aesthetics. The visual impact of development and activities consistent with this mountain protection plan, should not be significant. 
                  (e)  Historical and archaeological resources. Historic and archaeological resources in the city are inventoried and assessed in the comprehensive plan. An analysis of the location of such resources indicates that historic and archaeological resources are predominantly located outside of protected mountain areas. Those resources located within protected mountain areas are largely located on lands owned and managed by the U.S. Forest Service in accordance with its land resource management plan; therefore, development consistent with this mountain protection plan is not expected to have any adverse impacts on existing historic and archaeological resources. 
                  (f)  Adjacent sensitive natural areas. Sensitive natural areas include wildlife habitats, rare natural communities, significant land forms and geological features, floodplains, wetlands, and other such areas sensitive or vulnerable to physical or biological alteration. Development consistent with this mountain protection plan is not expected to have adverse effects on sensitive natural areas. 
                  (g)  Duration of impacts. No significant impacts of an adverse nature are anticipated if development conforms to the mountain protection plan. Any minimal impacts that might occur on protected mountains would be temporary.

                  Sec. 14-167. - Post-development stormwater management performance criteria. 
                  The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this article: 
                  (1)  Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
                  a.  It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; 
                  b.  Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and 
                  c.  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the mayor or appointed designee are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
                  (2)  Stream channel protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches: 
                  a.  Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer; 
                  b.  24-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event; 
                  c.  Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control. 
                  (3)  Overbank flooding protection. Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, 24-hour storm under subsection (2)b of this section is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided. This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the mayor or appointed designee for sites where the post-development downstream analysis shows that uncontrolled post-development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions. 
                  (4)  Extreme flooding protection. Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, 24 hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the mayor or appointed designee for sites where the post-development downstream analysis shows that uncontrolled post-development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions. 
                  (5)  Structural stormwater controls. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the city before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the city may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
                  (6)  Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures. The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under subsection (1) of this section. The applicant may, if approved by the city, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
                  (7)  Drainage system guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include, but are not limited to, culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catchbasins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutter, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public rights-of-way. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff from more than one parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following requirements: 
                  a.  Methods to calculate stormwater flows shall be in accordance with the stormwater design manual; 
                  b.  All culverts, pipe systems and open channel flow systems shall be sized in accordance with the stormwater management plan using the methods included in the stormwater design manual; and 
                  c.  Design and construction of stormwater conveyance facilities shall be in accordance with the criteria and specifications found in the stormwater design manual. 
                  (8)  Dam design guidelines. Any land-disturbing activity that involves a site which proposes a dam shall comply with the Georgia Safe Dams Act and Rules for Dam Safety as applicable. 
                  (9)  Minimum requirements. Notwithstanding any provision of this article to the contrary, the following are the minimum requirements for the issuance of a permit under this article: 
                  a.  Stormwater management plan.

                  ARTICLE IX. - WETLANDS PROTECTION 

                  Sec. 14-194. - Purpose. 
                  (a)  The wetlands in the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state. 
                  (b)  Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
                  (c)  The purpose of this article is to promote wetlands protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process.

                  Sec. 14-195. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Generalized wetlands map means the current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service national wetlands inventory maps for the city. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland means an area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland determination means a delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC § 1251 et seq. 
                  Regulated activity means any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. excepting those activities exempted in section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
                  Wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation.

                  (a)  The wetlands protection district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps. This map shall be referred to as the generalized wetlands map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto. 
                  (b)  The generalized wetlands map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the city and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.

                  Sec. 14-197. - Protection criteria. 
                  Requirement for local permit or permission: no regulated activity will be permitted within the wetlands protection district without written permission or a permit from the city. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary, as determined by the authorized city official using the generalized wetlands map. A U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required if the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site. The local permit or permission will not be granted until a section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued.

                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building.

                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD), as corrected in 1929, means a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced after April 1, 1993, or the effective date of the initial FIRM, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, the term "new construction" means structures for which the start of construction commenced after April 1, 1993, or the effective date of the First floodplain management ordinance adopted by the community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after April 1, 1993, or the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by the community.

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally aboveground, a manufactured home, and/or a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the start of construction of the improvement. Note: the market value of the structure should be the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. The term "substantial improvement" includes structures, which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, the term "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  Sec. 16-40. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation that results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. No. 0168, art. 1, § B, 6-7-2011) 
                  Sec. 16-41. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally-dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the planning committee or council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances. A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  (1)  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  (2)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  (3)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (i)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief, and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (j)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (k)  The administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (l)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the administrator, the planning committee or the council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  (2)  Where a term is defined in any section other than this section, it is generally the intent that such definition applies only within the section it appears, since it is positioned in the section to which it most readily refers; provided, however, that this provision shall not prevent the land use officer from interpreting that defined term as applying outside the strict context of the section in which it appears, and to that end, all definitions, regardless of location within this article, apply equally to the use of such terms throughout the article. 
                  (3)  Interpretations. In the interpretation and application of this article, all provisions shall be considered as minimum requirements. Where the literal interpretation is clear to the land use officer, it shall be construed literally. Where the section or subsection has a statement of purpose and intent, the land use officer shall consider said purpose and intent in making the interpretation. Where ambiguity exists, the land use officer shall interpret this article in favor of the least restrictive use of property. 
                  (4)  Use of figures. Figures associated with defined terms or regulatory subsections in this article are provided for illustration only and do not limit or change the meaning of the term as defined or the requirements of the regulation as written.

The grant of authority and powers delegated by the governing body is limited to the provisions herein and shall be used sparingly by the board of appeals/city planning committee. 
                  (b)  Board of appeals. A board of appeals is hereby established. The city planning committee, as established by separate city ordinance, shall serve as the board of appeals, and the planning committee shall have all those powers established by ordinance and shall exercise the authority of the board of appeals. 
                  (c)  Meetings. The board of appeals shall adopt rules of procedure as are necessary to carry out the purposes of its authority.

The land use officer shall serve as the advisor to the board, except in cases of an appeal from a decision of the land use officer. The board may adjourn any public hearing or meeting in order to obtain additional information, or to serve further notice upon such other property owners as it decides may be interested in the application or appeal; provided, however, that the board shall act on all applications within 32 days of the date the initial public hearing on the matter was scheduled. 
                  (d)  Authority to grant variances. The board of appeals is authorized to receive, consider, grant, grant with conditions, or deny applications for variances to the dimensional or other requirements of this Code, after a public hearing and after making written findings of fact that the conditions for variances specified herein have been fulfilled. In granting a variance, the board may impose such requirements and conditions with respect to the location, construction, maintenance and operation of any use or building, in addition to those expressly set forth herein, as may be deemed necessary for the protection of adjacent properties and the public interest. Decisions of the board of appeals shall be final; there shall be no appeal to the mayor and city council, but the applicant aggrieved by a decision of the board of appeals may pursue appeals to the courts of proper jurisdiction of the state as provided by law. 
                  (e)  Variance applications. A property owner or his authorized agent may initiate a request for variance by filing an application with the land use officer. The application shall be accompanied by a site plan, drawn to scale, showing the dimensions and arrangement of the proposed development. The land use officer may require other drawings or materials essential to an understanding of the proposed use and variance requested and its relationship to the surrounding properties. A fee shall accompany variance applications as established by the governing body by resolution from time to time. 
                  (f)  Conditions and criteria for granting a variance. The board of appeals, in cases where specifically authorized, may grant a variance only after consideration and adoption of findings of fact that one or more of the following conditions exist and criteria are met: 
                  (1)  There are unusual, exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applying to the property that do not apply generally to other property in the same vicinity or use district, and such conditions are not the result of the owner's or occupant's own actions. Such conditions may include topography, unique natural conditions, surroundings of the subject property, or the size or peculiar shape of the lot. 
                  (2)  As a result of such unusual circumstance or conditions, there is an unnecessary hardship or practical difficulty in complying with the provisions of this Code. 
                  (3)  The authorization of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property in the vicinity or district in which property is located, and the variance will be in harmony with the general purposes and intent of the provisions of this Code. 
                  (4)  The variance approved is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the land, building or structure. 
                  (g)  Staff investigation and report. The land use officer in consultation with the mayor and/or city attorney may make an investigation of all variance applications and may prepare a report thereon, considering applicable criteria specified herein. Said investigation, if prepared, shall be submitted to the board of appeals. Said investigation, if prepared, shall also be made available to the applicant at least three days prior to any public hearing scheduled on the matter. 
                  (h)  Appeals of administrative decisions. 
                  (1)  Any person who alleges there is an error in, or who is aggrieved by, a decision of the land use officer in the administration, enforcement, and/or interpretation of this Code may file an appeal with the city clerk stating the grounds for such appeal. The board of appeals is hereby authorized to hear and decide said appeals, after proper application, public hearing and adoption of relevant findings of fact. 
                  (2)  An appeal from a ruling of the land use officer shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action being appealed. The board may affirm, overrule or modify, in whole or in part, the rulings of the land use officer. In cases where an appeal is granted, the board shall have all necessary powers of the land use officer and may issue land use permits, or direct the issuance of land use permits not otherwise inconsistent with this Code and any other code, resolution, or ordinance adopted by the governing body. 
                  (i)  Notice and hearing. 
                  (1)  Upon the filing of any complete application with the land use officer for a variance or for appeal, a public hearing shall be scheduled and notice provided of such public hearing in accordance with this subsection. Prior to acting upon an application for variance or appeal, the board of appeals shall convene and conduct a public hearing on the application. The board of appeals shall establish its own procedures for conducting public hearings. 
                  (2)  For any application for a variance or appeal, a public notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the local jurisdiction at least 15 days, but not more than 45 days prior to the scheduled public hearing. Such notice shall state the purpose, location, time and date of the public hearing, and the nature of said application. For variance applications, the public notice shall specifically include the location of the property and the provision of the ordinance proposed to be varied. For appeals, the public notice shall specifically include the action of the land use officer that is the subject of the appeal. 
                  (3)  For all variance applications, in addition to the public notice published in a newspaper, the land use officer shall post a sign, which shall be not less than four square feet in area, in a conspicuous place on said property not less than 15 days prior to the date of the public hearing. Said sign shall contain information concerning the location of the property, the provision of the ordinance proposed to be varied, and the date, time and location of the public hearing before the board of appeals. 
                  (j)  Action on variances and appeals. The board of appeals shall make findings and render a decision in writing within 32 days after conducting the public hearing on the proposed variance or appeal.

The EPD director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer, and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for waterlines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines.

                  Sec. 26-55. - Application/permit process, generally. 
                  The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall review the general development plans and detailed plans of the local issuing authority/planning committee that affect the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall review this chapter and other ordinances which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the operator is the only party who may obtain a permit. 
                  (Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 3-1-6) 
                  Sec. 26-56. - Application requirements. 
                  (a)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority without first obtaining a permit from the land use officer to perform such activity. 
                  (b)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the land use officer and must include the applicant's erosion and sedimentation control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in this article. Soil erosion and sedimentation control plans shall conform to the provisions of this article. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by the number of copies of the applicant's soil erosion and sedimentation control plans specified by the land use officer. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to the creation of the plan or that such a visit was not required in accordance with rules and regulations established by the board of natural resources. 
                  (c)  A fee, in the amount established by the city council from time to time, shall be charged for each acre, or fraction thereof, in the project area. 
                  (d)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to the issuance of the land-disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a), half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the state environmental protection division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the state environmental protection division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (e)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. A district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of a district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by this article, and bonding, if required pursuant to this article, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. 
                  (f)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (g)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. In particular, the land use officer shall require a bond for habitual violators (defined as three or more convictions in the previous year) and may require such a bond for persons who have violated soil erosion regulations one or more times in the last three years. If the applicant does not comply with this article or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations.

No person shall commence construction of any improvements on any lot, prior to the approval of a preliminary plat if required by this section, nor prior to approval of construction plans and engineering plans for said improvements are approved as required by this article. 
                  (g)  Building and other permits. No building permit or certificate of occupancy, if required by the local government, shall be issued for a building, structure, or use, nor shall any excavation, grading, or land-disturbance applications be approved, on any parcel of land regulated by this section that has not been approved in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
                  (h)  Public streets and lands. No land dedicated as a public street or for other public purpose shall be opened, extended, or accepted as a public street or for other public land unless such improvements are constructed in accordance with the specifications of this article and said land and/or improvements are formally approved and accepted as public improvements by the mayor and city council in accordance with procedures established in this article. 
                  (i)  Appeals. Any person aggrieved by an interpretation or decision of the land use officer or other official responsible for the administration of this article may file an appeal to the board of appeals. 
                  (j)  Special review of subdivisions along state routes. No subdivision plat containing land that abuts a state route shall be approved until such plat has been submitted for review and comment by the state department of transportation, in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 32-6-151. When the city receives such a plat, it shall submit two copies of the proposed subdivision plat to the state department of transportation if such proposed subdivision includes or abuts on any part of the state highway system. The state department of transportation, within 30 days of receipt of the plat, shall recommend approval and note its recommendation on the copy to be returned to the land use officer or recommend rejection. Failure of the state department of transportation to act within this 30-day period shall constitute approval. If the plat is recommended for rejection, the reasons for rejection and requirements for approval shall be given the land use officer in writing. A recommendation for rejection shall be binding on the land use officer and the planning committee unless the planning committee, by official action recorded in its minutes, overrules the recommendation for rejection.

                  Sec. 26-92. - Exemptions from plat approval. 
                  The following types of land subdivisions, transfers, and sales are specifically exempted from the plat approval requirements of this article; provided, however, that such exemptions shall not apply to land development requirements and improvement requirements of this article: 
                  (1)  The creation and sale of cemetery plots. 
                  (2)  The sale of lots consistent with previously approved and recorded plats or deeds. 
                  (3)  The creation of leaseholds for space within a multiple-occupancy building or the division of property into leaseholds for commercial, industrial, or institutional use. 
                  (4)  The creation of leaseholds for the agricultural use of property where the use does not involve the construction of a building to be used as a residence or for other purposes not directly related to agricultural use of the land or crops or livestock raised thereon. 
                  (5)  Any division of land to heirs through a judicial estate proceeding, or any division of land pursuant to a judicial partition, or any division of land occurring from the foreclosure of a deed of trust; provided, however, that such exemption shall not require the city to issue permits if the resulting lots or parcels fail to meet any applicable regulations of the local jurisdiction concerning lot size, lot width, and other dimensional requirements. 
                  (6)  Intra-family land transfers and mortgage lots, as defined by this article. 
                  (Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-6) 
                  Sec. 26-93. - Lot combinations. 
                  An existing lot line forming the boundary between two conforming platted lots located within the same subdivision or a lot line between lots or parcels that have merged to form one building lot may be removed or eliminated through a final plat revision process which conforms to the requirements of this article. In the case no final plat applies to the subject lots or parcels, a boundary survey and plat depicting all lots involved in the lot combination shall be required to be approved by the land use officer and recorded as a final plat. Such combination plat shall be titled with the same name as that of the original subdivision, if applicable, and shall indicate thereon that the replat is for the purpose of removing the lot lines between specific lots (see graphic below). 

                  (Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-7) 
                  Sec. 26-94. - Boundary line adjustments. 
                  One or more existing lot lines forming boundaries between conforming platted lots located within the same subdivision, or one or more lot lines between abutting lots or parcels may be adjusted through a final plat revision process that requires the approval of the land use officer and recording of a plat meeting the specifications of a final plat. In the case no final plat applies to the subject lots or parcels, a boundary survey and plat of the entire lots involved in the boundary line adjustment shall be required to be approved by the land use officer and recorded. Such plat showing said boundary line adjustment shall be titled with the same name as that of the original subdivision and shall include thereon that the replat is for the purpose of adjusting the lot lines between specific lots (see graphic below). 

                  (Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-8) 
                  Sec. 26-95. - Design requirements for blocks. 
                  (a)  Block length. Intersecting streets shall be provided at such intervals so as to provide adequate cross traffic. Blocks in residential subdivisions should not exceed 1,800 feet nor be less than 600 feet in length, except where topography or other conditions justify a departure from these standards. The planning committee may require pedestrian ways and/or easements through the block be located near the center in blocks longer than 800 feet. 
                  (b)  Block width. The width of the block shall normally be sufficient to allow two tiers of lots of appropriate depth. Blocks intended for business or industrial use shall be of such width as to be considered most suitable for their respective use, including adequate space for off-street parking and deliveries (see graphic below). 

                  (Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-9) 
                  Sec. 26-96. - Design requirements for lots. 
                  (a)  Natural features and assets. In the subdividing of land, appropriate consideration must be given to all natural features, such as tree growth, watercourses, historic sites or similar conditions which, if preserved, will add attractiveness to the proposed development and safety from hazards. 
                  (b)  Access and minimum lot frontage. Each lot shall have access to a public street and a minimum of 60 feet of lot frontage on a public street; provided, however, that the local governing body may permit one or more lots to be accessed by private streets, as more fully specified in this article; provided further, that in the case of a lot accessed by a circular cul-de-sac, the minimum lot frontage may be reduced to 30 feet. 
                  (c)  Adequate buildable area required. Land subject to flooding, improper drainage or erosion, or that is unsuitable for residential or other use for topographical or other reasons, shall not be platted for residential use nor for any other use that will continue or increase the danger to health, safety, or of property destruction, unless the hazards can be and are corrected. Each lot shall contain an adequate building site not subject to flooding and outside the limits of any existing easements or building setback lines required by the local governing body (see graphic below). 

                  (d)  Lot remnants not permitted. All remnants of lots, below any required minimum lot size that may be required left over after subdividing of a larger tract, must be added to adjacent lots, rather than allowed to remain as unusable parcels. The land use officer may permit a lot remnant for a specific purpose such as a detention pond, provided that access and design is appropriate and the lot remnant is restricted to specific nonbuilding use. 
                  (e)  Service areas. Commercial and industrial lots shall be adequate to provide service areas and off-street parking suitable to the use intended. 
                  (f)  Lot area. The minimum lot area shall not be less than that established by the land use intensity district in which the subdivision is located, or any other such ordinance provisions, if applicable. 
                  (g)  Lot width. No portion of a lot shall be narrower than 60 feet, with the exception of cul-de-sac lots at the street frontage, nor shall any lot have a lot width less than that established by the land use intensity district in which the subdivision is located, if applicable. 
                  (h)  Lot depth. Lots shall have a depth of not less than 100 feet, unless circumstances make these limitations impracticable. 
                  (i)  Flag lots. 
                  (1)  Intent. Flag lots, as defined in this article, are strongly discouraged. However, subdivisions designed with one or more flag lots may be approved where conditions of hardship make standard design or frontage impossible or impractical due to the configuration of the lot to be subdivided. 
                  (2)  Denial if reasonable alternative exists. The land use officer, in the case of minor subdivisions, and the planning committee, in the case of other subdivisions, shall have due cause to deny any plat that proposes any flag lot, when a reasonable alternative to such lot pattern is available. 
                  (3)  Panhandle (flagpole) length restriction. If permitted, no flag lot shall be allowed to be platted that has a panhandle portion (i.e., a portion that does not meet the required lot width) that is more than 400 feet in length. 
                  (4)  Prohibition of abutting flag lots. If permitted, no flag lot shall abut another flag lot in any subdivision. 
                  (j)  Side lot lines. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines. 
                  (k)  Corner lots. Corner lots shall have adequate width to meet the front building setback requirements, if applicable, from all rights-of-way. 
                  (l)  Double frontage lots. Double frontage or through lots should be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from arterials or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography or orientation. Double frontage lots with frontage on a major arterial street shall have additional depth in order to allow space for screen planting along the lot line abutting a major arterial street. 
                  (m)  Mortgage lot. This provision addresses situations where a bank requires the creation of small (i.e., one-acre to five-acre) tracts of property from a larger existing parcel (usually farmland or timberland) in order to provide a mortgage or loan on a home or other principal building, rather than referring to the entire existing lot of record. 
                  (1)  In cases where a person can show the land use officer in writing that an application for loan or mortgage involving real property has been filed with a bank or lending institution, and said bank or lending institution requires, for purposes of the loan or mortgage, a description of property that encompasses less land area than the lot of record, one or two mortgage lots (see definition) may be lawfully created from the parcel of record without constituting a subdivision. Minimum lot sizes established by any land use district or other ordinance requirement of the city shall not be construed to prevent the creation of mortgage lots pursuant to this subsection, even if the resulting mortgage lot created is less than the minimum lot size required by said land use district or other ordinance requirement. The applicant shall be required, in the case of a mortgage lot, to file with the land use officer a copy of the survey plat creating the mortgage lot, and may be recorded in the records of the county superior court clerk as a mortgage lot plat of record. 
                  (2)  If created, a mortgage lot shall be no less than one acre and no larger than five acres in size. This provision shall not allow for the creation of a mortgage lot from any lot of record that is five acres or less in area. 
                  (3)  No mortgage lot shall be created unless it has a minimum 30-foot wide access easement from a road abutting the property frontage of the larger lot of record to the boundary of the mortgage lot.

                  Sec. 26-97. - Easements. 
                  Where a watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream traverses a subdivision, there shall be provided a stormwater or drainage easement of adequate width. Easements shall be provided for all drainage facilities as approved by the land use officer. Where easements are needed for utility locations, the subdivider shall provide them to the appropriate utility provider. Where easements are needed for public water and/or sanitary sewer lines, they shall be provided as determined appropriate by the land use officer. All easements required pursuant to this section shall be shown on the preliminary plat, if required, and final plat. 
                  (Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-11) 
                  Sec. 26-98. - Survey monuments for all lots required. 
                  For all subdivisions, a state-registered land surveyor shall install permanent survey monuments at all property corners and land lot lines, prior to final plat approval. Lot corners shall be marked with metal rods not less than one-half inch in diameter and 18 inches in length and driven so as to be stabilized in the ground. Permanent survey monuments shall also be installed in accordance with the most recent edition of section 180-7-.05, monument, of the rules of the state board of registration for professional engineers and land surveyors and the Georgia Plat Act, O.C.G.A. § 15-6-67. 
                  (Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-12) 
                  Sec. 26-99. - Preliminary plat. 
                  (a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to ensure compliance with the basic design concepts and improvement requirements of subdivisions and land developments through the submittal of a preliminary plat of all major subdivisions for review and approval by the planning committee. 
                  (b)  When required. All major subdivisions, as defined, shall require the submission of a preliminary plat to the land use officer for review and approval by the planning committee. Prior to the issuance of any permit for land disturbance or development, or the installation of any improvements, the planning committee must approve the preliminary plat, if required. 
                  (c)  Preliminary plat application and specifications. Preliminary plat applications shall be made in accordance with requirements shown in Table 4-1, and preliminary plats shall meet the minimum plat specifications shown in Table 4-2. 
                  (d)  Procedures. Upon receipt of a completed preliminary plat application, the land use officer shall schedule the application for the next public meeting before the planning committee and forward all pertinent materials in the application to the planning committee for review. An application for preliminary plat approval must be submitted as least 14 days before the regular meeting date of the planning committee to be considered on that agenda. The planning committee shall have 32 days from the date the public meeting is held to approve, conditionally approve, or deny the preliminary plat application. The basis of the planning committee's review of and action on a preliminary plat shall be whether the preliminary plat meets the purposes and requirements of this article, and all other ordinances that relate to the proposed development. 
                  (e)  Disposition. Approval of a preliminary plat shall be valid for a period of one year, after which time, a complete construction plans application must be submitted. If a completed application for construction plans is not submitted during that time, preliminary plat approval shall expire and be null and void. 
                  (f)  Amendments to approved preliminary plats. The land use officer is authorized to approve minor amendments to preliminary plats. Any proposed amendment to a preliminary plat that is determined by the land use officer to constitute a public interest shall be deemed a major amendment. For all amendments to preliminary plats determined to be major amendments, planning committee approval shall be required. The planning committee shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny the proposed major amendment to a preliminary plat. Procedures for considering a major amendment to a preliminary plat shall be the same as required for an initial application for preliminary plat approval. 
                  (Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-13) 
                  Sec. 26-100. - Construction plans and development permit. 
                  (a)  Application. Upon approval of a preliminary plat, or if no preliminary plat is required, the subdivider or land developer may apply for construction plan approval and approval of a development permit. In the case of a minor subdivision, or in cases where a preliminary plat is not required by this article, the subdivider or land developer may apply for approval of construction plans; provided, however, that in the case of a minor subdivision or land development, the applicant for construction plan approval should hold a pre-application conference with the land use officer to ensure that plans meet the intent and specific provisions of this article and other applicable regulations. The construction plan approval and development permitting process is administrative. Applications for construction plan approval and development permit shall be made in accordance with requirements shown in Table 4-1 and Table 4-2. No application for construction plans shall be accepted for processing, nor development permit approved by the land use officer until a preliminary plat, if required, has been approved by the planning committee and the proposed construction plans are found by the land use officer to be in substantial conformity with said approval and any conditions of such approval. 
                  (b)  Decision criteria. The only basis upon which the land use officer may deny a construction plan or development permit is the failure of the application to meet the requirements of this article or any other applicable local regulations or the failure of the construction plans and application to meet the requirements of preliminary plat approval specified by the planning committee. 
                  (c)  Certificate of approval. All copies of the construction plans shall be noted by inscription on the plan noting such approval by the land use officer. Construction plan approval shall expire and be null and void after a period of one year, unless activity toward improvements on the land has been initiated, or unless the land use officer approves an extension of time. 
                  (d)  Engineered drawings. Engineering drawings for public streets, including cros-sections and centerline profiles, and public and private water, sewer, drainage, and utility systems, certified by a professional engineer registered in the state, or, if authorized under state law, a registered land surveyor or professional landscape architect shall be required to be submitted for review and approval, and such plans must meet the requirements of this article and the specifications of the land use officer. Prior to approval and recording of a final plat, or prior to the approval of any certificate of occupancy, if required, a registered engineer for the subdivider/developer shall submit one copy of all finished, as-built plans of improvements, demonstrating that said improvements, as installed, meet the requirements of this article and certifying that the plans accurately reflect actual construction and installation. The land use officer shall maintain all as-built street and utility plans for future use by the city. 
                  (e)  Permits for construction in public right-of-way. Permits from the land use officer shall be required for construction in any public right-of-way. Permits will not be issued until such time that plans have been submitted and approved by the land use officer. 
                  (f)  Improvements to abutting land. For subdivisions and land developments that abut and access an abutting public street, the subdivider or land developer shall install curb and gutter, sidewalk, other road improvements, and, if required, a deceleration lane, according to the standards and specifications of this article and the land use officer, along all abutting public streets. When a subdivision or land development uses an unpaved public right-of-way for access, the subdivider or land developer shall improve that right-of-way to a pavement width consistent with city road design standards. Said improvements shall be from the subdivision or land development entrance to the paved city road which the land use officer determines will be the primary direction of travel for residents of the subdivision or occupants of the land development. 
                  (Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-14) 
                  Sec. 26-101. - Final plat. 
                  (a)  When required. All major subdivisions, resubdivisions, minor subdivisions, and dedications shall require final plat approval. The final plat approval process is administrative. Applications shall be made in accordance with requirements shown in Table 4-1. 
                  Table 4-1. Application Requirements 

                   
                    
                  (b)  Criteria for approval. The land use officer may grant final plat approval if the following conditions, as applicable, are met: 
                  (1)  The planning committee has previously approved a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision, if required (not required for minor subdivision). 
                  (2)  Where new improvements are involved in the subdivision, construction plans have been approved by the land use officer, all improvements have been installed and inspected by the land use officer, and subdivision improvement guarantees, as required by this article, have been submitted. 
                  (3)  The final plat meets all applicable requirements of this article. 
                  (4)  A complete final plat application has been submitted, including all supporting materials required by this article for final plats. 
                  The land use officer shall consider final plats and applications that meet the above-referenced conditions a ministerial action of approval. Denial of a final plat shall be permitted only upon specific findings that one or more of the above-referenced criteria have not been met. 
                  Table 4-2. Plat and Plan Requirements 

                   
                  ;ol0; (c)\ Approval certificate. Upon approval of the final plat, a certificate, stamped directly on the plat, shall state:

                  (2)  Owner's certificate. A certificate by the owner directly on the final plat, signed in an appropriate manner as follows: 
                  "The owner of the land shown on this plat and whose name is subscribed hereto, in person or through a duly authorized agent, certifies that this plat was made from an actual survey, and that all State, City and County taxes or other assessments now due on this land have been paid. Said owner donates and dedicates to the public for use forever the public street rights-of-way as shown on this plat.

                  Sec. 26-102. - Dedications of streets and public lands. 
                  (a)  Upon completion of public improvement construction, the subdivider or land developer shall notify the land use officer and request an inspection. The land use officer shall inspect all public improvements and shall notify the subdivider or land developer by mail of nonacceptance or preliminary acceptance. If the public improvements are not acceptable, the reason for nonacceptance shall be stated and corrective measures shall be outlined in a letter of notification. Upon notification, the subdivider or land developer shall correct all deficiencies identified in the nonacceptance letter within the time limit established by the land use officer. Once deficiencies are corrected, the subdivider or land developer shall again request inspection in writing. Acceptance of public improvements required by this article to be approved by the local governing body shall be forwarded to the city attorney and the mayor or appointed designee by the land use officer following approval. 
                  (b)  Subdivision streets, rights-of-way, and other lands to be dedicated to the public shall be accepted and dedicated by the city only upon the delivery to the mayor and city council of a required general warranty deed conveying fee simple title of such rights-of-way and lands. The warranty deed shall be accompanied by the city attorney's certificate of title and a tax transfer form addressed to the mayor and city council certifying that the grantor in such deed is vested with marketable fee simple title to the property conveyed thereby, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, and further, that the individual executing such deed has full authority to do so. Acceptance of such dedication shall be accomplished by resolution of the mayor and city council.

                  Sec. 26-103. - Subdivision improvement guarantees. 
                  In order to protect the city and prospective purchasers of and residents in a subdivision, the subdivider/developer shall provide to the city financial security to guarantee the installation of public improvements. The subdivider's or developer's financial guarantee may be any of the following: 
                  (1)  An escrow of funds with the city; 
                  (2)  An escrow with a bank or savings and loan association upon which the city can draw; 
                  (3)  An irrevocable letter of commitment or credit upon which the city can draw; 
                  (4)  A performance bond for the benefit of the city upon which the city can collect, or a certificate of deposit with assignment letter; and 
                  (5)  Any other form of guarantee approved by the mayor and city council that will satisfy the objectives of this section. The guarantee shall be in an amount to secure the full costs, as determined by the city, of constructing or installing the improvements and utilities required. 
                  (Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-17) 
                  Sec. 26-104. - Limitations on minor subdivisions. 
                  (a)  Purpose. Minor subdivisions provide certain advantages, such as a shorter application process and less public scrutiny, that tend to favor their use over the filing of major subdivision applications. Given these advantages, the prospect exists that subdividers may seek to divide a parcel via consecutive and/or contiguous minor subdivisions instead of filing for a major subdivision. It is the intent of the mayor and city council to prohibit the practice of chain subdivisions where the same landowner subdivides land and then files minor subdivision applications on common contiguous parcels, which collectively total more than four lots. It is also the intent of the mayor and city council to prohibit minor subdivisions adjacent to each other within a three-year time period, in cases where part of an original tract of land is now owned by another person or entity and was transferred or sold to another owner with the apparent intent to circumvent the major subdivision process. 
                  (b)  Common contiguous parcels shown on minor subdivision plats. Contiguous common parcels, as defined by this article, shall be referenced on all applications for minor subdivisions, and contiguous common parcels shall be considered part of any application for minor subdivision, for purposes of determining whether or not the division of land proposed is a major subdivision or a minor subdivision. Common contiguous parcels shall not be counted as lots in the case of a minor subdivision. 
                  (c)  Limitations. Land within a minor subdivision, including all contiguous parcels owned by the subdivider, shall not be further divided for a period of three years unless a preliminary plat application is filed and approved as a major subdivision pursuant to the requirements of this article. If property proposed to be subdivided was part of an original tract, and if the property proposed to be subdivided abuts land that has been divided as a minor subdivision in the last three years, then minor subdivision of said property shall be prohibited. This provision shall not be construed to prohibit the approval of two contiguous minor subdivisions under separate ownership; however, this provision is intended to be construed so that one property owner does not develop a minor subdivision on part of an original tract and transfer or sell another part of the original tract for the purposes of minor subdivision within a three-year period. It is the intent that land abutting a minor subdivision that was owned by the subdivider of the abutting minor subdivision shall not be subdivided as a minor subdivision for a period of three years, regardless of ownership. 
                  (Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-18) 
                  Sec. 26-105. - Standards for configuring new streets. 
                  (a)  Purpose and intent. The entire community enjoys the benefits of an interconnected network of streets and roads. It is the intention of the locality that new street alignments in new developments reflect the traditional style exhibited throughout older, established neighborhoods. Interconnected streets afford easier, safer access for emergency vehicles, school buses, and sanitation trucks while distributing traffic more evenly and avoiding excess traffic on certain central residential streets. Street patterns that result in isolated pockets of development with relatively little interconnectivity are strongly discouraged. Wherever cul-de-sacs or hammerhead turnarounds are unavoidable (typically for topographic reasons), they must always be provided with bicycle or pedestrian linkages to other nearby streets or to a neighborhood trail system. Wherever possible, cul-de-sacs should be designed to include a central island preserving existing greenery or, alternatively, planted with approved trees, shrubs, and plants. 
                  (b)  Street alignment, intersections and jogs. Streets shall be aligned to join with planned or existing streets. Under normal conditions, streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles (90 degrees), but in no case shall such a street intersection be less than 75 degrees. Where street offsets or jogs cannot be avoided, offset "T" intersections shall be separated by a minimum centerline offset of 150 feet in urban areas and 300 feet in rural areas (see graphic below). 

                  (c)  Continuation of existing streets and connections. Existing streets and their rights-of-way, shall be continued at the same or greater width, but in no case less than the required width. The planning committee may require that a major subdivision provide one or more future connections to adjoining subdivisions or unsubdivided tracts. 
                  (d)  Street plans for future phases of the tract. Where the plat or site plan proposed to be subdivided or developed includes only part of the tract owned or intended for subdivision or development by the subdivider or land developer, a tentative plan of a future street system for the portion not slated for immediate subdivision consideration may be required by the land use officer and, if required, shall be prepared and submitted by the subdivider or land developer. 
                  (e)  Dead-end streets and cul-de-sacs. Streets that dead-end shall terminate in a cul-de-sac. The maximum length of such streets shall be 600 feet. Streets that are planned to continue at some future date shall provide a temporary cul-de-sac as required by the land use officer. 
                  (f)  Marginal access streets. Whenever a major subdivision is proposed abutting the right-of-way of a U.S. or state highway, a marginal access street approximately parallel and adjacent to such right-of-way may be required by the planning committee at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of land between such marginal access street and highway right-of-way. The planning committee may also require a 20-foot no-access easement and planting strip along the major arterial street to ensure that lots fronting on said street do not have access thereto (see graphic below). 

                  (g)  Alleys and service access. Alleys may be provided. If they are provided, they must be paved. Dead-end alleys shall be avoided were possible; but if unavoidable, they shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities. Service access shall be provided to commercial and industrial developments for off-street loading, unloading, and parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed. 
                  (Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-19) 
                  Sec. 26-106. - Requirements for streets. 
                  (a)  Bridges. Bridges on public rights-of-way shall meet current American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials standards. 
                  (b)  Grading and stabilization of street rights-of-ways. When a new public street is proposed, all trees, brush, stumps, rocks, or other debris shall be cleared from the street right-of-way, except in cases where trees are required to be preserved by the land use officer. All streets shall be graded to lines, grades and cross-sections approved on plans. All unsurfaced, disturbed portions of street rights-of-way shall be stabilized by seeding, fertilizing, and mulching or by another equally effective method. 
                  (c)  Radius at street intersections. The right-of-way radius at street intersections shall be a minimum of 15 feet, with larger radii for streets serving nonresidential development, as approved by the land use officer. The minimum pavement (curb) radius at street intersections shall be 25 feet. 
                  (d)  Street grades. No street grade shall be less than one percent. No street grade for an arterial or collector street shall exceed eight percent. No other local street grade shall exceed 12 percent, unless the land use officer finds that due to topographic conditions, a steeper grade is necessary, in which case the street grade shall not exceed 15 percent. Grades between 12 percent and 15 percent shall not exceed a length of 150 feet. 
                  (e)  Minimum street right-of-way and pavement widths. Street right-of-way and pavement widths shall, at minimum, meet the following: 

                   



                  (f)  Street horizontal alignment and reverse curves. Street horizontal alignments and reverse curves shall, at minimum, meet the following: 

                   
                  (Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-20) 
                  Sec. 26-107. - Curbcuts and access specifications. 
                  (a)  Entrance improvement specifications. Roadway entrances and improvements, including necessary acceleration and/or deceleration lanes and right/left turn lanes, shall be designed, installed, and maintained as approved by the state department of transportation, as applicable, or the land use officer, in accordance with applicable state or city specifications. All entrances or exits of any street or driveway, public or private, from or to any state highway shall be approved by the state department of transportation and the land use officer prior to the construction of such entrances or exits and prior to the issuance of any land use permit or building permit for any improvement to be served by such entrances or exits. All entrances or exits of any street or driveway, public or private, from or to any city street shall be approved by the land use officer prior to the construction of such entrances or exits and prior to the issuance of any land use permit or building permit for any improvement to be served by such entrances or exits. 
                  (b)  Curbcut specifications. No curbcut or access driveway shall be permitted to be located closer than 100 feet to the nearest existing or proposed right-of-way of an intersecting roadway. Curbcuts or access driveways shall be no narrower than 24 feet from back-of-curb to back-of-curb. Strict adherence to these requirements may not be practical in all instances as determined by the land use officer. The land use officer may limit the maximum width of a curbcut and/or the number of curbcuts to a parcel as necessary when it is deemed to be of benefit to the safety and welfare of the public. The following factors may be considered during the review and approval of a specific location of an entrance: the location of existing or planned median breaks; separation requirements between the entrance and major intersections; separation requirements between other entrances; the need to provide shared access with other sites; the need to align with previously approved or constructed access points on the opposite side of the street; and the minimum number of entrances needed to move traffic onto and off the site safely and efficiently. 
                  (c)  Access along and near divided highways. Where a divided highway exists or is planned, the following access standards shall be met: 

                   
                  (d)  Interparcel connections. New development that contains or is intended to contain more than one building or use on-site shall provide connections so that automobile trips between and among such buildings or uses can be accomplished without using the highway or major street. Where possible and practical, new developments and substantial improvements to existing developments shall provide for pedestrian and automobile access connections between adjacent properties under different ownership when the uses of the properties are of such compatibility that patrons may frequent both buildings or uses in the same vehicle trip. 
                  (Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-21) 
                  Sec. 26-108. - Street lighting. 
                  (a)  Street lights may be provided in accordance with city specifications by the developers of a subdivision prior to the approval of a final plat. Fixtures and standards/poles installed or used shall be approved by the city and by the utility company that will be responsible for the maintenance of the facilities. The fixtures shall be mounted no more than 30 feet above the ground and shall have appropriate arm length or power to place light over the street. Post top luminaries may be permitted when approved by the land use officer. Fixtures shall be located no more than 500 feet apart, unless approved by the land use officer and, when provided, at least one light shall be located at each public or private street intersection within the subdivision or land development. 
                  (b)  The developer shall pay all costs for poles, fixtures and any other related items or materials necessary for the installation of street lights, as well as arrange an agreement with the utility company for complete maintenance of all installations. The city may assume the responsibility and make the monthly payments to the power company for electrical energy for each street light only after these requirements have been accomplished and improvements accepted by the local governing body. Maintenance and operation costs of streetlights will be assumed by the city no earlier than two years after lights have been installed. 
                  (Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-22) 
                  Sec. 26-109. - Street signs. 
                  (a)  Signs for street names, directions of travel, traffic control, and hazards shall be provided as directed by the land use officer. Street signs on exterior/boundary streets shall be installed by the city with the developer paying a proportionate share determined by the city. Street signs for interior streets of a subdivision or land development shall be installed at the subdivider or developer's expense by the subdivider or developer, subject to the approval of the land use officer. 
                  (b)  Unless otherwise provided in standards and specifications adopted by the city, street signs shall meet the following specifications: Signs shall be constructed of aluminum sheets with reflective backgrounds. Information on the street name signs shall be readable from both sides of the sign. Signs shall be installed on a steel post. The vertical distance from the road elevation to the bottom of the sign face shall be seven feet with a minimum burial depth of three feet. 
                  (Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-23) 
                  Sec. 26-110. - Curbs and gutters. 
                  (a)  Curbs and gutters shall be installed, if required by the land use officer, in accordance with standards and specifications of the city. Subdivisions consisting totally of lots intended for single-family residential use containing a minimum of two acres shall not require curbs and gutters; provided, however, that curbs are required for all roads when sidewalks are required by this article. All commercial and industrial subdivisions and land developments must have curbs and gutters, regardless of the size of the lots. When property fronting on an existing city street is subdivided or developed, and the subdivision or land development uses said existing street for access, then curb and gutter shall be required along said street along the entire property frontage of said street. 
                  (b)  Curbs shall be concrete which shall be class A 3,000-psi strength at 28 days. The typical curb minimum section shall be six inches by 24 inches by 12 inches (see graphic below). 

                  (c)  All streets and roads not required to include curbs and gutters shall be graded, paved, and drained to meet all construction and drainage standards for ditches, slopes, and grassing according to specifications established by the city. 
                  (Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-24) 
                  Sec. 26-111. - Sidewalks. 
                  (a)  When required. Sidewalks shall be provided in accordance with this article, unless the land use officer determines that no public need exists for sidewalks in a certain location. Sidewalks shall be required when land developments and subdivisions are located within one-half mile of a public school, hospital, city park, city square or city recreational facility. Sidewalks are required to be installed along one side of the street internal to a major subdivision, except in cases where the median lot size of the major subdivision is two acres or more. 
                  (b)  Location. Sidewalks shall be included within the dedicated nonpavement right-of-way of roads and shall parallel the street pavement as much as possible; provided, however, the land use officer may permit sidewalks to be designed and constructed so that they meander around permanent obstructions or deviate from a linear pattern for design purposes. 
                  (c)  Specifications. Sidewalks shall be a minimum of four feet wide. A median strip of grassed or landscaped areas at least two feet wide shall separate all sidewalks from adjacent curbs in residential areas. All sidewalks shall be construction in accordance with the state department of transportation specifications for enhancement grants that include sidewalk construction. 
                  (Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-25) 
                  Sec. 26-112. - Private streets. 
                  (a)  Private streets permitted. Private streets may, upon application, be permitted by the mayor and city council within major subdivisions, subject to the requirements of this section. Applications for approval of private streets shall be considered by the mayor and city council at the time of preliminary plat approval by the planning committee. Following a recommendation by the planning committee to authorize private streets in a major subdivision, the mayor and city council shall consider the application and may impose conditions on the approval of private streets to ensure various public purposes and to mitigate potential problems with private streets. No final plat involving a private street shall be approved unless said final plat conforms to the requirements of this section. 
                  (b)  Construction plans required. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to construct a new private street or alter an existing private street or to cause the same to be done without first obtaining approval of construction plans from the land use officer and a development permit issued in accordance with the requirements of this article. 
                  (c)  Standards. All private streets shall be constructed to all standards for public streets as required by this article for public streets, applicable construction specifications of the city, and as approved by the land use officer. 
                  (d)  Street names and signs. Private streets shall be named, subject to the approval of the land use officer and county 911 center. The subdivider of land involving a private street shall install street signs with content containing the street name and the designation "private." The sign signifying the private street may be required by the city to be a different color than that of street signs provided for public streets, in order to distinguish maintenance responsibilities in the field. 
                  (e)  Easements. Easements for private streets shall be designated on final plats as general purpose public access and utility easements, along with the name of said private street. Said easement shall, at minimum, be of the same width as that required for the right-of-way of a public street by the major thoroughfare plan and the city for the type of public street (local, collector, etc.) most closely resembling the proposed private street. Easements for private streets shall not be included in any calculation of minimum lot size or density limitations established by local land use regulations. In the cases of private streets, the general purpose public access and utility easement for the private street shall either: 
                  (1)  Be shown in a manner on the final plat such that each lot fronting the private street extends to the centerline of the private street. No lot shall be permitted to be divided by the general purpose public access and utility easement required and established for a private street; or 
                  (2)  Shall be drawn as its own discrete parcel to be dedicated to a private homeowners' association (i.e., not shown to be a part of any lot). 
                  (f)  Maintenance. The city shall not maintain, repair, resurface, rebuild, or otherwise improve streets, signs, drainage improvements or any other appurtenances within general purpose public access and utility easements established for private streets. A private maintenance covenant recorded with the clerk of the superior court of the county shall be required for any private street and other improvements within general purpose public access and utility easements established for private streets. The covenant shall set out the distribution of expenses, remedies for noncompliance with the terms of the agreement, rights to the use of easements, and other pertinent considerations. The covenant shall specifically include the following terms: 
                  (1)  The covenant shall establish minimum annual assessments in an amount adequate to defray costs of ordinary maintenance and procedures for approval of additional needed assessments. The covenant shall also specify that the funds from such assessments will be held by a homeowners or property owners association in cases of a subdivision of seven or more lots fronting on a private street. 
                  (2)  The covenant shall include a periodic maintenance schedule. 
                  (3)  The covenant for maintenance shall be enforceable by any property owner served by the private street. 
                  (4)  The covenant shall establish a formula for assessing maintenance and repair costs equitably to property owners served by the private street. 
                  (5)  The covenant shall run with the land. 
                  (6)  The mayor and city council may, at its discretion, as a condition of approving private streets, require a performance bond and/or maintenance bond be submitted by the subdivider and held by a homeowners or property owners association, or the council may require that the subdivider pay an amount of money as recommended by the land use officer into an escrow account or other suitable account for the maintenance and repair of private streets and stormwater management improvements, to be drawn from by the homeowners or property owners association as maintenance and repair needs may arise. 
                  (g)  Specifications for final plats involving private streets. The land use officer shall not approve for recording any final plat involving a private street unless and until it shall contain the following on the face of the plat: 
                  (1)  Deed book and page reference to the recorded covenant required by this section: 
                  "Public Notice: The City of Hiawassee has no responsibility to build, improve, maintain, or otherwise service the private streets, drainage improvements, and other appurtenances contained within the general public purpose access and utility easement or easements for private streets shown on this plat." 
                  (2)  Grant of easement. 
                  "The general purpose public access and utility easement shown on this plat for private street is hereby granted and said grant of rights shall be liberally construed to provide all necessary authority to the city, and to public or private utility companies serving the subdivision, for the installation and maintenance of utilities, including, but not limited to, electric lines, gas lines, telephone lines, waterlines, sewer lines, cable television lines, and fiber optic cables, together with the right to trim interfering trees and brush, together with a perpetual right of ingress and egress for installation, maintenance, and replacement of such lines. 
                  ___________ 
                  Signature of Property Owner;" and 
                  (3)  The following certificate of dedication shall be required, unless the mayor and city council waives the dedication requirement: 
                  "Certificate of Dedication. All water and sewer lines installed within the general purpose public access and utility easement shown on this plat for private street shall be dedicated to the City of Hiawassee by Council Acceptance and Approval at Public Meeting and as recorded on the Public Record. 
                  ___________ 
                  Signature of Property Owner." 
                  (h)  Requirement for purchaser's acknowledgement of private responsibilities. Prior to the sale or as a condition of the closing of a real estate transaction involving any lot served by a private street in the city, the owner, subdivider or seller of said lot shall execute a notarized purchaser's acknowledgement of private street construction and drainage maintenance responsibilities as set forth below. A copy of the purchaser's acknowledgement shall be retained by the purchaser and shall be required to be submitted as a condition of a building permit for a principal building on said lot: 
                  "Purchaser's Acknowledgement of Private Street and Drainage Maintenance Responsibility: 
                  (I)/(We) have read the Declaration of covenant which pertains to the lot that is the subject of this real estate transaction ___________ (insert address or attach legal description). (I)/(We) understand that the Declaration of covenant applies to the lot that (I am)/(we are) purchasing and requires (me)/(us) to provide a specified percentage or amount of the financing for the construction and maintenance of any private street and drainage facilities serving the lot which (I am)/(we are) purchasing, and that owners of other lots in this plat may sue for and recover those costs which this covenant requires (me)/(us) to pay, plus their damages resulting from (my)/(our) refusal to contribute, plus reasonable attorneys' fees. (I)/(We) further understand that the City has no obligation to assist with the maintenance and improvement of the private street, drainage facilities, and other appurtenances within the general purpose public access and utility easement for the private road serving the lot in question. (I)/(We) understand that a copy of this purchaser's acknowledgement shall be required as a condition of the issuance of a building permit for a principal building on the lot (I am)/(we are) purchasing. 
                  ___________ 
                  Purchaser 
                  ___________ 
                  Purchaser" 
                  (Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-26) 
                  Sec. 26-113. - Drainage and stormwater management. 
                  (a)  General requirements. An adequate drainage system, separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system and including any necessary ditches, pipes, culverts, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges, etc., shall be provided for the proper drainage of all surface water for all subdivisions and land developments within the city. Sizing and location of all drainage structures shall be the responsibility of a registered professional engineer or land surveyor. The city may require the use of on-site control methods such as retention or detention to mitigate the stormwater and drainage impacts of the proposed subdivisions and land developments. The planning committee shall not approve any preliminary plat of subdivision that does not make adequate provision for stormwater and floodwater runoff channels or basins as determined by the land use officer. No building permit shall be issued for any building within a subdivision or development permit issued for the development of land, if there is not present throughout the subdivision or to the land development an adequate system of drainage and stormwater management. 
                  (b)  Method of design and capacity. Storm sewers, where required, shall be designed by the rational method, or other methods as approved by the city, and a copy of design computations shall be submitted along with required plans. Drainage improvements shall accommodate potential runoff from the entire upstream drainage area within the site and shall be designed to prevent increases in downstream flooding. Capacity for a ten-year storm or rain shall be provided for all street drainage structures such as catchbasins, inlets, cross-drains, etc. Capacity for a 100-year frequency storm event shall be provided for all main drainage structures such as retention basins, principal storm sewers, and all types of flood protection works. 
                  (c)  Location. Drainage facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way where feasible, and shall be constructed in accordance with standards and specifications of the city. Catchbasins shall be located at low points of streets. Where topography or other conditions are such as to make impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within road rights-of-way, perpetual, unobstructed easements at least 15 feet in width for drainage facilities shall be provided across property outside the road right-of-way and with satisfactory access to the road. 
                  (d)  Discharge. Drainage shall be designed so as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from each lot or land development site to adjacent lots, land development sites, or vacant properties. Stormwater shall not be discharged directly to perennial streams. It shall be directed toward natural drainages. If water must be discharged to a stream, the water quality flowing into the stream must meet or exceed the water quality in the receiving waters. The water quantity flowing into the stream must be evaluated to ensure the stream channel can accommodate the increased flows and not disrupt or degrade the ecology of the water body. 
                  (e)  Grading and site drainage. Lots or land development sites shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away from all buildings, and drainage for individual lots or land development sites shall be coordinated with the general storm drainage pattern for the area. Buildings and parking lots shall be appropriately drained so as to prevent damage to abutting properties or public streets. All disturbed or graded ground areas of a building site not used for buildings or open storage areas shall be appropriately stabilized and grassed or covered with plants or landscaping materials. 
                  (f)  Cross-drainpipes. Where a watercourse separates the buildable area of a lot from the street by which it has access, provisions shall be made for installation of a culvert or other structure, the design of which shall be approved by the city. Cross-drains shall be provided to accommodate all natural waterflow, and shall be of sufficient length to permit full-width roadways and the required slopes. Cross-drainpipes shall have head walls of an approved type on inlet and outlet ends of the pipe. Pipe installed within the right-of-way shall be reinforced concrete pipe. All storm drainpipes shall be a minimum of 18 inches in diameter. Storm sewer slopes shall be equal to or greater than one percent. 
                  (g)  Drop inlets. Drop inlets shall be generally three-foot by three-foot boxes with two-foot by three-foot grates unless otherwise specified by the city. 
                  (h)  Easements. Where an irrigation ditch or channel, natural creek, stream or other drainageway crosses a subdivision or land development, the subdivider or developer shall provide an easement sufficient for drainage and maintenance. Easements shall be provided for all drainage facilities as approved by the city. When a subdivision or land development is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel, or intermittent stream, a stormwater or drainage easement of at least 20 feet shall be provided.

                  Sec. 26-114. - Water. 
                  (a)  Generally. All habitable buildings and buildable lots shall be connected to a water system capable of providing water for health and emergency purposes, including adequate fire protection. No permit shall be issued for any building within a subdivision or for the development of land, if there is not present throughout the subdivision or to the land development an adequate water supply. 
                  (b)  Water main requirements. When a public water main is accessible, the developer shall install adequate water facilities, including fire hydrants, according to specifications of the city. All water mains shall normally be at least six inches in diameter except that pipe of lesser size may be used if properly looped and adequate water pressure is maintained in accordance with standards established by the Southeastern Fire Underwriters Association. Pipe of less than four inches shall not be used except in unusual cases. Waterlines shall be installed at least 30 inches below grade. Water mains within subdivisions and land developments must be provided with connections to each lot in the subdivision and each land development, except as otherwise specifically provided. 
                  (c)  Wells. If a county and/or municipal water supply is not available to the subdivision or land development at the time of constructing improvements for a subdivision or land development, then the subdivider or developer shall provide an adequate alternative water source and an adequate water storage facility. In subdivisions or land developments with a residential density of one unit per acre or less and when a public water system is not available as determined by the city, individual wells may be used in a manner so that an adequate supply of potable water will be available to every lot in the subdivision or to the land development. When individual wells are proposed to be used for water supply, water samples shall be submitted to the county health department for its approval, and individual wells shall be approved by the county health department. Approvals shall be submitted to the land use officer prior to final subdivision plat approval. 
                  (d)  Community water system. If the municipal water supply is not available to the subdivision or land development at the time of constructing improvements for a subdivision or land development, then the subdivider or developer shall provide an adequate alternative water source and an adequate water storage facility. Any community water system, if permitted, shall provide a minimum flow of 400 gallons per day per each lot platted, whether or not each lot is to be immediately developed; shall be sanitary; and shall have a minimum pressure of 30 pounds per square inch at each lot in the subdivision or each land development to be served. For all common non-public water supply systems, acceptable management, maintenance, and distribution policies and procedures shall be established. These policies and procedures shall be required to guarantee the provision of adequate supplies to each perspective lot owner on a continuing, ongoing basis, and to provide acceptable means for repairs and unforeseen events. The community water system plan shall be approved by the county health department and a letter of approval from the state department of natural resources shall accompany the final plat or land development application. Notwithstanding, any provision of this article to the contrary, the community water system shall meet the requirements of all applicable state or federal law, rule or regulation. 
                  (e)  Fire hydrants. Fire hydrants shall be required for all nonresidential land developments and all subdivisions except those permitted to be served by individual on-site wells. Fire hydrants with appropriate water pressure at appropriate intervals throughout the subdivision or land development shall be provided by the subdivider or land developer as required by the city and the county fire department. Fire hydrants shall be located no more than 1,000 feet apart and within 500 feet of any principal dwelling. Hydrants, fittings, valves and fire department connections shall be approved by the fire department. Fire department connections shall be not less than 18 inches or more than 36 inches above the level of the adjoining ground or paving. The thread of such connections shall be uniform with that used by the fire department. To eliminate future street openings, all underground utilities for fire hydrants, together with the fire hydrants themselves, and all other supply improvements shall be installed before any final paving of a street within the right-of-way shared by such underground utilities. 
                  (Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-28) 
                  Sec. 26-115. - Sewer. 
                  (a)  Generally. All habitable buildings and buildable lots within the city shall be served by an approved means of wastewater collection and treatment. No permit shall be issued for any building within a subdivision or for the development of land, if there is not present throughout the subdivision or to the land development an adequate system of wastewater collection and treatment. 
                  (b)  Connection to public sewerage system. When a public sanitary sewerage system is reasonably accessible, as determined by the city, the subdivider or land developer shall connect with it and provide sewers accessible to each lot in the subdivision or to each land development. If a public sanitary sewer is reasonably accessible, it shall be unlawful for any person to maintain upon any such property an individual sewage disposal system. When a public sanitary sewerage system is not immediately accessible but is anticipated by the city to be available within a period of three years, the applicant shall install sanitary sewer lines, laterals, and mains from the street curb to a point in the subdivision or land development boundary so that a future connection with the public sewer main can be made. The land use officer may condition the approval of a subdivision or land development on the agreement to connect to the public sewerage system upon its availability. Sanitary sewers shall be located within street or alley rights-of-way unless topography dictates otherwise. No public sewer shall be less than eight inches in diameter. Manholes shall be installed in sanitary sewers with a maximum distance between two manholes of 400 feet, unless otherwise specified by standards of the city. Sanitary sewer slopes shall be equal to or greater than 0.7 percent for eight-inch lines. All sewer lines shall be designed with slopes to obtain a minimum velocity of two feet per second. Minimum 20-foot-wide easements shall be provided for all sanitary sewer lines. 
                  (c)  Alternative provision. If sanitary sewer is not available at the time of the development of the subdivision or land development, and if sanitary sewer is not anticipated to be available within a period of three years to serve the subdivision or land development in question, then on-site septic tanks, an oxidation pond, or another approved method of treatment of sanitary sewerage shall be installed by and at the expense of the subdivider or land developer in conformity with the requirements of the county health department and according to specifications adopted by the city. 
                  (d)  Septic tanks. Where individual on-site wastewater disposal systems are allowed and proposed, individual lot sizes and shapes must exhibit appropriate regard for the peculiar health, drainage, and maintenance characteristics on the site. A minimum setback of 100 feet shall be observed between any well and any septic tank on the same lot. Additionally, detailed soil tests may be required in order to verify the ability of the lots to safely contain and dispose of septic system effluent. All septic tanks and on-site wastewater disposal systems are subject to the approval of the county health department.

                  Sec. 26-116. - Utilities. 
                  All utility facilities, including, but not limited to, gas, electric power, telephone, and cable television, shall be located underground throughout the subdivision or land development. Whenever existing utility facilities (other than major distribution lines) are located aboveground, except when existing with public roads rights-of-way, they shall be removed and placed underground. Easements centered on rear lot lines shall be provided for utilities, private and public, and such easements shall be at least ten feet wide. When topographical or other conditions are such as to make impractical the inclusion of utilities along the rear lot lines of a subdivision, lot, or land development site, perpetual unobstructed easements at least ten feet in width shall be provided alongside lot lines with satisfactory access.

                  Sec. 26-117. - Oversizing of improvements and utilities. 
                  The subdivider or land developer shall construct such oversized improvements and utilities that the city determines are necessary, provided that the subdivider or land developer shall not be obligated for the additional cost of improvements and utilities that are not uniquely required for that development, and provided the subdivider agrees to a proposal by the city to share in the cost arrangements for oversizing improvements and utilities. A formula may be developed by the city to provide for a sharing of the cost of other improvements needed to serve the subdivision or land development when certain of the improvements are necessary to serve future subdivisions or developments in the vicinity. 
                  (Ord. of 8-8-2017, § 4-1-31) 
                  Sec. 26-118. - Administration. 
                  (a)  Fees. The fees for various applications required by this article shall be as set by separate resolution of the local governing body. 
                  (b)  Additional specifications. The land use officer is hereby authorized to prepare and recommend standard drawings and constructions specifications for private and public improvements not specified in this article.

                  (d)  Inspections. The land use officer, the mayor or appointed designee, and/or the city engineer shall be authorized to inspect premises proposed for subdivision or land development, including any improvements within such subdivision or land development, to determine compliance with the requirements of this article and other laws and regulations of the city. No person shall refuse entry or access to any person authorized to conduct inspections who presents appropriate credentials for the same, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such person while in the process of carrying out his official duties. The city may establish procedures for inspection of land development activity at various intervals in the development process, including, without limitation, inspection procedures for erosion control, the initiating of grading or land-disturbing activity, installation of on-site sewage disposal systems or sanitary sewer, installation of storm drainage pipe, detention, or other stormwater facilities, and installation of street curbing and gutter, road subgrade, base, or paving. 
                  (e)  Enforcement, violations, remedies, and penalties. Enforcement, violations, remedies and penalties shall be as specified in section 26-27. 
                  (f)  Amendment. The mayor and city council may amend this article in a manner consistent with state law. Before enacting such amendment to this article, the planning committee shall provide a recommendation on the proposed amendment. The mayor and city council shall hold a public hearing thereon, notice of which shall be published at least 15 days prior to such hearing in the city's legal organ or a newspaper of general circulation in the county.

                  Sec. 26-139. - Purposes. 
                  It is important for a community to appear clean, well kept, and generally clear of public nuisances, eyesores, and unhealthy conditions. The appearance of a community weighs heavily in the decisions of prospective residents and businesses in locating to a particular area. A clean, safe, and well-kept community can stabilize or increase property values, provide a healthy environment, and make citizens proud of the area in which they live. Accordingly, a community needs a set of regulations to keep the area clean, remove unsightly conditions, and prevent unhealthy and unsafe situations from occurring. It is therefore the purpose and intent of this article to encourage a clean, healthy, and satisfying environment; one free of nuisances, eyesores, and unhealthy, unsafe, or devaluating conditions. To this end, this article seeks to regulate and protect the health, safety, welfare, values, and aesthetics of properties.

                  Fire hazard means any type or collection of brush, lumber, rubbish, combustible material or chemicals, which would cause a threat to neighboring homes or structures if such materials were engulfed in fire, may constitute a fire hazard within the city. Due to threat to life or property, the city may take action to abate the hazard as a nuisance. Notwithstanding, prior to any action by the city, the city and its staff shall consult with the county fire chief and seek his opinion as to the condition of the property. In the event the city is advised that a fire hazard is present, the city may take action to abate the hazard as a nuisance. 
                  Nuisance means anything that causes hurt, inconvenience, or damage to another, and the fact that the act done may otherwise be lawful, shall not keep it from being a nuisance. The inconvenience complained of shall not be fanciful, or such as would affect only one of fastidious taste, but it shall be such as would affect an ordinary, reasonable person.

                  Sec. 26-176. - Manufactured home parks. 
                  (a)  Purpose. This section regulates mobile home parks, manufactured home parks, and recreational vehicle and travel trailer parks and campgrounds, which provide for affordable permanent and temporary housing or seasonal recreational developments. Manufactured home parks are intended to provide for the leasing of spaces for the placement of manufactured homes, owned or rented by tenants, as well as spaces or campsites for recreational vehicles, within a planned residential community, park, or campground. A manufactured home park is different from a residential subdivision in that the individual spaces for manufactured homes, campsites, or recreational vehicles are leased rather than platted and sold. By requiring less land per home or vehicle space, manufactured home parks are built at densities greater than those for other detached dwellings. Service facilities such as laundry and leasing offices are often planned and provided as a part of the park development. 
                  (b)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Accessory building means a building subordinate to the main building on a lot or space and used for purposes customarily incidental to those of the main building or use. 
                  Active recreational facilities means equipment and areas prepared for active use for recreational and leisure purposes, including, but not limited to: playground equipment (swing sets and climbing structures); courts for basketball, volleyball, and tennis; leveled, striped fields for football, soccer, or all-purpose fields; community picnic pavilion (including covered facilities with grills and/or fire pits); and community buildings for recreational events. Trails and bikeways through open spaces shall not be considered active recreational facilities. 
                  Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections which, in the traveling mode, is eight body feet or more in width or 40 body feet or more in length; when erected on-site, is 320 or more square feet in floor area, and which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used as a dwelling with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities, and includes the plumbing, heating, air conditioning, and electrical systems contained therein; or a structure that otherwise comes within the definition of the term "manufactured home" under the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974, as amended (42 USC 5401—5445). 
                  Manufactured home park means a parcel of land, or any portion thereof, under which has been designed, planned, or improved for the placement of two or more manufactured homes for residential use, including land, buildings, and facilities used by the occupants of manufactured homes on such property. Also referred to as land-lease communities. 
                  Manufactured home space means a parcel of land within a manufactured home park which is reserved or leased for the placement of an individual manufactured home and accessory structures for the exclusive use of its occupants. 
                  Mobile home means a structure, transportable in one or more sections which, in the traveling mode, is eight body feet or more in width or 40 body feet or more in length; when erected on-site, is 320 or more square feet in floor area, and which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used as a dwelling with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities, and includes the plumbing, heating, air conditioning, and electrical systems contained therein; and which has not been inspected and approved as meeting the requirements of the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974, as amended, 42 USC 5401—5445. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicular-type portable structure without a permanent foundation that can be towed, hauled, or driven and is primarily designed as a temporary living accommodation for recreational, camping, and travel use which includes, but is not limited to, travel trailers, truck campers, camping trailers, and self-propelled motor homes. 
                  (c)  Site plan review and land use permit required. No manufactured home park or other use subject to the requirements of this section shall be developed until and unless a site plan shall have been approved by the land use officer and city engineer and a land use permit is issued by the land use officer. The land use officer shall not issue a land use permit for a manufactured home park unless it is in conformity with all the provisions of this section. 
                  (d)  Site conditions and site planning. 
                  (1)  Site conditions. Manufactured home parks shall be sited on land that is not subject to hazards such as flooding, erosion, land subsidence, and areas with possible insect or rodent infestation. The condition of the soil, groundwater level, drainage, rock formations, and topography shall be appropriate for the use to ensure that no hazards to the property or to the health and safety of the occupants occurs. 
                  (2)  Site planning. Planning for the manufacturing home park should be adapted to individual site conditions and the type of use or uses served, reflect advances in site planning techniques, and be adapted to the trends in the design of the manufactured home or recreational vehicle itself. Site planning and improvements shall provide for facilities and amenities appropriate to the needs of the occupants, safe, comfortable, and sanitary use by the occupants under all weather conditions, and practical and efficient operation and maintenance of all facilities at reasonable costs. The street and block pattern for the park shall be designed to attain proper sizes and shapes of manufactured home spaces so as to provide desirable areas and to reduce excessive length of street construction without impairing convenient circulation and access. 
                  (e)  General development requirements. Manufactured home parks or other uses subject to the requirements of this section shall meet the following requirements:

                  (d)  Functions and duties. In addition to the functions and duties set by ordinance, the planning committee is hereby vested with the following additional powers and duties. The mere authorization to undertake these functions shall not be considered a mandate for the planning committee to perform all of these functions, nor shall it prohibit the discretion of the local governing body, by law or resolution, from assigning one or more of these functions to a staff member of the local government, or to another agency or committee. The mission of the planning committee shall be to make such careful and comprehensive surveys and studies of existing conditions and probable future developments and to prepare such plans for the physical, social, and economic growth as will best promote the public health, safety, morals, convenience, prosperity, and/or general welfare, including efficiency and economy in the development of its jurisdiction. In particular, the planning committee shall have the power and duty perform the following:

                  (5)  Review and approve subdivision plats; provided, however, that if the planning committee is given authority to grant approval of final plats, said approval shall not constitute acceptance of public improvements which is a power reserved by the local governing body. 
                  (6)  Prepare and recommend for adoption to the local governing body, a plat, or a corridor map, showing the location of the boundary lines of existing, proposed, extended, widened or narrowed streets and linear open spaces and recreational areas, together with regulations to control the erection of buildings or other structures within such lines, within the local jurisdiction or a specified portion thereof. 
                  (7)  Make, publish, and distribute maps, plans, reports, and recommendations relating to the planning and development of the local jurisdiction to public officials and agencies, public utility companies, civic, educational, professional, and other organizations and citizens.

                  Sec. 28-1. - Purpose and findings. 
                  It is the purpose of this chapter to ensure proper maintenance, for safety and structural soundness, as well as the appearance and attractiveness of signs. 
                  The mayor and council find that signs provide an important medium through which persons may convey a variety of messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and detriment to property values and the city's overall public welfare as an aesthetic nuisance. By enacting the ordinance from which this chapter derives, the mayor and council intend to: 
                  (a)  Balance the rights of persons to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs; 
                  (b)  Protect the public health, safety, and welfare; 
                  (c)  Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards; 
                  (d)  Maintain the historical image of the city; 
                  (e)  Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs; 
                  (f)  Promote economic development; and 
                  (g)  Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations. 
                  Be it ordained by the mayor and city council of Hiawassee that:

                  (c)  In recognition of the need for enhanced governmental services and in order to encourage private property owners to maintain their real property and the buildings, structures and improvement thereon in good condition and repair, and as an incentive to encourage community redevelopment, a community redevelopment tax incentive program is hereby established as authorized by article IX, section II, paragraph VII (d) of the 1983 constitution of the state.

                  Sec. 32-126. - Collection of tax by operator. 
                  (a)  It shall be the duty of every operator providing lodging accommodations within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city to collect the tax on occupants as imposed herein. Every operator furnishing guest rooms in a hotel within the city shall collect a tax of five percent on the amount of rent from the occupant unless an exemption is provided under section 32-125. The operator shall provide a receipt to each occupant, which receipt shall reflect both the amount of rent and the amounts of this and other tax applicable. This tax shall be due from the occupant, and shall be collected by the operator at the same time that the rent is collected. The operator shall be liable to the city for the full amount received or collected as tax, whether collected appropriately or inappropriately; and for any amount of tax that should have been collected, but was not. 
                  (b)  Any person who receives or collects the tax, or any consideration represented to be the tax, from another person holds the amount so collected in trust for the benefit of the city and is liable to the city for the full amount collected, plus penalty and interest.

The dissolution of a corporation, partnership or other business or fraternal association does not affect a responsible individual's liability under this subsection. Furthermore, the liability imposed by this subsection shall be in addition to any other penalty provided by law.

                  Sec. 32-127. - Registration of lodging operator. 
                  Every person engaging in, or about to engage in, the business of providing lodging accommodations, as above defined, in the special district shall immediately register said business with the city clerk's office, as the duly authorized representative of the city, a political subdivision of the state, on a form provided by the city clerk for such purpose. Persons engaged in such business must so register no later than 30 days after the date the ordinance from which this section is derived becomes effective, but such grace period for the filing of the registration after the effective date of the tax shall not relieve any person from the obligation of payment or collection of such tax on and after the date of imposition thereof. 
                  (1)  The required registration hereunder shall set forth the name under which the operator transacts business or intends to transact business; the location of the place of business, the mailing address of the business, the principal contact person at said business and such other information as would facilitate the collection of the tax. 
                  (2)  The registration shall be signed by the owner (if a natural person), by an officer (if a corporation) or a partner (if a partnership). 
                  (3)  A separate registration shall be required for each place of business of an operator; however, a realtor offering cabins for rent shall be deemed to be one place of business and shall not require a separate registration for each cabin rented. 
                  (4)  An operator offering more than one cabin or unit for rent under the same federal and state tax identification number shall be required to file the same number of returns as required by the state for the filing of state sales tax returns.

                  Sec. 32-128. - Certificate of taxing authority. 
                  Upon the registration of a lodging operator, as herein above provided, the city clerk shall issue to such lodging operator without charge a certificate of authority to collect the tax on the occupants. Each certificate shall state the name and location of the business or person to which it is applicable. Each certificate shall state the name and location of the business or person to which it relates. A separate registration shall be required for each place of business of an operator. Such certificates shall be nonassignable and nontransferable, and shall be returned immediately to the city clerk upon cessation of business by the registered operator at the location name, or upon sale or transfer of such business at such location.

                  (a)  All taxes levied by this article shall be due and payable to the city monthly, on or before the 20th day of every month following each monthly period in which taxes are collected. A return for the preceding monthly period, together with the appropriate remittance, shall be filed with the city clerk. The return shall report the gross rent, rent from permanent residents, taxable rent, amount of tax collected or otherwise due for the period, and such other information as may be required by the city clerk or governing authority of the city. 
                  (b)  In the event that an operator is permitted under applicable state guidelines to make annual or quarterly sales tax returns to the state, said operator shall be permitted to make quarterly sales tax returns to the city. At the time of registration, the operator shall indicate that he is permitted to make annual or quarterly sales tax returns together with month and day said returns are due. The failure of the operator to indicate that he is permitted under applicable state statute to file quarterly reports will infer that monthly reports are due and collectable. Operators that make annual filings to the state that file quarterly with the city shall file on January 20, April 20, June 20 and/or September 20. 
                  (c)  At the time any such report is due, the operator shall file a copy of the corresponding state sales tax return for the sole purpose of verifying the sums reported and due. 
                  (d)  In the event there are no rentals in a reporting period, operators are required to file a return to the city stating they had zero rentals for the period.

                  No later than the 25th day of each month, such excise taxes as have been paid under the provisions of this article shall be deposited to the city's hotel/motel tax fund and the statute-required portion of such funds shall thereafter, at the direction of the city council, be expended for the promotion of the tourism industry in the city; or, such funds may at the direction of the city council, otherwise be expended for the purpose of promoting tourism, conventions and trade shows as provided by statute.

                  Operators collecting the tax levied hereunder shall be allowed a percentage of the tax due and accounted for, and shall be reimbursed in the form of a deduction in submitting, reporting, and payment of the amount due. The rate of the deduction shall be three percent of the amount due, but only if the amount due was not delinquent at the time of payment. If the amount due was delinquent at the time of payment, no deduction shall be permitted.

                  Sec. 32-132. - Penalty and interest. 
                  (a)  Penalty for failure to pay tax. An operator who fails to pay the amount of tax as prescribed when due shall pay a penalty from and after the 20th day of the month following the monthly period for which the amount should have been returned until the date of payment of such tax and interest. The penalty shall be added to the tax in the amount of five percent of the amount due plus interest on the total amount of delinquent taxes at the rate of one percent per annum. In addition, the operator shall not be entitled to the fee allowed in section 32-131. The late penalty will be strictly enforced. 
                  (b)  Penalty for failure to file a return. 
                  (1)  If any operator fails to file a return, as required under the provisions of this section, the city shall make an estimate of the amount of gross rentals which are subject to the tax. The estimate shall be made for the period in which the operator failed to file the return and shall be based upon any information which is or may come into the possession of the city. 
                  (2)  The city clerk shall give to the operator written notice of determination as herein provided. The notice may be served personally or by mail; if by mail, such service shall be addressed to the operator at his last-known address as it appears on any of the city's records. Service by mail is complete when delivered by certified mail with a receipt signed by the addressee. 
                  (3)  The amount of the determination made hereunder shall bear interest at the rate of three-fourths of one percent per month, or a fraction thereof, from the 20th day of the month following the monthly period for which the amount or any portion thereof should have been returned, until the day of payment. 
                  (4)  In addition, a penalty of five percent of the tax due or $5.00, whichever is greater for each 30 days, or fraction thereof, of delinquency, not to exceed 25 percent or $25.00 in the aggregate, whichever is greater, shall be assessed and paid by the operator to the city. 
                  (5)  The estimated tax, together with applicable penalties and interest may be collected utilizing any of the enforcement methods set forth in this article. 
                  (6)  Acceptance of delinquent return and remittance without imposing penalty and interest. If the failure to make any return or to pay the amount of tax by the due date results from providential cause shown to the satisfaction of the governing authority of the city by affidavit attached to the return, and remittance is made within ten days of the due date, such return may be accepted. 
                  (7)  Waiving of penalty and interest; authority. O.C.G.A. § 48-2-41, relating to the authority to waive interest, and O.C.G.A. § 48-2-43, relating to the authority to waive penalty, shall apply; provided, however, that the governing authority shall stand in lieu of the state commissioner of revenue, and the city shall stand in lieu of the state. 
                  (8)  Penalty for fraud. In the case of a false or fraudulent return, or of failure to file a return and where willful intent exists to defraud the city of any tax due, a penalty of 50 percent of the amount due shall be assessed. 
                  (9)  Extension of time for making returns. The governing authority of the city may, for good cause, extend the time for making returns for not longer than 30 days. No extension shall be valid unless granted in writing upon written application of the operator. Such grant may not be applicable for longer than 12 consecutive months. An operator granted an extension shall remit tax equaling not less than 100 percent of the tax paid for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year; such remittance to be made on or before the date the tax would otherwise come due without the grant of extension. No penalty or interest shall be charged during the first ten days of the extension period. Thereafter, interest shall be collected on the unpaid balance at the rate of one percent per month.

                  (b)  If any operator becomes liable for any amount required to be paid by this section and subsequent thereto, sells or quits the business, the successors or assignees of such operator shall withhold a sufficient amount of the purchase price to cover such amount due.
