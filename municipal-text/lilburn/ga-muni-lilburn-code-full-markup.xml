PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Lilburn, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 2001 Code, as amended and ordinances adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 2001 Code, as supplemented, and any ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Diana Harper, Legal Tech Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Victoria Dufresne, Administrative Assistant, Mr. Thomas Combiths, City Manager, Mr. Richard Carothers, City Attorney, and the city staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

This reading may be accomplished by the reading of the caption. Ordinances shall be considered and adopted or rejected by the city council in accordance with the rules which it shall establish; except for emergency ordinances provided in Section 2.24. Either the mayor or any council member or council members may request that consideration of any proposed ordinance be delayed until the next regularly scheduled meeting of the governing authority. Said request need not be accompanied by any explanation or reason and shall automatically be delayed until the next regularly scheduling meeting of the governing authority without the necessity of said delay being approved or voted on by the governing authority. The delay of said consideration shall not be further postponed except by vote of the governing authority. Upon introduction of any ordinance, the clerk shall, as soon as reasonable, distribute a copy to the mayor and to each council member and shall file a reasonable number of copies in the office of the clerk and at such other public places as the city council may designate.

                  (c)  Whenever in opening, extending or widening any street, avenue, alley or public place of the city, a small parcel or tract of land is cut-off or separated by such work from a larger tract or boundary of land owned by the city, the city council may authorize the city manager to sell and convey said cut-off or separated parcel or tract of land to an abutting or adjoining property owner or owners where such sale and conveyance facilitates the enjoyment of the highest and best use of the abutting owner's property. Included in the sales contract shall be a provision for the rights of way of said street, avenue, alley or public place. Each abutting property owner shall be notified of the availability of the property and given the opportunity to purchase said property under such terms and conditions as set out by ordinance.

                  (b)  A license may be subjected to a supervised action plan, suspended or revoked by the city manager and/or his/her designee and/or the city council where the licensee furnishes fraudulent or untruthful information in the application for a license and for failure to pay all fees, taxes or other charges imposed under the provisions of this chapter. 
                  (c)  Whenever the state shall revoke any permit or license to sell alcoholic beverages, the city license shall thereupon be automatically revoked.

                  (d)  Any licensed establishment that is found to be in violation of any section of this chapter shall be subject to a hearing before the city manager and/or his/her designee as set forth in section 6-7 that may result in license revocation, suspension, or corrective action plan.

                  (j)  Wherever this chapter permits the city manager and/or his/her designee to mandate a supervised action plan, revoke or to suspend any license issued hereunder but does not mandate the period of such plan or suspension, such discretion shall be exercised within the guidelines of this section.

                  (1)  The notice shall be in writing and mailed by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery to the owner's last know address. If a dog has more than one owner, notice to one owner shall be sufficient for purposes of this article. If there is a question as to the dog's owner, notice shall be deemed sufficient if sent to the last person who received a citation for the dog. 
                  (2)  The notice shall include a summary of the dog control officer's findings that form the basis for the dog's classification as a dangerous dog or a potentially dangerous dog..

Within ten days of the date of the hearing, the board shall notify the owner in writing by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery of its determination on the matter. If the determination is made that the dog is a dangerous dog or potentially dangerous dog, the notice shall specify the date upon which that determination is effective. Unless the board determines that a later date is appropriate in a particular case, the effective date of the determination shall be the date of the dog control officer's classification. 
                  (c)  If the identity of the owner of a dog, which the dog control officer has classified as a dangerous dog or potentially dangerous dog, cannot be determined, the dog shall be immediately confiscated.

                  ARTICLE III. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS 

                  Sec. 14-56. - Findings; public purpose. 
                  (a)  Based on the experiences of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Houston, Texas, Tucson, Arizona, Chattanooga, Tennessee, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Dayton, Ohio, and Gwinnett County, Georgia, which experiences are found to be relevant to the problems faced by the City of Lilburn, and based on documentary evidence and oral presentation during the meeting of the mayor and council on September 10, 2001; and based upon the record of the Gwinnett County board of commissioners' public hearing and regular meeting on August 7, 2001, including the record of testimony by Colonel John Latty, Officer John Jenkins, and Investigator J. P. Droualt of the Gwinnett Police Department, and further comments in that meeting by representatives of the adult entertainment industry, the Mayor and Council of the City of Lilburn take note of the well-known and self-evident conditions and secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among the various communities within our country. 
                  (b)  It is the finding of the Mayor and Council of the City of Lilburn that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in establishments offering live nude entertainment or "adult entertainment," (whether such alcoholic beverages are sold on the premises or not) begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. In the same manner, establishments offering cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the community. 
                  (c)  Among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, live commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are disorderly conduct, prostitution, public solicitation, public indecency, drug use and drug trafficking. Among the undesirable community conditions identified in other communities with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment, are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior herein above described. The Mayor and Council of the City of Lilburn find it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions will result in the City of Lilburn, as well. 
                  (d)  Furthermore, it is the finding of the Mayor and Council of the City of Lilburn that other forms of adult entertainment including, but not limited to, adult book stores, adult novelty shops, adult video stores, peep shows, adult theaters, and massage parlors have an adverse effect upon the quality of life in surrounding communities. 
                  (e)  The Mayor and Council of the City of Lilburn find that the negative secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments upon the City of Lilburn are similar whether the adult entertainment establishment features live nude dancing or sells video tapes depicting sexual activities. In addition, Gwinnett County's experience with the adult bookstore located within the county has shown that a substantial amount of activity at the bookstore involves booths which an individual may enter, view videos depicting sexual activity, and sexually interact with a bookstore patron in an adjoining booth through a hole strategically placed in the wall of adjoining booths. 
                  (f)  The City of Lilburn, Georgia, therefore finds that it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community and the preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, and of churches, schools, residential areas, public parks and children's daycare facilities to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments. Therefore, the Mayor and Council of the City of Lilburn find that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult entertainment establishment. The Mayor and Council of the City of Lilburn find that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including but not limited to, reducing criminal activity and protecting against or eliminating undesirable community conditions and further find that such will not infringe upon the protected constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression, which rights are expressly acknowledged herein. To that end, the ordinance as codified in this chapter is hereby adopted.

No annual license for an adult entertainment establishment shall be issued by the city if the premises to be used also holds a license to sell alcoholic beverages or malt beverages and wine for consumption on the premises. Any premises licensed as an adult entertainment establishment shall not be eligible to apply at any time for a license to sell alcoholic beverages or malt beverages and wine for consumption on the premises.

In any event, no adult entertainment establishment license or renewal thereof shall be issued until the most recent annual regulatory fee has been paid. All licenses granted hereunder shall expire on December 31 of each year.

Applications for renewal must be filed before November 30 of each year.

If a license renewal application is received after January 1, such application shall be treated as an initial application and the applicant shall be required to comply with all rules and regulations for the granting of licenses as if no previous license had been held. If a license application is received after January 1, investigative and administrative costs as hereinafter set forth in this chapter will be assessed. All licenses granted hereunder shall be for the calendar year, and the full annual regulatory fee must be paid for a license renewal application filed prior to July 1 of the license year. One-half of a full annual regulatory fee shall be paid for a license renewal application filed after July 1 of the license year.

                  Sec. 14-275. - Findings: Public purpose. 
                  (a)  Based on the experiences of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Houston, Texas, Tucson, Arizona, Chattanooga, Tennessee, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Dayton, Ohio, and Gwinnett County, Georgia, which experiences are found to be relevant to the problems faced by the City of Lilburn, and based on documentary evidence and oral presentation during the meeting of the mayor and council on September 10, 2001; and based upon the record of the Gwinnett County board of commissioners' public hearing and regular meeting on August 7, 2001, including the record of testimony by Colonel John Latty, Officer John Jenkins, and Investigator J. P. Droualt of the Gwinnett police department, and further comments in that meeting by representatives of the adult entertainment industry, the Mayor and Council of the City of Lilburn take note of the opportunity for unlawful sexual activities including, but not limited to, masturbation and oral and anal sex to occur at video stores which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films or videos depicting nudity, and for sexually transmitted diseases to spread as a result of the unhealthy conditions and unlawful activities associated with such booths, and the Mayor and Council of the City of Lilburn further note that persons frequent such video viewing booths for the purpose of engaging in sexual activities within such video viewing booths, and bodily fluids, including semen, urine and feces are found in such video viewing booths. 
                  (b)  The Mayor and Council of the City of Lilburn find that removal of doors on such video viewing booths and prohibiting holes between such booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in such booths. The Mayor and Council of the City of Lilburn therefore find that it is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the community to require that doors or other partitions on video viewing booths in video stores be removed and that no holes be allowed to exist between adjoining booths. The mayor and council find that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including, but not limited to, reducing unlawful sexual activities and unhealthy conditions in video viewing booths found in video stores. The mayor and council further find that these regulations will not infringe upon the protected Constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression. To that end, the ordinance as codified in this article is hereby adopted.

                  (c)  The mayor and council have considered the experiences and challenges that counties and municipalities around the state and the country are experiencing regarding the prescribing and dispensing of controlled substances and pain medications to those individuals visiting so-called pain management clinics, sometimes referred to as "pill mills" and find them relevant and informative regarding the protection of the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Lilburn. 
                  (d)  The mayor and council note the legislative enactments of Kennesaw and Cherokee County with regard thereto, including their extensive recitation of findings regarding pill mills from various public bodies in the State of Florida, and find them relevant and informative regarding the protection of the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Lilburn. 
                  (e)  The mayor and council find that these pill mills operating as so-called pain management clinics or facilities often prescribe and/or prescribe and dispense Schedule II, III, and IV controlled substances as those substances are identified in O.C.G.A. §§ 16-13-25—16-13-29, to those claiming pain without performing proper and thorough examinations of said patients and their medical records, without a proper medical diagnosis, and without oversight of licensed medical personnel. 
                  (f)  The mayor and council find that a typical pill mill operating as so-called pain management clinic or facility prescribes and/or prescribes and dispenses controlled substances and pain medications on-site. 
                  (g)  The mayor and council have reviewed information received from law enforcement officials and find that criminal activity tends to increase in areas where these pill mills operating as so-called pain management clinics or facilities are located. 
                  (h)  The mayor and council have been made aware of reports describing a "pipeline" of trafficking drugs from these pill mills operating as so-called pain management clinics or facilities in South Florida through the State of Georgia to users in other states such as Kentucky, West Virginia, and Ohio and find them relevant and informative regarding the protection of the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Lilburn. 
                  (i)  The mayor and council find that prescription drug abuse is a major problem in Georgia and throughout the United States, and according to the Georgia Drug and Narcotics Agency, deaths due to prescription drug overdoses have surpassed those of all other illicit drugs. 
                  (j)  The mayor and council are aware that Georgia law provides for a prescription medication monitoring program, but it appears that such monitoring system will not be operational until some time in 2013. 
                  (k)  The mayor and council find it is necessary and appropriate to adopt this article to require certain information upon application for a business license by pain management clinics for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Lilburn.

                  (a)  Insofar as practicable, sound will be measured while the source under investigation is operating at normal, routine conditions. 
                  (b)  All tests shall be conducted in accordance with the following procedures: 
                  (1)  The noise investigator shall, to the extent practicable, identify all sources contributing sound to the point of measurement. 
                  (2)  Measurements shall be taken at the property line of the property receiving the noise under investigation from 7:00 a.m. until 9:59 p.m. Measurements shall be taken at or within the property line of the property from which the sound/noise source under investigation is coming from 10:01 p.m. to 6:59 a.m. 
                  (3)  The measuring instrument must be calibrated using a calibrator recommended by the measuring instrument manufacturer before and after each series of readings. 
                  (4)  No outdoor measurements shall be taken: 
                  a.  When wind speeds (including gusts) exceed 15 mph; 
                  b.  Without a windscreen, recommended by the measuring instrument manufacturer, properly attached to the measuring instrument: 
                  c.  Under any condition that allows the measuring instrument to become wet (e.g., rain, snow, or condensation); or 
                  d.  When the ambient temperature is out of the range of the tolerance of the measuring instrument. 
                  (c)  Prior to taking noise measurements the noise investigator shall explore the vicinity of the source in question to identify any other sound sources that could affect measurements, to establish the approximate location and character of the principal sound source, and to select suitable locations from which to measure the sound from the source in question. 
                  (d)  When measuring continuous sound, or sound that is sustained for more than one second at a time, the measuring instrument shall be set for A-weighting, slow response, and the range (if the measuring instrument is designed to read levels over different ranges) shall be set to that range in which the meter reads closest to the middle of the scale. The minimum and maximum readings shall be recorded to indicate the range of monitored values along with the central tendency average most often displayed. 
                  (e)  The measuring instrument shall be placed at a minimum height of three feet above the ground or from any reflective surface. When handheld, the microphone shall be held at arm's length and pointed at the source at the angle recommended by the measuring instruments manufacturer. 
                  (f)  If extraneous sound sources, such as aircraft flyovers or barking dogs, that are unrelated to the measurements increase the monitored sound levels, the measurements should be postponed until these extraneous sounds have become of such a level as not to increase the monitored sound levels of interest. 
                  (g)  The monitoring session should last for a period of time sufficient to ensure that the sound levels measured are typical of the source in question.

                  Sec. 42-79. - Immunity. 
                  Registration of an alarm system is not intended to, nor does it, create a contract, duty or obligation, either expressed or implied, of response by a law enforcement agency. Any and all liability and consequential damage resulting from the failure to respond to an alarm dispatch request is hereby disclaimed and governmental immunity as provided by law is retained. By registering an alarm system, the alarm user acknowledges that law enforcement response may be based on factors such as availability of police units, priority of calls, weather conditions, traffic conditions, emergency conditions and/or staffing levels.

                  (a)  An alarm user shall: 
                  (1)  Maintain the premises and the alarm system in a manner that will minimize or eliminate false alarms; and 
                  (2)  Respond or cause a representative to respond to the alarm site within 30 minutes when requested by the police department to deactivate a malfunctioning alarm system, to provide access to the premises, or to provide alternative security for the premises. 
                  (b)  An alarm user shall adjust the alarm system or cause the alarm system to be adjusted so that an alarm signal audible on the exterior of an alarm site will sound for no longer than 15 minutes for any audible alarm system. 
                  (c)  An alarm user shall have an alarm company inspect the alarm system after two false alarms in a one-year period from the date of registration or renewal. The alarm user must submit written certification from an alarm company stating that the alarm system has been inspected and that repairs or modifications, if necessary, have been made. The alarm administrator may waive an inspection requirement if it determines that a false alarm(s) could not have been related to a defect or malfunction in the alarm system. After four false alarms within a one-year period from the date of registration issuance or renewal, the alarm user must have an alarm company modify the alarm system to be more false alarm resistant and/or to provide additional alarm user training as appropriate. 
                  (d)  An alarm user shall maintain at each alarm site a set of written operating instructions for each alarm system.

                  (2)  Transmit a false alarm; or 
                  (3)  Activate, except in the event of an actual emergency, any alarm system for the purpose of summoning a law enforcement response; or 
                  (4)  Notify the police department directly through the E-911 system of any alarm activation by means of an auto-dialer, or telephonic recording, message, signal or warning; or 
                  (5)  Aid or abet in the commission of an act prohibited in this section. 
                  (b)  Any responsible person violating or failing to comply with any of the provisions of this article may be summoned to municipal court for each violation and/or instance of noncompliance and, upon conviction, shall be punished as provided by a fine not to exceed $500.00 and by imprisonment not to exceed 60 days, or both.

                  (c)  The alarm administrator shall notify in writing the alarm user of the amount of the fees assessed after the first, second, and third false alarms. A copy of the fees for false alarms as set forth in this section shall be included in the first notice. In the event the alarm user is exempted pursuant to section 42-86, the chief of police shall send written notice to such an alarm user notifying such alarm user of the false alarm problem(s) occurring at the alarm site. Notice shall be deemed received if sent via United States mail addressed to the alarm user as provided by section 42-78(e)(1) or (e)(4) of this article. 
                  (d)  In the event an alarm user is convicted for transmitting a false alarm pursuant to section 42-81(b) of this article, any applicable fees shall be waived in lieu of the criminal penalty assessed.

                  (b)  Appeals must be submitted to the chief of police within 15 days of the date on which notice of a fee is sent. 
                  (c)  If the appeal is denied, the alarm administrator shall send written notice to the appellant of the action. 
                  (d)  The decision of the chief of police or his designee will be the final decision of the city regarding the assessment of a fee.

                  (1)  Designate the manner, form and telephone numbers for the communication of alarm dispatch requests; and 
                  (2)  Establish a procedure to accept cancellation of alarm dispatch requests.

                  (c)  If there is reason to believe that an alarm system is not being used or maintained in a manner that ensures proper operation and suppresses false alarms, the alarm administrator may require a conference with an alarm user and/or the alarm company to review the circumstances of each false alarm.

                  In addition to the other remedies herein provided for the collection of the occupation tax herein levied, the licensing and revenue manager, upon any tax becoming delinquent and remaining unpaid, shall issue execution for the correct amount of such tax against the persons, partnership or corporation liable for such tax, which such execution shall bear interest at the rate specified in O.C.G.A. § 48-13-21 from the date when such tax becomes delinquent, and the lien shall cover the property in Lilburn of the person, partnership or corporation liable for such tax, all as provided by the ordinances of the city, county and the laws of the state. The lien of such occupation tax shall become fixed on and date from the time when such tax becomes delinquent. The execution shall be levied by the sheriff or tax commissioner of the county upon the property of defendant located in such county or in any other location if no property remains in the city and sufficient property shall be advertised and sold to pay the amount of such execution, with interest and costs. All other proceedings in relation thereto shall be had as is provided by ordinances and charter of such county and the laws of the state, and the defendant in such execution shall have rights of defense, by affidavit of illegality and otherwise, which are provided by ordinance or the laws of the state in regard to tax executions. When a nulla bona entry has been entered by proper authority upon an execution issued by the licensing and revenue manager against any person defaulting on the occupation tax, the person against whom the entry was made shall not be allowed or entitled to have or collect any fees or charges whatsoever for services rendered after the entry of the nulla bona. If, at any time after the entry of nulla bona has been made, the person against whom the execution issues pays the tax in full together with all interest and costs accrued on the tax, the person may collect any fees and charges due him as though he had never defaulted in the payment of the taxes.

Such amendment may increase or lower the amounts and tax rates of any occupation and may change the classification thereof. The payment of any occupation tax provided for shall not be construed as prohibiting the levy or collection by the city of additional occupation taxes upon the same person, property or business.

                  In the event an application for a revocable license would cause a person to exceed or fail to comply with the limits specified in this section, then such person must apply for a franchise in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, and the use of specifically identified streets pursuant to all previously granted revocable licenses shall thereafter be pursuant to and in accordance with any such franchise that may be granted.

                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in section 109-24(b) and (c) of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in (c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 109-24(b)(2) of this article; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50 foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25 foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (17)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to Code section 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to Code section 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in section 109-24(b) and (c) of this article. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 393-10, 10-11-2010; Ord. No. 2016-507, 11-7-2016) 
                  Sec. 109-25. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of City of Lilburn without first obtaining a permit from the department of planning and economic development to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the department of planning and economic development and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 109-25(c) of this article. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 109-24(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by two copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 109-24(c)(15), (16) and (17) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per section 109-25(b)(6), has been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 109-24(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 109-24(c)(15), (16) and (17) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per section 109-25(b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
                  (Ord. No. 393-10, 10-11-2010; Ord. No. 2016-507, 11-7-2016) 
                  Sec. 109-26. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The department of planning and economic development will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its articles to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)  The department of planning and economic development shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  Sec. 109-27. - Penalties and incentives. 
                  (a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  (b)  Stop-work orders. 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and; 
                  (3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  (4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop-work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop-work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls.

                  (2)  Flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas; 
                  (3)  Effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can: 
                  a.  Protect human life and health; 
                  b.  Minimize damage to private property; 
                  c.  Minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; and 
                  d.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; and, 
                  (4)  Article IX, section II of the State Constitution and section 36-1-20(a) of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city does ordain this article and establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction policies for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property.

                  (2)  In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. 
                  This term includes structures which have incurred "repetitive loss" or "substantial damage" regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the structure commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions. Where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction of improvement commenced. 
                  Variance. A grant of relief from the requirements of this article that permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certificates, or other evidence of compliance required in this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  Sec. 109-67. - Floodway encroachments. 
                  (a)  Application procedure. 
                  (1)  An application for a development permit which proposes any encroachment into or alteration of a floodway shall require submittal to the city complete plans and engineering calculations as required by this article for "no rise" certification. 
                  (2)  The city shall review and authorize such floodway encroachments prior to the issuance of a development permit and shall obtain from the applicant an engineering "no-rise" certification signed by a professional engineer stating that the proposed development will not create any change to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths 
                  (3)  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries or base flood elevations, no permit authorizing an encroachment into or the alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the city until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable, is issued and "no rise" certification is approved by the city. 
                  (4)  An application for a map revision shall be submitted first to the city. As-built plans and calculations shall be required to be provided to the department by the applicant at the time of completion of the floodway encroachment. 
                  (5)  Payment of any review fees associated with the review and approval of the encroachment shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Final plats or certificates of occupancy shall not be issued by the city until an affirmative letter of map revision (LOMR) or letter of map amendment (LOMA), whichever is applicable, is issued. 
                  (b)  Flood levels resulting from floodway encroachments: Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris, or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without an increase in flood heights. Therefore, the following shall apply: 
                  (1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including but not limited to fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other developments within a regulatory floodway except for activities specifically allowed in (2) below. 
                  (2)  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  (3)  In areas where the floodplain has been established but the base flood elevation (BFE) and/or the floodway has not been established on FIS maps, no encroachments into areas of special flood hazard, including fill or structures, shall be authorized unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided to the city demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the floodplain more than 0.01 foot at any point. The study shall be submitted as a revision/amendment to the FIS maps showing the BFE and the floodway. Approval of the revision/amendment must be received before the final plat can be approved or a certificate of occupancy can be issued. 
                  (4)  In areas beyond the limits of study on the flood boundary and floodways maps or FIRM, which contains a watercourse, and have greater than 100 acres of surface drainage area above the property, no increase in flood elevations off-site shall be authorized.

                  The wetlands within Lilburn, Georgia are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well being of many communities within the State of Georgia. Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. It is therefore necessary for Lilburn, Georgia to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities that may adversely affect wetlands.

                  The generalized wetland map is a general reference document, and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of engineers guidance as to whether a permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of Lilburn and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of engineers, as required by the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this chapter does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.

Issuance of a local development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. All activities that are not identified in this article or by other local development ordinances, shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a local development permit. If the area proposed for development is located within 100 feet of the Wetland Protection District boundary, as determined from the generalized wetland map, a U.S. Army Corps of engineers determination shall be required. If the corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site and that a permit or letter of permission is required, a local development permit will be issued only following issuance of the permit or letter of permission

                  (b)  Variance procedures. Variance requests from the requirements of this article shall be submitted on an application form as prescribed by the director or the director's designee, along with such fees as shall be established by the city council. The director or the director's designee shall coordinate the review of each variance request with all other affected departments and shall forward such comments or recommendations as may be received to the zoning board of appeals (ZBA) for action in their normal course of business. The review must include a recommendation from the city. 
                  This section describes how to apply for a variance from this article, however, any activity within the 25-foot state waters' buffer must meet state (GA EPD) requirements. 
                  Variances may be granted in accordance with the following provisions:

The city shall post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing at least 15 days prior to the date of the hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way. 
                  No application or reapplication for a variance affecting the same stream segment on a property shall be heard within 12 months from the date of last action by the city unless such 12-month period is waived by the city, and in no case may such application or reapplication be reconsidered in less than six months from the date of last action by the city.

                  (1)  Balance the rights of persons to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs; 
                  (2)  Protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens and others within the city; 
                  (3)  Reduce traffic hazards, pedestrian hazards, and other hazards; 
                  (4)  Promote and maintain the aesthetic qualities of the city; 
                  (5)  Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs; 
                  (6)  Promote economic development; 
                  (7)  Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations; 
                  (8)  Promote the stated purposes of the City of Lilburn zoning ordinance, as amended, which are expressly incorporated herein; and

                  Section 204. - Official zoning map. 
                  1.  The boundaries of zoning districts and overlay district(s) created by this Zoning Ordinance are hereby established as shown on a map entitled the "Official Zoning Map" of the City of Lilburn, Georgia. 
                  2.  The official zoning map and all explanatory matter thereon accompany and are hereby made a part of this article. The official zoning map shall indicate the date of adoption and most recent amendment. The original of the official zoning map shall be kept in the planning and economic development department. 
                  3.  The official zoning map shall be considered the same as the "Official Comprehensive Zoning Map, City of Lilburn, Georgia," as referenced in the Lilburn City Charter. 
                  4.  The official zoning map may be kept electronically in a geographic information system and such electronic data shall constitute an integral part of the official zoning map. 
                  Section 205. - Amendment of official zoning map. 
                  If, in accordance with the provisions of this article, the Lilburn City Council approves changes in the district boundaries or other subject matter portrayed on the official zoning map, such changes shall be made promptly after the amendment or change has been approved by the Lilburn City Council. Once an amendment to the official zoning map has been approved by the Lilburn City Council, it shall be considered an administrative action to amend the official zoning map to properly depict the map amendment approved by the Lilburn City Council, and additional approval or action by council shall not be necessary. 
                  Section 206. - Correction and update of property lines on official zoning map. 
                  1.  The director is authorized to correct or update property lines depicted on the official zoning map, as such changes to the tax records of the city are made through land subdivision and combination of lots, without a requirement to seek approval of the Lilburn City Council, provided that such changes to property lines do not affect a zoning or overlay district boundary except as otherwise specifically provided in this section. 
                  2.  In any instance where the property lines as shown on the official zoning map deviate from a boundary survey prepared by a registered land surveyor for the lot or tract in question, and such deviation is attributed by the director to a drafting error or imperfection in the property parcel data base originally used in preparing the official zoning map, the director is authorized to correct the official zoning map to show the boundaries of the zoning or overlay district to follow the boundaries as shown on said boundary survey. Any such correction shall be considered an administrative action, and additional approval or action by council shall not be necessary to correct the official zoning map. 
                  Section 207. - Rules governing boundaries. 
                  This section shall govern administrative determinations by the director in cases where there is uncertainty with regard to the zoning and/or overlay district boundaries shown on the official zoning map. Where such uncertainty exists, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  1.  City limit lines. Where boundaries are indicated as approximately following the corporate limit line of the city, such corporate limit line shall be construed to be such boundaries. 
                  2.  Property lines. Where boundaries are indicated as following property lines, such property lines shall be construed to be such boundaries. The boundaries shall be determined on the basis of the legal descriptions or boundary surveys associated with approved map amendments, where available. 
                  3.  Stream and river beds. Where boundaries are indicated as approximately following the centerline of stream beds or river beds, or the outer edge of such stream bed or river bed, such centerline or edge of stream or river bed shall be construed to be such boundaries. 
                  4.  Abandonment. Where a public street or other right-of-way is officially vacated or abandoned and said street or right-of-way is also a zoning district or overlay district boundary, the regulations applicable to the property to which it reverted shall apply to such vacated or abandoned public street or right-of-way. 
                  5.  Administrative determination. In any case where the exact location of a boundary cannot be determined by the foregoing methods, the director shall determine the location of the boundary. Any such administrative determination is subject to appeal as an administrative decision in accordance with Article 10 of this Zoning Ordinance.

                  Section 301. - Use, occupancy and erection. 
                  No building, structure, land, or water shall hereafter be used or occupied, and no building or structure or part thereof shall be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in conformity with the regulations of this article or amendments thereto, including the use provisions for the zoning district in which it is located, the overlay district provisions if applicable, and any specific use provisions, if applicable. 
                  Section 302. - Use prohibited when not specified. 
                  Any use not specifically permitted as a use by right or specifically indicated as a conditional use in any given zoning district as provided in Article 4 shall be prohibited in that zoning district. 
                  Section 303. - Specific use provisions. 
                  In cases where a use is a permitted use in the zoning district in which said use is located but there are specific use regulations for that use specified in Article 7, such regulations shall also apply and must be complied with. It shall be unlawful to establish a use without conforming to the specific use provisions of this article, when applicable. 
                  Section 304. - Minimum requirements. 
                  Within each zoning district, the regulations set forth shall be minimum requirements and shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of building, structure or land, except as may be altered through conditions of zoning applied to specific properties. 
                  Section 305. - Every use must be upon a lot of record. 
                  No building or structure shall be erected or use established unless upon a lot of record as defined by this article, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Zoning Ordinance. 
                  Section 306. - One single-family dwelling on a lot. 
                  Except as otherwise specifically provided in this article, only one single-family dwelling and its accessory buildings may be erected on any one lot intended for such use. This provision shall not be construed to prevent the construction of more than one detached single-family condominium, or multiple-family dwelling on a single lot, in districts where permitted, subject to setbacks and separation as provided in this article. 
                  Section 307. - Height limitations. 
                  Except as otherwise specifically provided in this section or City Code, no building or structure shall hereafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed, or altered, to exceed the maximum height of buildings and structures specified in this article; provided, however, the city council may upon application and approval of a conditional use allow buildings and structures to exceed these height limitations, subject to procedures for conditional uses established in Article 4.

No lot shall hereafter be developed that fails to meet the minimum lot size and minimum lot width for the zoning district in which the lot is located as established by this article, except as otherwise specifically provided. No lot shall be reduced in size, and no principal building shall hereafter be constructed, so that the maximum density, minimum lot size, or minimum lot width of the zoning district in which said lot and building are located are not maintained, except as otherwise specifically provided in this article. 
                  Section 309. - Lot size averaging. 
                  Where unique site specific conditions exist, such as an irregular shape or other unique conditions, an infill developer or subdivider may propose and the city may approve a flexible development incentive called lot size averaging. This incentive allows development applicants to reduce one or more lots below the minimum lot size established for the zoning district in which the residential infill development project is located. In order to apply this provision, the proposed residential infill development project must meet the following requirements: 
                  1.  The average lot area of all lots within the subdivision meets the minimum lot size for the zoning district in which the project is located. 
                  2.  No lot shall be reduced to less than 80 percent of the required minimum lot size for the applicable zoning district. 
                  3.  For purposes of calculating average lot size, abutting undivided and undeveloped property under the ownership of the infill subdivider at the time of infill subdivision shall not be included in such calculation.

                  Section 313. - Minimum required yards and building setbacks. 
                  1.  No building or structure shall hereafter be erected in a manner to have narrower or smaller front yards, side yards, or rear yards than specified for the zoning district in which the property is located. Buffer requirements established by this article, where applicable, supersede these minimum required yards. In the case where a build-to line is established, the build-to line provisions of this article supersede and replace any front building setback lines, the latter of which shall only be deemed applicable in the absence of an established build-to line. 
                  2.  No lot shall be reduced in size, and no principal building shall hereafter be constructed, so that the front, side, or rear yards of the zoning district in which said lot and building are located are not maintained.

At the option of the development applicant, an applicant may submit a conceptual lot platting plan and defer the plat approval process until a later date, but if so, the applicant is still responsible for submitting information required by this article with respect to proposed lot boundaries as a part of the site design and architectural review process, so that subdivision lot design and specific residential development proposals can be considered as a whole. 
                  In considering the compatibility and appropriateness of residential, commercial, and mixed-use development within the city, it is important that the city consider not only the proposed lot lines and lot platting configurations, but also the specific development types proposed on the lots. The process for acting on infill residential development projects is accomplished by filing information required for both site design and architectural review and information required for applications for plat approval. 
                  Section 324. - Existing dwellings and infill development comparison. 
                  The department shall review residential infill development proposals in the context of the surrounding neighborhood. An applicant for a development permit or subdivision plat approval shall submit the following information for existing residential dwellings on abutting residential properties and across the street from the lot on which the residential infill development project is proposed. An applicant may exclude lots abutting the proposed residential infill development project which are developed for institutional uses, such as schools and churches, or other nonresidential uses. 
                  1.  Number of stories and approximate height. 
                  2.  Size (gross square feet) in area. 
                  3.  Front, side, and rear setbacks. 
                  4.  Orientation of the dwelling in relation to the street. 
                  5.  Major architectural features (style, materials, etc.). 
                  6.  Driveway placement, width, and materials. 
                  7.  Location of parking (garage, carport, open, yard location, etc.). 
                  8.  Accessory buildings and structures, if any. 
                  The applicant may submit this information in a combination of forms, including an aerial photograph, tax map, survey plats, photographs, and written narrative, provided all required information is submitted. 
                  Section 325. - Floodplain general provisions.

                  405-1 Purpose and intent. The purpose of the IA district is twofold: to provide suitable areas for service-oriented business, and industrial operations and processes integrated with office and/or showroom uses, and related ancillary retail and service activities, with a minimum of interference from traffic and conflicting uses; and to provide and protect areas for processing, fabricating, manufacturing, warehousing, and research industrial uses which do not create noise, odor, smoke, vibration, dust or other emissions and which do not possess other objectionable characteristics that might be detrimental to surrounding neighborhoods or other uses permitted in the district. This district also includes more intensive auto repair establishments and those industrial uses which cannot comply with the limited emissions characteristics, but do comply with all state and federal guidelines for emissions and discharge of effluents into the air, water, and soil, subject to administrative conditional approval or special use permit. 
                  Site standards and design/screening measures are required. Outdoor storage and display is permitted in this district with regulation in association with specified uses in this district.

                  Section 406. - MU, Mixed-Use District. 
                  406-1 Purpose and intent. The MU district accommodates creative development alternatives along Lilburn's arterials in appropriate locations in order to promote redevelopment of under-utilized properties and support the transitioning of these areas from primarily low density residential to office, professional, community and neighborhood scale commercial, retail and services. Mixed-use development provides a compatible mix of non-residential uses with housing opportunities within the immediate area, either in the same building or in close proximity, while maintaining a healthy living environment for the residents of the district. 
                  Objectives of this district are to: 
                  • Encourage the redevelopment of tracts within the city by allowing flexible, innovative and creative concepts in site planning, and the efficient reuse of land in transitioning areas. 
                  • Provide a stable multiple-use environment compatible with adjacent uses. 
                  • Protect neighboring properties by allowing less intensive uses adjoining residential uses. 
                  This type of development offers a variety of housing options, including varying density multifamily, detached cluster, single family attached units and townhomes, upper floor residential, condominiums and active adult and/or senior housing. Residential products may be stand-alone within the district, incorporated as a component of a mixed-use project; or as an element of a mixed-use building. Transportation impacts are often reduced because fewer residents need to rely on the automobile to get to commercial areas, and walking and bicycling are encouraged. 
                  The MU Flexible District is specifically applicable to properties within the Mixed-Use Redevelopment (MUR) Overlay and the Transit Oriented Development Character Areas as depicted on the Lilburn 2030 Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map. All properties within the these Character Areas on Lilburn's official Future Development Map are eligible to apply for rezoning to the Mixed-Use Zoning District. Triggers for rezoning to MU Zone may include application for a change in use, the adaptive reuse of an existing structure, redevelopment of an underutilized property, or new development on primarily vacant land.

                  Section 502. - Town Center (TC) Overlay District. 
                  502-1 Purpose and intent. The Town Center Overlay District provides a template for establishing a mixed-use, main street character. The historic features of the Town Center Overlay District provide Main Street and Old Town with unique opportunities for mixed-use development projects that will give character to the streetscape, relate to the surrounding area through character and design, are close to local services and facilities, are oriented to encourage community interaction, foster the use of pedestrian and bicycle transportation, and include commercial land uses that are intended to serve the needs of local residents. 
                  The Town Center Overlay District is not a zoning district. It is an area that has been identified to provide new residential and commercial opportunities through redevelopment and infill development. Within the Town Center Overlay District, the uses permitted by the underlying zoning district are allowed unless expressly prohibited. 
                  The Town Center Overlay District shall provide an opportunity for development of residential, commercial, and mixed use projects. These regulations are intended to provide flexibility in design; encourage a mixture of uses; promote opportunities to live and work in the same space; and to encourage multiple uses in one building or development. 
                  502-2 Boundaries and map. The Town Center Overlay District standards shall apply to all property within the district boundary as shown on the Official Zoning Map of Lilburn which is hereby adopted and made a part of this ordinance, and which may be amended from time to time in accordance with the procedures established in this zoning ordinance. 
                  This article shall not apply to applications for building permits for accessory structures 400 square feet or less in area. This article shall not apply to a remodel of an existing dwelling or a permit proposal which would increase the existing ground floor area of a dwelling by less than 25%. 
                  502-3 Permitted uses. Permitted and conditional uses shall be as provided in Article 6, "Use and Supplemental Conditions Tables." In cases where a use is permitted but there are specific use regulations for that use specified in Article 7, such regulations shall also apply and must be complied with. 
                  Encouraged are buildings in this district that are a mix of uses including commercial, office, and residential uses. Mixed-use buildings may include retail service or office uses on the bottom floor, with upper floors used for office or residential uses. 
                  502-4 Architecture and building materials. 
                  1.  The modification of existing buildings shall conform to the existing historic and landmark architecture of Lilburn. New development should preserve and maintain the scale and character of the area with architectural forms compatible with the buildings in the surrounding area. 
                  2.  The style and building materials used in new or renovated buildings should echo the character of the commercial and residential structures developed in the area during the time surrounding the turn of the 20th century: 1880s through 1920s. The character of this time period was identified by the community as the look they wanted to be expanded or introduced throughout the Town Center area. New buildings respect the existing traditions without copying them. 
                  3.  All exterior wall materials of dwellings within infill residential development projects shall consist of brick masonry, stone, masonry, wood clapboards, fiber cement, or weather boarding, and appropriate architectural accents as approved by the director as a part of site design and architectural review. Standing-seam or corrugated metal walls or vinyl siding shall not be permitted on any façade or building wall. Architectural treatments shall occur on all four sides of the building. Roof materials shall be asphalt composition, wood shake, tile, or standing seam metal. 
                  502-5 Additional design criteria for approval. The following design criteria will be considered by the department in the review of applications for development projects within the Town Center Overlay District: 
                  1.  Connectivity. Infill should achieve connectivity between on-site and off-site transportation systems, streetscapes, and open space networks. Sidewalks need to be provided which connect to the existing or planned adjacent sidewalk system, and streets need to connect to the adjacent existing or planned street pattern. 
                  2.  Circulation. If the infill development is large enough, new street systems should be laid out as an interconnected network and designed to meet the needs of bicyclists, strollers, wheelchairs, pedestrians, and motor vehicles. 
                  3.  Alley garages. Garages accessed by alleys can enhance the design and function of infill projects and therefore should be considered and implemented as appropriate. 
                  502-6 Site design and building orientation. To assure that development and redevelopment within the Town Center District is consistent with the goals of this article, in addition to development regulations provided by City Code, the following is required prior to the issuance of development and building permits by the city.

                  ARTICLE 8. - ACCESS, PARKING AND LOADING 

                  Section 801. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The purposes of this article are summarized as follows: 
                  1.  Establish requirements for multi-modal access to development sites, including vehicular, truck service, and pedestrian, as appropriate; 
                  2.  Establish on-site circulation patterns conducive to safe pedestrian as well as vehicular and truck access; 
                  3.  Establish minimum off-street parking and loading areas in proportion to the need created by each use, but considering reductions for the provision of alternative modes of travel; 
                  4.  Reduce congestion in the streets and ensure that uses and functions of public rights-of-ways are not interrupted; 
                  5.  Establish certain maximum as well as minimum requirements for parking spaces to reduce development costs and ensure that excess impervious surfaces are not constructed, while providing for exceeding maximums when a demonstrated need exists. 
                  6.  Promote flexible approaches to the provision of off-street parking, including in some cases, as appropriate, use of on-street parking, shared parking arrangements, and smaller spaces for compact cars; 
                  7.  Establish design and improvement specifications for the development of parking lots, loading areas, access aisles, and connections of parking lots to public streets; 
                  8.  Ensure that parking areas will be compatible with abutting residential zoning districts. 
                  Section 802. - Applicability. 
                  Except within the TC Overlay District and as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, this article shall apply to: 
                  1.  New commercial, office, industrial, and residential construction; and 
                  2.  For new uses or conversions of existing, conforming buildings; and 
                  3.  For enlargements of existing structures; and 
                  4.  When the occupancy of any building is changed to another use. 
                  This article shall not be construed so as to require additional parking spaces to be furnished for an existing building which is repaired, altered, maintained, or modernized, where no structural alterations are made and the size of the building is not increased. 
                  Section 803. - Access. 
                  1.  The entire parcel, rather than simply a particular project, shall be considered in formulating and approving access plans. 
                  2.  All parking shall be provided with vehicular access to a street. Parking areas shall not thereafter be encroached upon or altered without approval of the director. 
                  3.  Loading areas shall be provided with access to a street or alley. Loading areas shall not thereafter be encroached upon or altered without approval of the director. 
                  4.  Off-street parking and loading spaces shall have access so that their use will not require backing movements or other maneuvering within a street right-of-way. 
                  5.  There shall be no obstruction of a public sidewalk, including that portion of the sidewalk within a driveway apron, due to parking, loading, or other activity. The director may require that construction contractors make special provisions for maintaining safe passage along public sidewalks during construction. 
                  Section 804. - Shared driveways and interparcel access. 
                  1.  Applicability. This section shall apply to all new office, commercial, institutional, and industrial developments and major building renovations and repaving projects of office, commercial, institutional, and industrial developments. 
                  2.  Shared driveways. Shared driveways between two parcels along the common property line may be required during subdivision plat review and/or site and design plan approval. In such cases, the subdivider and/or each property owner shall grant an access easement to facilitate the movement of motor vehicles and pedestrians across the site. 
                  3.  Interparcel access requirements. Interparcel access for vehicles between abutting properties shall be provided as an alternative to forcing all movement onto abutting highways and public roads unless the director determines that it is unnecessary to provide interparcel access due to the unlikelihood of patrons traveling among abutting sites or physical challenges occur. Where opportunities for shared access have been identified by the director, developments must provide shared access with adjoining properties to facilitate frontage roads and/or driveway connections between parcels. The property owner shall grant an access easement to facilitate the movement of motor vehicles and pedestrians from site to site. 
                  4.  Locations. The location of vehicular connections across a property line shall be mutually determined and constructed by both property owners. Connection of parking areas for vehicular access shall be provided in the rear portion of the site, as approved by the director. In cases where it is not possible to provide the connection in the rear, it may be provided in the front portion of the site. In the case of coordination problems or any factors preventing construction of an interparcel connection, the director will determine the location of the interparcel connection to be constructed by property owners. 
                  Section 805. - Visibility at intersections and driveways. 
                  No fence, wall, sign, hedge or planting or any similar improvement will be permitted to obstruct the sight lines or visibility of motorists and/or pedestrians at any intersection of public or private streets or at any driveway intersection with a public or private street. For purposes of this section, obstructions shall be defined in terms of height as elevations between 30 inches and 12 feet above any roadway or driveway, as applicable. 

                  Unless otherwise specified by the director, the area regulated shall be two triangular areas formed by the street right-of-way lines, or such lines extended, and lines connecting such right-of-way lines at points 25 feet from the intersections of the right-of-way lines. 
                  Section 806. - Internal vehicular circulation. 
                  1.  Efficient and easily recognized vehicular circulation routes within a development are vital and shall be provided. 
                  2.  Internal vehicle circulation shall be designed or redesigned in a manner that avoids conflicts between through-traffic (i.e., traffic flowing into and out of the site) and local traffic (i.e., traffic through parking areas). 
                  3.  Interior vehicular circulation shall be provided by: visually orienting the driver with a regular, logical system of interior driveways and roadways; identifying entrance drives with small entry signs; and preventing vehicles from driving across or through designated parking areas by placing raised landscaped dividers or walkways between parking aisles. 
                  Section 807. - Pedestrian facilities internal to site required. 
                  1.  Required. Internal to each building site, any new development unless exempted from this section shall provide safe routes of pedestrian access between points of departure and destinations in the form of an internal sidewalk system. Pedestrian access must be provided to individual developments and each establishment within the development. When multiple buildings are proposed on an individual site, they shall be linked with on-site pedestrian walkways. 
                  2.  Connections. The internal sidewalk system shall connect to the public sidewalk system along streets and highways, where it exists or is planned, or where required by the director via site and design plan approval. The internal sidewalk system shall also connect to any sidewalk systems on abutting private properties or provide for such connections in their absence. 
                  3.  Design. Pedestrian ways shall be well defined and take the most direct path possible. The director through site and design review may require that automobile access ways be separated from pedestrian access ways. Pedestrians shall have the right-of-way over automobile travel within interior portions of development sites. 
                  4.  Crossings. On any particular development site subject to this section where pedestrian circulation crosses vehicular routes, a change in grade, materials, textures, or colors, or appropriate striping or demarcation, shall be provided to emphasize the point of intersection between pedestrians and vehicles and improve its visibility and safety. For instance, brick pavers and other special paving materials can help to distinguish pedestrian walkway surfaces from vehicular access ways. 
                  5.  Width specifications. All walkways internal to the site shall be a minimum of five feet wide, except for walkways serving individual single-family residences which shall be a minimum of four feet wide. 
                  6.  Applicability and exemption. This section shall not apply to construction of any detached, single-family residence on an individual lot, but it shall apply to any lot that is contained within a final subdivision plat approved and to any lots that are a part of a larger development which received site and design plan approval and which required sidewalks internal to each single-family lot. 
                  Section 808. - Off-street parking required. 
                  Off-street automobile parking spaces shall be provided on every lot on which any building, structure, or use is hereafter established in all zoning districts, except for the Town Center Overlay District (where some flexibility is provided; see parking requirements for that specific district). Required parking spaces shall be available for the temporary parking of passenger vehicles for residents, customers, patrons, and employees, as appropriate given the subject use. 
                  Section 809. - Location of off-street parking areas. 
                  1.  Requirement. All parking spaces required by this article shall be provided on the same lot with the main building or use which it serves, except as specifically provided in this section or as otherwise provided in the Town Center Overlay District. 
                  2.  Exemption. The director may permit some or all of the required parking spaces to be provided on another lot, a substantial portion of which must be within 800 feet of such building, structure, or use. Any applicant proposing to use off-street parking on another site to meet the on-site parking requirements of this article shall submit evidence either of ownership or a valid agreement for use of the parking area off-site. Safe and convenient pedestrian access, such as a sidewalk or path, must exist or be provided from the structure or use to the off-site parking lot. 
                  Section 810. - Parking plan required. 
                  1.  Before any parking lot or other parking improvement is constructed, or building permit is issued, the parking lot layout and area must be found by the director to be in compliance with all requirements of this article and a parking plan must be approved by the director via the site and design plan approval process. 
                  2.  No permit shall be issued for any parking area until the plans and specifications have been submitted for review by the director and site and design plan approval has been given by the director. Such plans and specifications shall include the number of spaces provided and required, the location of entrances, exits, aisles, curbing where required, landscaping, screening, surface materials, and provisions for drainage. 
                  3.  Occupancy or use of a building shall not be allowed until parking facilities meet the requirements of this article. 
                  Section 811. - Minimum design requirements. 
                  The following minimum design requirements shall be adhered to and demonstrated with the submission of appropriate plans and specifications during the site plan approval process: 
                  1.  Paving surfaces. In any commercial district, parking and loading areas shall be paved with concrete, asphaltic concrete, asphalt, or brick pavers in commercial areas. 
                  In the IA district, parking and storage lots may be on contained gravel surfaces. Containment shall retain the gravel so it is restrained from moving into sidewalks, streets, and other public areas. 
                  In any residential district, the parking of any vehicle shall be on a concrete, asphalt, brick paver, or decorative stone surface. The use of decorative stone as a parking surface shall be contained within a confining border. Not more than 35 percent of the front yard shall be use for parking under any circumstances. 
                  2.  Pervious surfaces. Pervious pavement parking spaces and grass pavers may be substituted for standard dust free pavements. Aggregate (gravel) surface is not considered a decorative stone, but may be considered appropriate for certain uses at the discretion of the Director. Water quality considerations and the character of the district in which the parking lot is proposed to be constructed may be considered by the Director in modifying parking lot pavement requirements during the required site plan approval process. 
                  3.  Curbing and drainage. Parking and loading areas shall be properly graded, but in all cases drained so as to prevent damage to abutting properties or public streets. Water quality effectiveness and character of the zoning district shall be considerations in determining curbing requirements by the director via the site plan approval process. 
                  4.  Circulation. Dead-end parking areas shall be prohibited unless design conditions prevent a connected design, and they can only be used if 90 degree parking design is used. 
                  5.  Minimum parking space sizes. Off-street parking spaces shall be a minimum of nine feet in width by 18 feet in length. Compact parking spaces shall measure eight feet by 16 feet. 
                  6.  Minimum aisle width. Parking driveway maneuvering aisle width requirements vary according to the width and length of parking spaces and the angle of parking. For a single row of 90 degree head-in parking, the minimum depth for a parking space plus the width of the aisle shall be 42 feet. For two rows of 90 degree head-in parking using the same aisle, the minimum depth for parking spaces plus the width of the aisle shall be 60 feet for nine-foot wide spaces (measured from back of curb to back of curb). 
                  The director may authorize parking lot designs that utilize 75, 60, and 45 degree-angled parking spaces with one-way or two-way aisles. If such angled parking is used, parking lots shall comply with acceptable parking dimensional standards for aisle widths as specified by the Institute of Transportation Engineers or other reputable source approved by the director. 
                  Parking aisle length shall not exceed 500 feet without a break for circulation. 
                  7.  Compact auto parking. Compact parking spaces may be used in parking areas when more than 20 parking spaces are required, provided that the areas for compact parking are clearly marked and not more than 20 percent of the number of parking spaces provided in the entire parking area is designated compact auto parking. 
                  8.  Landscaped divider. One landscaped divider (planted area within in between and separating the vehicle parking spaces fronting one another) with a minimum width of nine feet shall be provided for every fifth parking aisle in a parking lot; provided, however, that the director may vary this requirement via the site plan approval process in cases of short parking aisles or where alternative designs prevent random maneuvers which can endanger pedestrians. 
                  9.  Lighting. Parking areas shall be appropriately lighted unless the director via site and design plan approval determines that lighting would be incompatible with abutting properties. Where lighting of parking lots is required or provided, light poles should be located in landscaped planter strips. Where this cannot be accomplished, light poles must be placed on a reinforced concrete pedestal to protect them from damage or being knocked over. 
                  10.  Landscaping. Parking lots shall meet the requirements for parking lot landscaping as specified in the buffer, landscape and tree ordinance. 
                  11.  Signage. Where needed to promote proper circulation within off-street parking areas, directional signs shall be placed in appropriate locations as specified by the director via site and design plan approval, development permit approval, or parking plan approval.

                  Section 812. - Minimum and maximum on-site parking spaces. 
                  1.  Unless specifically provided otherwise in this article, on each lot where a building, structure, or use exists, each site shall be designed to provide and shall provide for off-street parking in the minimum (and not to exceed the maximum) amounts in Table 8.1. 
                  2.  No existing or future off-street parking area shall be reduced in capacity to less than the minimum required number of spaces, or increased to more than the maximum permitted number of spaces, or altered in design or function to less than the minimum standards, unless specifically provided for in this article. 
                  3.  This section shall not be construed as requiring compliance of parking lots which lawfully existed on the effective date of this article; provided, however, that the director shall ensure parking lots that do not comply with this article meet the requirements of this article or substantially comply when a new development permit is required or a building permit is required to add additional building space on the site. If substantial redesign of the parking lot is required to comply with this article in such cases of new development or building additions, the director may accept substantial rather than complete compliance when the strict application of a requirement of this article would pose substantial practical difficulty. 
                  Unless otherwise noted, the parking requirement shall be based on the gross square footage of the building or buildings devoted to the particular use specified.

                  Section 813. - Interpretations. 
                  1.  Fractions. Where a fractional space results during the calculation of required parking, the required number of parking spaces shall be construed to be the next highest whole number. 
                  2.  Parking space requirement not specified. Where the parking requirement for a particular use is not described in Table 8.1, and where no similar use is listed, the director shall determine the number of spaces to be provided based on requirements for similar uses, location of the proposed use, the number of employees on the largest shift, total square footage, potential customer use, and other expected demand and traffic generated by the proposed use. At the discretion of a development applicant, a parking generation study prepared by a qualified professional may be submitted to aid the director in making such a determination; if submitted, it shall be considered by the director prior to making a determination. 
                  3.  Computations for multiple floor uses within a building. In cases where a building contains some combination of residential use, office space, retail or wholesale sales area, and/or bulk storage area, the director may authorize that the building space be divided into such floor space use areas and separate computations of floor areas (e.g., warehousing, retail, and/or office) in determining the off-street parking or loading space requirements of this article. 
                  Section 814. - Number of handicapped parking spaces required. 
                  Regulations and dimensions for handicapped parking spaces shall be per requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (Public Law 101-136) and the Georgia Accessibility Code. 
                  Section 815. - Reduction for off-site, off-street arrangements. 
                  As provided in this article, off-site, off-street parking may be used in combination to meet minimum parking space requirements; a reduction of required on-site, off-street parking spaces on a given site may be permitted by the director in cases where additional off-street, off-site, parking area in sufficient quantity and availability in conformity with this article compensates for the reduction. 
                  Section 816. - Reduction for mixed or joint use of parking spaces. 
                  When more than one use is provided on a lot, and such uses operate more or less simultaneously, the total requirements for off-street parking spaces shall be the sum of the requirements for the various uses computed separately. The director may authorize a reduction in the total number of required off-street parking spaces for two or more uses jointly providing parking facilities when their respective hours of need of maximum parking do not normally overlap, provided that the developer submits sufficient data to demonstrate that the hours of maximum demand for parking at the respective uses do not normally overlap. The required spaces assigned to one use may not be assigned to another use at the same time, except that one-half of the parking spaces required for churches, theaters or assembly halls whose peak attendance will be at night or on Sundays may be assigned to a use which will be closed at night or on Sundays. 
                  Section 817. - Reduction for on-street parking. 
                  The director may in individual cases administratively authorize a reduction in the minimum number of parking spaces for projects that are served by on-street parking. 
                  Section 818. - Off-street loading required. 
                  On the same lot with every building, structure or part thereof, erected or occupied for manufacturing, storage, warehouse, truck freight terminal, department store, wholesale store, grocery supermarket, hotel, hospital, mortuary, dry cleaning plant, retail business, college, or other uses similarly involving the receipt or distribution of vehicles, materials or merchandise, there shall be provided and maintained adequate space for the standing, loading, and unloading of such materials to avoid undue interference with public use of streets, alleys, and private or public parking areas. 
                  This section shall not apply to uses permitted in the Town Center Overlay District. 
                  Section 819. - Loading area locations. 
                  Loading areas shall be located to the rear of the building unless the director determined via site and design review that the site design precludes a rear location. 
                  Section 820. - Loading area specifications. 
                  Unless otherwise approved by the director, loading spaces shall be a minimum of 14 feet wide, 40 feet long, with 14 feet of height clearance. When the development requires loading and unloading by full-size tractor-trailers, loading spaces shall be 60 feet long with a 63-foot apron. 
                  _____
                  Section 821. - Loading docks and spaces required. 
                  Unless otherwise approved by the director, when loading space is required by this article it shall be provided in the quantity according to land use specified in Table 8.2.

                  ARTICLE 9. - NONCONFORMITIES 

                  Section 901. - Nonconforming lot. 
                  A lot of record, as defined in this chapter, that does not conform to minimum road frontage requirement or the minimum lot size or minimum lot width requirements for the zoning district in which it is located may be used as a building site, provided that the height, buffer, setback, and other dimensional requirements of the zoning district in which the lot of record is located are complied with or a variance is obtained, and, provided further, that in the case of a lot not served by sanitary sewer the lot area and width meet the current standards and requirements of the Gwinnett County Health Department for septic tank use. 
                  Section 902. - Nonconforming building or structure. 
                  A nonconforming building or structure, as defined in this chapter, may be expanded, enlarged, or extended if such expansion, enlargement, or extension is for a use that conforms to the use requirements for the zoning district in which the building or structure is located. Any such expansion, enlargement, or extension of a nonconforming building or structure shall meet the minimum yard, setback, buffer, height, and other requirements for the zoning district in which said non-conforming building or structure is located, and all other requirements of this chapter. 
                  Section 903. - Nonconforming use. 
                  A nonconforming use may be continued even though such use does not conform with the use provisions of the zoning district in which said use is located, except as otherwise provided in this section. 
                  1.  Change of use. A nonconforming use shall not be changed to another nonconforming use. A change in tenancy or ownership shall not be considered a change to another nonconforming use, provided that the use itself remains unchanged. 
                  2.  Discontinuance or abandonment. A nonconforming use shall not be reestablished after discontinuance or abandonment for one year. Vacancy and/or non-use of the building, regardless of the intent of the owner or tenant, shall constitute discontinuance or abandonment under this subsection. If an occupation certificate is required for said nonconforming use and the occupation certificate has lapsed for more than six months, said lapse of occupation certificate shall constitute discontinuance. 
                  3.  Expansion. A nonconforming use shall not be expanded, enlarged or extended, in land area or in floor space or volume of space in a building or structure, except for a use which complies with the zoning district in which said use is located. 
                  4.  Repair. A nonconforming use shall not be rebuilt, altered or repaired after damage exceeding 50 percent of its replacement cost at the time of damage as determined by the Planning Department, except for a use which conforms with the zoning district in which said use is located, and provided such rebuilding, alteration or repair is substantially completed within one year of such damage.

                  Section 904. - Nonconforming sign. 
                  See the Lilburn Sign Ordinance for provisions regarding nonconforming signs. 
                  Section 905. - Prior nonconformities. 
                  Any nonconforming use shall be able to continue as a nonconforming use unless the use is brought into conformity with the adoption of this ordinance. 
                  Section 906. - Correction of nonconforming situations. 
                  1.  Intent. It is the intent of this section to require the complete correction of nonconforming situations at the time of any building addition or significant modification of a use or development on a given parcel of land, if such nonconforming situation can physically be made to comply with the requirements of this chapter. It is the intent of this section to require the reduction in the extent of nonconforming situations at the time of any building addition or significant modification of a use or development on a given parcel of land, if such nonconforming situation cannot be physically be made to comply entirely with the requirements of this chapter. It is the intent of this section to provide authority to the director to administer the provisions of this section in a manner that meets these intentions, and that the director shall exercise that authority, subject to more specific guidance as provided in this section. 
                  2.  Determination of nonconforming situations. For any proposed building or development, or modification of a building or development, it shall be the duty of the director to identify the extent to which the improvements on land on which the building or development is proposed constitutes a nonconforming situation, as defined in this chapter. The director shall conduct a review and identify such nonconforming situation(s) at the time plans for such proposed building or development are submitted for review, and at any earlier opportunity, if presented. In the event that one or more nonconforming situations are found to exist by the director, they shall be documented and notice of the need to correct or reduce said nonconforming situations shall be provided by the director to the building or development applicant. 
                  3.  Correction of nonconforming situations. In determining the need to completely correct or reduce the noncompliance of nonconforming situations, the director shall be guided by the following standards: 
                  (a)  Strict compliance. A standard of "strict compliance" (complete correction of all nonconforming situations) shall be applied by the director where physical standards can clearly be made in the subject development proposal without significant alteration of the development as proposed. 
                  (b)  Reasonable progress toward compliance. In cases where complete correction or compliance with the nonconforming situation would require undue hardship, practical difficulty, or might unreasonably reduce the size, scale, or other significant aspect of the development proposal, the director shall have authority to approve the building, development, or improvement even though it does not meet a standard of strict compliance, if the relief granted is the minimum necessary to effectuate the building, development, or improvement. 
                  (c)  Proportionality. Whenever something less than strict compliance is authorized by the director, in determining the amount or extent of compliance required, he shall apply a standard of "proportionality," meaning that the scope, scale, extent and cost of requirements to correct nonconforming situations are more or less the same as the scope, scale, extent and cost of the improvement or development proposed.

                  It is also the intent of this section to permit the filing of an application for variance simultaneously with a rezoning, special use permit, change in conditions of zoning or conditional use application, and have the concurrent variance and companion application(s) considered in the same cycle of review (i.e., "concurrent" variance application). However, no variance shall be approved prior to the City Council's final action.

                  a.  One member of the Zoning Board of Appeals may be member of the Planning Commission. 
                  b.  No other member of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall hold any elected public office in the City. 
                  2.  The term of office of each member of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be for one year.

                  2.  To authorize, upon appeal in specific cases, variances from the terms of the Zoning Resolution as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the Zoning Resolution will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of the Zoning Resolution shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justices done. Such variances may be granted in individual cases of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the Zoning Board of Appeals that: 
                  a.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions or practical difficulties pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography that are not applicable to other lands or structures in the same district. 
                  b.  A literal interpretation of the provisions of this Article would effectively deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties of the district in which the property is located, resulting in unnecessary hardship. 
                  c.  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved. 
                  d.  The special circumstances are not the result of any actions of the property owner. 
                  e.  Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the property of the applicant any special privileges that are denied to other properties of the district in which the applicant's property is located. 
                  f.  The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this Article and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or to the general welfare. 
                  g.  The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the proposed use of the land, building, or structure in the zoning district in which the development is located. 
                  3.  In exercising the above powers, the Zoning Board of Appeals may, in conformity with the provisions of this Resolution, reverse decisions or determinations from which the appeal is taken and, to that end, assume all the powers of the Director from whom the appeal is taken and may issue or revoke or direct the issuance or revocation of a Building or other permit. 
                  1005-4. Pre-application conference encouraged. Applicants for variances are encouraged, but not required to schedule an applicant orientation meeting with the Director.

                  1005-5. Separate applications required when more than one section is requested to be varied. A separate variance application, and a separate fee, shall be required for each individual section of this Article for which a variance is requested or from which relief is sought. 
                  1005-6. Regulations that cannot be varied. Variances shall not be granted to (a) minimum lot size requirements of a given zoning district; or (b) permit a use which is not permitted in the zoning district in pertaining to the subject property (i.e., a "use" variance). 
                  1005-7. Application. Applications for a variance shall require submittal of an application fee, application form, and supporting materials specified by this section in advance by the Director.

                  2.  Application form furnished by the Director, including signed and notarized signature of property owner;

                  4.  Boundary survey plat of the property; in the case where a building or structure was already constructed and requires a setback variance, the boundary survey shall include "as built" placement of the building or structure for which the setback is requested to be varied; 
                  5.  Letter of intent describing the regulations to be varied (specific sections and the amount of numerical variation sought), and including analysis of how the proposed development compares favorably with one or more of the criteria for granting variances as established in this section; 
                  6.  If pertaining to future development, a site plan of the property and proposed development shall be submitted at an appropriate engineering scale showing the proposed use and relevant information regarding the variance request.

                  2.  Not less than 15 days prior to the date of the public hearing, the City shall erect, in a conspicuous place on the property or in the right-of-way along the frontage of the property, a sign that shall contain information as to the Variance applied for, the date, time and place of hearing. 
                  3.  Failure to erect and maintain the sign as specified above shall not invalidate the subsequent determination of the Zoning Board of Appeals. 
                  1005-10. Zoning board of appeals public hearing and action. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing on the application as advertised and after review by the Director.

                  2.  In rendering a decision on any such application, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider all information supplied by the Director, any information submitted by the applicant, any information presented at the public hearing, and the extent to which the application meets the criteria specified for variance approval as prescribed in this section. 
                  3.  The Zoning Board of Appeals may approve or deny the application as proposed, or it may place conditions of approval on the application and approve the application with conditions.

                  1005-13. Appeals from decisions of the zoning board of appeals. Any person or persons severally or jointly aggrieved by any decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals may present an Appeal to the Gwinnet County Superior Court. 
                  1.  Such an Appeal to the Superior Court shall be the same as an Appeal to the Superior Court from any decision made by the Probate Court and as specified in the official Code of Georgia except, however, that the Appeal shall be filed within 30 days from the date of the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals. 
                  2.  Upon failure to file the appeal within 30 days, the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be final. 
                  3.  On Appeal, the case shall be heard by the Judge of the Superior Court of Gwinnett County without a jury unless one of the parties files a written demand for a jury trial within 30 days from the filing of the Appeal.

                  1.  The Director, or, in his absence or at his request, the Zoning Board of Appeals, shall have the power to grant variances (except for density and use variance) from the development standards of this ordinance where, in its opinion, the intent of the ordinance can be achieved and equal performance obtained by granting a variance. 
                  2.  The authority to grant administrative variances shall be limited to variances from the following requirements: 
                  a.  Front yard or yard adjacent to public street—Variance not to exceed the greater of 25 feet or 50 percent of the established minimum.

                  Section 1201. - Development permit. 
                  1.  Required. A development permit shall be required for any proposed use of land(s) or building(s), and before any improvement, grading or alteration of land(s) or building(s) commences to indicate and insure compliance with all provisions of this chapter and other applicable regulations in the City Code. Such development activities include, but are not limited to, clearing and grubbing, grading and/or land disturbance, and the construction of such improvements as streets, surface parking areas and drives, storm water drainage facilities, sidewalks, or other structures permanently placed on or in the property. 
                  2.  Separate requirements for phased applications. If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate development permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  3.  Exemptions. A development permit shall not be required for individual structures within approved subdivisions, nor shall a development permit be required for a detached, single-family dwelling on an individual lot not part of an approved subdivision or development. 
                  4.  Application. No person shall conduct any land-disturbing or development activity within the city without first applying for and obtaining a development permit from the director, if required, to perform such activity. 
                  5.  Application requirements. Applications shall be made in accordance with application requirements specified by the director and this section. All applications for a development permit shall be made to the director and shall be accompanied by the following: 
                  (a)  Application on the form furnished by the director. 
                  (b)  A fee as established by resolution of the city council. 
                  (c)  A copy of the approved preliminary plat, if subdivision is required and preliminary plat approval has been obtained, or an application for preliminary plat approval if required. 
                  (d)  A sufficient number (as approved by the director) of sets of plans drawn to scale, signed and stamped by one or more qualified professionals who have authority to produce such plans or portions thereof, with addresses and contact information. 
                  (e)  Plans requiring or involving stormwater management facilities shall require the submittal of plans containing information specified in the city's stormwater management ordinance. Approval of a development permit containing information and requirements of said article shall constitute approval of the permit required by that chapter. 
                  (f)  Plans involving land within a flood plain or flood hazard area shall require the submittal of plans containing information specified in the city's flood damage prevention ordinance. Approval of a development permit containing information and requirements of said article shall constitute approval of the permit required by that chapter. 
                  (g)  Plans requiring a land disturbance permit shall require the submittal of plans containing information specified in the city's environment ordinance unless specifically exempted by the director from the submission of plans in accordance with said Ordinance. Approval of a development permit containing information and requirements of said article shall constitute approval of the permit required by that chapter, subject to other applicable agency approvals required by said chapter. 
                  (h)  Plans involving land within a wetland shall require the submittal of plans containing information specified in the city's Wetlands Protection Ordinance. 
                  (i)  Plans shall demonstrate compliance as applicable with the city's tree ordinance as well as tree maintenance guidelines and standards as applicable. 
                  (j)  Development permit applications shall require the submission of plans and information specified in the city's subdivision and land development ordinance and shall demonstrate compliance therewith. 
                  The application shall be checked for completeness at the time of submission. Incomplete applications will not be processed and will be returned to the applicant. 
                  6.  Relationship to plat approval. An application for preliminary plat approval, when required by the City Code may be processed independently of, or in conjunction with, an application for issuance of a development permit. Applicants are cautioned, however, that the preliminary plat approval is discretionary with regard to compliance with the comprehensive plan and design requirements, and therefore, proceeding simultaneously with preliminary plan and development permit applications may result in the revision of engineering plans if the layout of the preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision must be modified. 
                  7.  Relationship to site and design plan review. It is anticipated and expected that applicants will proceed more or less simultaneously in pursuing site and design plan approval as required by Article 11 of this Zoning Ordinance; however, no development permit shall be approved until site and design plan review, if required, is accomplished. A development permit applicant, if not ready to submit architectural details for buildings or structures, may divide the site and design plan review application process into a "site" application and "building" application, and seek only the site plan portion of the approval process required by Article 11 of this chapter, which shall be required to issue a development permit. The applicant may defer the "building" part of the site and design plan approval process until after the approval and issuance of a development permit. 
                  8.  Agency and director review. The Director shall forward a copy of the Development Permit application, including the civil plans and drawings for the project, to other city departments or others as appropriate, for their review and comment. The applicant shall be required by the Director to secure development approval from other agencies if they are affected by (or have jurisdiction over) the development. Development approval may be required from, but is not necessarily limited to the following, as applicable: the city engineer, the city street and/or public works department, the soil and water conservation district with jurisdiction, the Gwinnett County Fire Department, the Gwinnett County Environmental Health Department, the Gwinnett County Planning and Development Department, the Gwinnett Department of Transportation, the Georgia Department of Transportation, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  9.  Consolidation and submission of comments to applicant. Upon receipt of comments from the city and all other departments and external agencies as appropriate, the Applicant shall submit revised plans to reflect all such comments related to compliance with applicable city regulations and agency requirements. 
                  10.  Issuance. All development permits shall be issued by the director who shall in no case grant any development permit for the use, construction or alteration of any land or building if the land or building as proposed to be used, constructed or altered would be in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter or other applicable regulations of the city. The applicant shall be responsible for compliance with all codes, regulations, and zoning requirements and for the satisfaction of all of the comments of reviewing city departments, external agencies, and the director. Although review may have been achieved, if another city department or external agency requires approval or a permit, the owner shall also be responsible for obtaining such approval or permit from all other agencies affected by the project prior to issuance of the development permit by the director. 
                  11.  Denial. If the development permit is denied, the director shall state in writing the reason for the denial and the applicant shall be notified of the denial. A record of all development permits shall be kept on file in the office of the director which shall be a public record. 
                  12.  Duration of validity. A development permit shall expire two years after its issuance, subject to the following provisions: if the work described in any development permit has not been begun within one year from the date of issuance thereof, said permit shall expire, and if work described in any development permit has not been substantially completed within two years of the date of issuance thereof, said permit shall expire. Application processes shall begin anew for any expired development permit. 
                  13.  Suspension or revocation. The development permit may be suspended or revoked by the city, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the permit, upon finding that the holder or his or her successor in title is not in compliance with the approved development permit or is in violation of any applicable regulations in the City Code.

                  Section 1203. - Certificate of occupancy.

                  3.  If the certificate of occupancy is denied, the building inspector shall state in writing the reason for the denial and the applicant shall be notified of the denial. A record of all certificates shall be kept on file in the office of the building inspector.

                  (3)  The "stub" street shall be fully designed as part of the Development Plans. However, the right-of-way shall only be cleared and rough graded in accordance with the approved plans, and all disturbed areas grassed. 
                  (4)  Connections for future extension of all public utilities shall be constructed as part of the subdivision. Curb returns shall be provided to the future "stub" street roadway location, and curb and gutter shall be installed across the roadway stub at the right-of-way line (extended). 
                  (5)  The right-of-way for the "stub" street shall be dedicated as part of the Final Plat. Slope easements or construction easements, if required by the street design, shall be shown on the Final Plat. 
                  6.3.6  Substandard Streets 
                  a.  In the event that a development has access to a substandard street (i.e., is a dirt or gravel road), the following improvements shall be required: 
                  (1)  If the abutting substandard street provides the primary means of access to the development and is dirt or gravel, the street shall be upgraded to a standard paved roadway from the end of the improvements required under a(2), below, to the nearest standard paved road along the route of primary access. 
                  (2)  Along the entire length of the property frontage where the access is other than primary, in addition to the road widening requirements of Section 6.3.3 or 6.3.4, as applicable, along the entire property frontage, a drainage swale ditch, shoulder, and adequate base shall be provided and the roadway paved on the opposite side of the road from the project, 12 feet from centerline to edge of pavement. 
                  b.  Off-site improvements required under a(2), above, shall, at a minimum, result in a full-section roadway meeting the requirements of a Local Residential Rural roadway (24 feet edge to edge of pavement, with drainage swale ditches as needed). Responsibilities shall be as follows: 
                  (1)  The Developer shall design the road and provide the labor, equipment, and materials required for roadway improvements and necessary drainage improvements. 
                  (2)  If the County desires the roadway to be improved to a standard greater than that for a Local Residential-Rural roadway, the County shall provide or pay the cost of the additional materials and labor. 
                  (3)  All right-of-way required for these off-site improvements shall be acquired by the County at the expense of the developer. 
                  6.3.7  Improvements Along State Highways 
                  For any development which abuts a state highway or other right-of-way controlled by the State of Georgia, improvements to the roadway and the location and design of any street or driveway providing access from the state highway shall comply with the standards and requirements of the Georgia Department of Transportation only when more restrictive than the requirements of these Regulations. A permit for the proposed access or improvements shall be required to have been approved by the Georgia D.O.T. and incorporated into the construction drawings for the project prior to issuance of a development permit by the Department. 
                  Sec. 6.4. - General Layout Requirements.

                  6.4.2  Local Streets and Minor Collectors 
                  Local streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. Minor collectors shall be provided to channel through traffic movements within a development, where appropriate to the design and a major thoroughfare is not proposed by the Comprehensive Plan. Minor collectors also may be provided as central routes within large residential subdivisions, where appropriate to the design, based on projected traffic demands exceeding 2000 trips per day (ADT). 
                  6.4.3  Cul-de-sac Streets 
                  a.  Dead end streets designed to have one end permanently closed shall provide a cul-de-sac turnaround and may be no more than 2000' in length. Additional length necessitated by topography or property configuration may be approved by the Director. 
                  b.  The length of a cul-de-sac street shall be measured from the center of the cul-de-sac to the center of the intersection with another street, whether a through street or another cul-de-sac or dead-end street. 
                  c.  Eyebrow cul-de-sacs (half cul-de-sacs) will be allowed only at "right-angled" intersections having an interior angle between 80 degrees and 100 degrees. 
                  d.  Cul-de-sacs shall conform to the layout and dimensional requirements as shown in the Standard Drawings. 
                  6.4.4  Other Dead End Streets 
                  a.  A dead end street shall be provided to the boundary of a subdivision where necessary to provide access to a land-locked abutting property, for planned continuity of future circulation, for improved access for public safety vehicles, or for the extension of public water or other utilities to neighboring lands. Such dead end streets shall be designed so as to allow their reasonable extension, and shall be located so as to be reasonably incorporated into a street design for the neighboring property. The stub street requirement may be waived by the Director, provided the Directors of the Departments of Public Safety and Public Utilities concur. 
                  b.  Dead end streets on abutting property shall be extended into a proposed subdivision and incorporated into the street design of the development. This requirement may be modified by the Director in cases of serious topographical hardship or dissimilar zoning which would create unacceptable land use conflicts between the two developments. This modification may be conditioned on the provision of easements necessary for the extension of public utilities, the provision of a cul-de-sac or other permanent turnaround on the dead end street, or the removal of the dead end street back to its nearest intersection. 
                  c.  Where a dead-end street (other than a cul-de-sac) serves more than three lots, the developer shall be required to provide a temporary vehicular turnaround within the right-of-way. This requirement may be waived if extension of the dead-end street is approved and under construction prior to its inclusion in a Final Plat. 
                  d.  Where a street dead ends at the property boundary and the street exceeds 1000' in length, a permanent cul-de-sac shall be required. In this situation, right-of-way to the property boundary shall be required, but the pavement shall not be extended to the property boundary beyond the edge of the paved cul-de-sac turnaround. In no case shall a dead end street exceed 2000' in length unless approved by the Department due to unusual topographic conditions or property configuration. 
                  6.4.5  Service Roads 
                  Where a development borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way, or limited access highway right-of-way or major thoroughfare, a public street may be required to be constructed and dedicated within the development approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way. 
                  6.4.6  Half-Streets 
                  Half-streets (new boundary streets having one-half of the minimum required right-of-way or pavement width) shall not be allowed nor access to same be permitted should it exist. 
                  6.4.7  Reserve Strips 
                  Land in private ownership adjacent to public rights-of-way which could control or are intended to control access to streets, alleys, or public lands shall not be permitted unless their control is given to the County under ownership, dedication, or easement conditions approved by the County Attorney or acceptable to the Director. No development shall be designed so as to deny access to abutting properties. 
                  6.4.8  Alleys 
                  Alleys shall not be provided except where the subdivider produces evidence satisfactory to the Director of the need for same. In the event the Director approves a design which proposes alleys, the alley shall be constructed as though it were a local street pursuant to the standards contained in these Regulations. 
                  6.4.9  Street Jogs 
                  a.  Street jogs shall either directly align or have offsets of a minimum of 125 feet for residential subdivision streets and a minimum of 200 feet for nonresidential subdivision streets, as measured between centerlines of said streets. 
                  b.  All major thoroughfares shall provide offsets as required by the Department, where alignment is not desirable or feasible, but in no case be spaced less than 600 feet apart as measured between centerlines of said streets. 
                  Sec. 6.5. - Traffic Control Devices. 
                  6.5.1  Traffic Control Signals

                  6.5.2  Street Name Signs 
                  Street name signs shall have a green background with white legends mounted on channelized posts. Alternate post material shall be subject to the review and approval of the Traffic Engineer. The posts and signs will be furnished and installed by the County at all street intersections. The developer (or homeowners association in the event an alternate signpost is chosen at a later date) shall pay the County's costs. 
                  6.5.3  Traffic Signals and Signs 
                  All traffic signals and signs shall conform to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (no decorative traffic control devices will be allowed). 
                  6.5.4  Striping Requirements 
                  All newly constructed streets having 4 or more lanes (including auxiliary lanes) and existing streets being widened with one or more additional lanes shall be striped or the payment of said striping costs shall be required from the Developer by the Engineering Department prior to the Approval of Development Conformance for the project. Striping shall be accomplished with paint meeting Georgia DOT standards conforming to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. 
                  6.5.5  Payment of Fees 
                  Payment for materials and installation of street name and traffic control signs in new developments shall be required by the Engineering Department prior to the Approval of Development Conformance. 
                  6.5.6  Street Lights

(Note: No blasting shall occur unless a permit has been obtained from the Fire Marshall's office.) Refer to the Standard Drawings for grading section and retaining wall details. 
                  8.1.6  While most soils in the area can be safely stabilized at a 2:1 slope, some soils exhibit a low shearing resistance and a low cohesiveness. These soils typically are micaceous silts and sandy soils with little or no clay. If the 2:1 slope shows evidence of shearing, non-cohesiveness, sliding, or inability to maintain compaction, the slope shall be stabilized at 3:1 or by using such mechanical methods as needed (such as retaining walls or "grow mats" stapled in place) to maintain slope, height, and integrity. 
                  8.1.7.  A grading plan showing building pad locations shall be submitted for residential subdivisions, unless a modification application is approved, zoned for a lot size of less than 12,000 square feet or a density of four units per acre or more. The intent of this regulation is to ensure adequate lot to lot drainage. Granting a modification will not nullify the intent of these regulations when the layout has a minimum lot area of 14,520 square feet and a minimum lot width of 90 feet. The grading plan may be used as a construction document prior to approval of the Final Plat or as a guidance document for individual lot grading after approval of the Final Plat.

                  Sec. 8.2. - Stormwater Management. 
                  8.2.1  Stormwater Management Report Required 
                  a.  Every project shall provide a Stormwater Management Report prepared by a Professional Engineer currently registered in the State of Georgia. The purpose of this report shall be to formulate a plan to manage stormwater runoff so that stormwater runoff hazards are not created and existing runoff-related problems are not exacerbated, either upstream or downstream from or within the boundaries of the property being developed. 
                  b.  The Storm Water Management Report shall identify the locations and quantities of storm water runoff entering and exiting the site for both pre- and post-developed conditions. Analysis of the off-site properties shall anticipate future development in addition to addressing existing conditions. 
                  All culverts, pipe systems, and open channel flow systems shall be sized based on all on-site upstream areas being developed in accordance with the development plans and the off-site upstream areas being fully developed in accordance with the Land Use Plan with no detention. Upstream detention may be included when determining flows, provided the engineer calculates the reduced flows by routing the developed flows through any storm water facility included in the analysis rather than assuming the reduction will occur. The engineer shall show that detention facilities used in the analysis will remain, be properly maintained and the storage volume and outlet structure is based on current conditions. 
                  Detention facilities shall be designed using pre-development flows based on existing conditions for all upstream areas including existing on-site lakes and detention. Post-development flows, except the 100-year flow, shall be based on on-site upstream areas being developed per the development plans and existing conditions for off-site upstream areas. The 100-year flow shall be based on on-site upstream areas being developed per the development plans and the off-site upstream areas being developed per the Land Use Plan with no detention. Upstream detention may be included if it meets the conditions as described for culverts and pipe systems. Existing conditions shall be defined as the conditions of the site at the time of application for a land disturbance permit. The existing condition includes on-site lakes and ponds. Pre-development flows shall be determined by routing the pre-development flows through these storm water facilities. Flows used to size the outlet structures for detention facilities that exceed the 25-year design flow, shall be sized as described for culverts and pipe systems. 
                  When more than 50 percent of the property of a developed project site is disturbed for either redevelopment or improvement, the Storm Water Management Report shall be prepared for the entire site and existing impervious areas shall be treated as forest in the pre-developed analysis. When 50 percent or less of the property is disturbed, detention shall be provided as required by these regulations for the disturbed area and existing impervious areas which are disturbed shall be treated as forest in the pre-developed analysis. 
                  The report shall contain drainage area delineation maps and other exhibits at satisfactory scale and sufficient in quantity and scope to define the boundaries of the site, and off-site areas, relative to watercourses, drainage divides, drainage structures, and other pertinent features. The County's Geographical Information System (GIS) mapping information shall be used where appropriate. 
                  c.  The analysis of downstream conditions in the report shall address each and every point or area along the project site's boundaries at which runoff will exit the property. The analysis shall focus on the portion of the drainageway "immediately" downstream from, the project. This area shall generally extend a flow distance of about one-half mile from the project's boundary line, but shall be longer for projects contributing relatively large amounts of runoff to the study area, and shorter for small runoff contributions. In all cases, the most critical downstream area investigation shall be conducted relative to existing and anticipated land uses on tracts which adjoin the project site. 
                  f.  When a development uses an existing facility where the last approved certification and record drawing of the facility was over 18 months prior to the new development's submittal, the engineer shall provide one of the following. 
                  1)  A new survey, drawing and certification showing that the outlet structure is constructed as approved and the flood storage and water quality volume of the facility is equal to or greater than the volume required when the facility was approved. 
                  2)  Construction plans and calculations showing that the outlet structure will function as designed and the flood storage and water quality volume of the facility will be equal to or greater than the volume required when the facility was approved once the proposed maintenance has been performed. 
                  3)  A new record survey, drawing, study and certification showing that the facility meets the development requirements when the facility was approved. 
                  g.  Design Criteria — General. 
                  All design related to storm water shall be in accordance with the Gwinnett County Storm Water Design Manual. 
                  h.  Evidence of Acquisition of Applicable Non-Local Permits 
                  The applicant shall certify and provide documentation that all other applicable environmental permits have been acquired for the site prior to approval of the Storm Water Management Report. 
                  (Ord. No. 113-04, 3-8-2004) 
                  8.2.2  Stormwater Detention Required 
                  a.  Whenever a Stormwater Management Report indicates that adverse stormwater runoff related impact is expected to result from the development of a property, that project shall be required to provide stormwater detention facilities such that peak flows from the developed site do not exceed those associated with predevelopment conditions. 
                  b.  The following criteria shall be evaluated by the Engineer preparing the Stormwater Management Report, and in determining whether or not detention should be required for any portion of any site: 
                  1.  Existing land uses downstream, 
                  2.  Anticipated future land uses downstream, 
                  3.  Magnitude of increase in peak flows due to development, 
                  4.  Presence of existing drainage problems, 
                  5.  Capacity of existing and anticipated drainage systems, 
                  6.  Creation of concentrated flows where none had occurred previously, 
                  7.  Availability of feasible locations for detention facilities, 
                  8.  Existing flows generated off-site which pass through the project site, 
                  9.  Anticipated future flows generated off-site which pass through the project site, and 
                  10.  The nature of the receiving watercourse. 
                  b. [c.]  Storm water detention facilities required in Subsection 8.2.2.a shall be provided, unless the authorized registered professional (refer to Subsection 8.2.1. Paragraph a.) certifies and provides certified documentation supporting the conclusion to the Director that at least one of the following is true and correct as applicable.: 
                  (1)  The non-detained, post-development runoff will leave the project site as sheet flow, and will not have an adverse impact upon downstream properties. The increase for a 25-year storm should not exceed one CFS over a length perpendicular to the flow of 100 feet. 
                  (2)  The effect of detention would be to concentrate flows where sheet flow had occurred under pre-developed conditions, and any impact of increase sheet flows upon downstream properties would be less adverse than that which would result from the concentrated flows from a detention facility even if energy dissipation devices were employed. 
                  (3)  The undetained flow will pass through downstream properties, in drainage easements obtained by the developer, to an existing detention facility that has been designed to manage the upstream property's runoff or to the point in the downstream analysis (see 8.2.1.c) which shows that detention is not required. 
                  (4)  Where the site runoff will flow directly into a stream or lake without crossing off-site properties: 
                  a.  24-hour detention of the one-year storm is required if water quality protection is required for the project. 
                  b.  Only peak detention for the two-year though the 25-year storm is not required if the downstream analysis using timing of the hydrographs shows no adverse impact from the exit of the site to the point immediately downstream from the project in the drainage basin where the project area is ten percent of the total drainage basin area. 
                  d.  In the event that the Professional Engineer has concluded that storm water detention may not be necessary as compliance with Section 8.2.2.c is anticipated, a pre-design conference with the Department shall be required before the submittal of plans. 
                  (Ord. No. 113-04, 3-8-2004) 
                  8.2.3  Detention design criteria — general 
                  a.  All stormwater detention design calculations shall be certified by a Professional Engineer currently registered in the State of Georgia. 
                  b.  All storm water detention facilities shall be designed to detain the one-year storm runoff for the area draining to the pond, for 24 hours. For the project, this volume, called the channel protection volume, shall be equal to or greater than the one-year storm runoff volume from the project. In addition, these facilities shall control the peak flow rates associated with storms having two-year, five-year, ten-year, and 25-year return frequencies so that flows from the developed site do not exceed those associated with predevelopment conditions at the project boundary nor increase the peak flows downstream from the project to the point in the drainage basin where the project area is ten percent of the total basin. Where adverse impacts, as defined in section 8.2.2.a, occur during the 100-year storm, the 100-year storm shall also be regulated. 
                  c.  A variety of methods of achieving stormwater management goals shall be acceptable in providing detention facilities. The type of facility provided shall be based on the following criteria: 
                  1.  The type of development for which the detention facility is being provided, 
                  2.  The type of development which the detention facility is intended to protect, 
                  3.  Volume of stormwater to be stored, 
                  4.  Origin and magnitude of the flows to be managed, 
                  5.  Topographic opportunities and limitations, 
                  6.  Safety considerations, 
                  7.  Maintenance requirements, 
                  8.  Aesthetic considerations, 
                  9.  Likelihood of facility operation interfering with access to public or private facilities, 
                  10.  Proximity of facility to property lines, utilities, buffers, etc., and 
                  11.  Similar site-specific constraints. 
                  d.  Detention facilities may be of any of the following types, and two or more types may be used in combination with one another: 
                  1.  Normally-dry basins, whether excavated or created by damming a natural drainage feature, or a combination of both methods, 
                  2.  Lakes and ponds, whether excavated or created by damming a natural drainage feature, or a combination of both methods, 
                  3.  Parking lot facilities, 
                  4.  Underground facilities, and 
                  5.  Roof top facilities. 
                  e.  Reservoir routing methods shall be used for all detention facility design. The size of the orifice to detain the one-year storm for the facility shall be computed using the following orifice equation with a 24-hour draw down time from the elevation of the total channel protection volume (CPV) and an orifice coefficient of 0.60. The minimum elevation of the two-year control shall be at the maximum routed pool elevation of the one-year storm and not pool elevation of the total one-year storm volume. 
                  h = head measured in feet from the elevation needed to store the total 1-year runoff volume (CPV) to the centroid of the orifice; 
                  Qa = average CPV outflow rate in CFS; 
                  Qa = CPV/3600 x 24; 
                  A = required orifice area in square feet; 
                  A = Qa/(0.6 x (64.4 x h/2) 0.5 ). 
                  f.  The detention methodology required for any given project shall conform to the following table. Although the various methods shown are authorized, it shall be the responsibility of the design Engineer to use the correct coefficients and applications which will result in compliance with the requirements of this Article and the intent of these Regulations. 
                  TABLE 8-A  DETENTION METHODOLOGY BY  DRAINAGE BASIN SIZE 

                   
                  1.  For the purpose of these Regulations, a drainage basin includes all of the acreage which will contribute flow to a study point (or area) along a downstream property line of the site being developed. 
                  2.  All sub-basins draining a project which fall within the same size category above should be analyzed using the same methodology. 
                  3.  Under no circumstances will the "bowstring" method be acceptable. 
                  g.  Runoff coefficients used for pre- and post-development conditions for the Rational Method shall be consistent with those shown in Table 9-F. For the SCS method the runoff Curve Numbers found in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" shall be used. 
                  h.  If either the Rational Method or the SCS Method is used for detention design, calculations shall be provided showing how all times of concentration or lag times were computed, both for pre- and post-developed conditions. Likewise, adequate support must be provided for all composite runoff coefficients or curve numbers used. 
                  i.  If a computer program is used for detention design, including generating and routing hydrographs, the output from the program shall be summarized in the Stormwater Management Report, and the same and version of the program shall be indicated. Computer output sheets may be attached to the report if desired by the design engineer or if requested by the Department. 
                  j.  The design of every detention facility of any type shall consider the effects both of inflows in excess of those the facility is designed to accommodate and of malfunctioning of the primary outlet system. A safe path for overflow condition flows shall be provided.

                  b.  Detention facilities, to the greatest extent feasible, shall be located so as to minimize the amount of flow generated on-site which by-passes the facility. 
                  c.  No portion of any detention facility shall disturb any required (as opposed to voluntary) buffer, landscape strip, or tree protection area. 
                  d.  The 100-year ponding limits of a detention facility shall not encroach upon a public right-of-way. 
                  e.  Detention facilities may be located within utility easements or rights-of-way, or encroach upon utility easements or rights-of-way, upon receipt by the Department of written permission from both the property and utility owners. 
                  f.  A detention facility may be located within or encroach upon a floodplain in accordance with the Floodplain Management Ordinance. 
                  g.  If a residential subdivision is provided with an on-site detention facility not located within a recreation area as specified in 8.2.4.g f. above, a mandatory property owners' association shall be established for its ownership and maintenance. The facility shall be located on a single lot within the development and owned by the property owners association. The lot shall have a minimum of 30 feet of public road frontage and a minimum lot width of 30 feet. If the project is provided with an off-site detention facility, a mandatory property owners' association shall be established for its maintenance. The association bylaws shall be recorded concurrently with the recording of a final subdivision plat. The association bylaws shall include the same provisions as specified in Subsection 5.9.2, Paragraph b. of this regulation.

                  b.  In a residential subdivision, it shall be the responsibility of the mandatory property owner's association to maintain the operational characteristics of any facility constructed on their property for storm water management pursuant to City requirements, to keep the access drive free of obstructions, and to maintain the facility free of obstruction, silt or debris. 
                  c.  In a non-residential subdivision or project served by a facility that provides storm water management for more than one property or by an off-site facility, the property owners shall enter into a maintenance agreement acceptable to the City for maintenance of the operational characteristics of the facility pursuant to City requirements, to keep the access drive free of obstructions, and to maintain the facility free of obstruction, silt or debris. 
                  d.  In a non-residential project with an on-site facility which serves only that project, the property owner shall be responsible to maintain the operational characteristics of the facility pursuant to City requirements, to keep the access drive free of obstructions, and to maintain the facility free of obstruction, silt or debris. 
                  e.  Where no maintenance agreement has been recorded, it shall be the responsibility of the property owner to maintain the operational characteristics of any facility constructed on their property for storm water management pursuant to City requirements, to keep the access drive free of obstructions, and to maintain the facility free of obstruction, silt or debris. 
                  f.  Prior to the issuance of a Development Permit, the owner shall submit a detailed schedule of long-term maintenance and inspection activities. This schedule of activities shall be incorporated into a maintenance agreement to be entered into between the City and the owner. The schedule shall describe all maintenance and inspection activities and the parties responsible. The maintenance agreement shall be in a form acceptable to the City and shall be recorded in the deed records of the Clerk of Superior Court of Gwinnett County.

                  8.2.7  Detention facility construction standards 
                  a.  Stormwater detention facilities shall be constructed in accordance with plans reviewed and approved by the Department, and shall be in place and inspected prior to the initiation of other improvements. If the detention facility is planned to be a lake, temporary detention facilities shall be provided and shall remain in place until such time as the lake has become effective in providing stormwater management. 
                  b.  Within a detention basin, all stumps are to be cut flush with the ground or removed and all debris is to be removed below a 1.2" rainfall event ponding elevation. Trees or shrubs may be allowed to remain below this ponding elevation only upon certification of the survivability of the vegetation.

The fence shall be contained with an easement at least 20 feet wide, shall not encroach upon the detention facility (although their easements may overlap by up to ten feet), and shall comply with the locational requirements of the Zoning Resolution. 
                  e.  The side slope in graded areas is recommended to be 3H: 1V or flatter. The normal ponding surface elevation shall be defined as the elevation when the volume contained in the facility equals the runoff from a 1.2" rainfall event. When the depth to the normal ponding surface is greater than 4 feet and the side slope is steeper than 4H:1V, a bench shall be provided. The bench shall be at least ten feet in width and is recommended to be 15 feet in width. The slope of the bench shall be 10H:1V. The bench shall be located so that the normal ponding surface elevation is between the top and bottom edge of the bench. See Storm Water Standard Drawing.

                  8.2.8  Detention Facility Certification and Record Drawings 
                  a)  When a new facility is constructed in a development, a certified record survey of each detention facility shall be prepared by a land surveyor currently registered in the State of Georgia. A certified record drawing of the facility shall be prepared based upon this survey. Based on the actual parameters established on the record drawing, an addendum to the Storm Water Management Report shall be prepared which demonstrates that the facility, as constructed, complies with the requirements of these Regulations. The amended Storm Water Management Report shall be certified by the authorized registered professional (refer to Subsection 8.2.1. Paragraph a.). The survey shall be performed after substantial completion and stabilization of the project has occurred. The record drawing and addendum to the Storm Water Management Report shall be submitted to the City at least one week prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy or Final Plat approval (as appropriate to the project). 
                  b)  When a development uses an existing facility without an existing storm water maintenance bond, the facility shall be cleaned out if necessary and a new record survey, drawing and certification showing that the outlet structure exists as approved and the flood storage and water quality volume of the facility is equal to or greater that the volume required when the facility was approved. As an alternative, a new record survey, drawing, study and certification showing that the facility meets the development requirements when the facility was approved shall be submitted. The survey shall be performed after substantial completion and stabilization of the project has occurred. The certification and supporting data shall be submitted to the City at least one week prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy or Final Plat approval (as appropriate to the project).

                  b.  Pipes that do not carry live streams shall extend at least 50 feet beyond the front building setback lines, and may be required to extend farther where necessary to provide an adequately protected building site on the property. In nonresidential subdivisions, these pipes may temporarily end at the right-of-way line, but shall be extended as part of a subsequent development permit approved for the individual site. 
                  8.3.9  Pipe Installation 
                  Reinforced concrete pipe shall be installed in accordance with Section 550 of the Georgia DOT Standard Specifications, Construction of Road and Bridges. Prior to approval of a Final Plat, the City may require the submittal of certification from a mandrel testing agency indicating that all installed pipe does not exceed 5% deflection. Based on field inspections, video surveillance may be conducted by the City or required by the City on storm drain installations before approval of the Final Plat or issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy. If required, video surveillance should be done after completion of all activities that may damage the pipe but prior to placement of base, paving or landscaping over or near the pipe. If video surveillance indicates problems such as pipe deformation, cracking or joint separation, the pipe shall be removed and replaced before approval. 
                  a.  Bedding: 
                  All pipe structures shall be placed on stable earth or fine granular foundation, the characteristics of which would be expected to provide long-term stability. In all live stream pipe installations, in areas of low bearing solid or non-uniform foundations, in area where rock is encountered at the foundation level, or in other locations where conditions warrant, a minimum of six inches of crushed stone bedding is required, (maximum size of stone shall be three-fourths inch). Geotextiles or geogrids may also be required by the City in problem areas.

                  Sec. 8.4. - Surface Drainage. 
                  8.4.1  Design Standards 
                  a.  All new proposed channels shall be designed to carry at least the ten-year storm with one foot of freeboard. 
                  b.  Transition channels shall be provided at the inlet and outlet ends of all culverts and pipe systems, unless otherwise provided herein. 
                  c.  The maximum flow velocity at the project site's downstream property line shall not exceed the predeveloped velocity. 
                  d.  In cases of potential erosion due to irregular channel alignment, extreme velocities, or excessive slopes, a paved ditch may be required. However, if, in the opinion of the Department, the expected long-term maintenance of a surface drainage system could prove impractical, a pipe design may be required. 
                  e.  The cross-sectional shape of channels shall be as found in the Standard Drawings. "V" shaped cross-sections are not permitted in grassed channels. 
                  f.  If the channel will be affected by backwater from culverts, bridges, other structures or floodplains, backwater curves shall be shown in profiles of the channel.

                  Sec. 8.5. - Erosion Control. 
                  8.5.1  Design Standards 
                  a.  The procedures and requirements of the Gwinnett County Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Ordinance, as may be revised from time to time, shall be applicable whenever any land disturbance is proposed to occur, and shall continue to apply until the project has been completed. In those instances wherein these Regulations are silent, the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" shall apply. 
                  b.  No permit shall be issued authorizing any land disturbing activity unless erosion and sediment control plans have first been submitted to and approved by the Department in accordance with these Regulations. 
                  8.5.2  Construction Standards 
                  a.  All erosion control structures and/or appurtenances as shown on the approved plans shall be in place and operational, inspected and approved by the Department, prior to the beginning of construction, and shall be maintained in operational condition until the phase or project has been completed. (See also requirements for initiation of development activities under Article 11.4.) 
                  b.  Temporary and permanent ground covers are required. 
                  c.  Upon project completion, erosion control devices and temporary siltation facilities shall be maintained in place while the individual lots are being developed, or until all disturbed areas are fully stabilized. 
                  d.  Erosion controls and siltation facilities shall be installed and maintained on each building lot during building construction and site development, as required by the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Ordinance and consistent with the provisions of the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia". 
                  8.5.3  Abandoned Projects 
                  Any project whose permit has lapsed under the terms expressed in Article 4, shall immediately proceed to stabilize all disturbed areas. This responsibility shall fall upon the owner, developer, contractor, or any and all other responsible parties involved in the land disturbance activity. 
                  Sec. 8.7. - Extended Detention. 
                  8.7.1.  Wet Extended Detention Facility Design Requirements. 
                  Wet extended detention facilities shall be designed and constructed to meet the following requirements: 
                  a.  Minimum and Maximum Drainage Area. 
                  The minimum drainage area for a wet detention facility should be at least 20 acres. The maximum drainage area should be 100 to 300 acres. The maximum drainage area of highly impervious drainage areas should be restricted to the lower end of the range (100 acres) and low-density residential watersheds should be restricted to a maximum of 300 acres. 
                  b.  Storage Volume of Permanent Pool. 
                  The permanent pool storage (VB) shall be at least 50 percent of the Water Quality Volume (WQV) defined in section 8.9.1. The part of the WQV (50 percent or less) not used in the permanent pool shall be detained for 24 hours and the storage volume may be used as part of the detention requirements. The WQV to be stored shall be based upon the project area. The project area compensated for in a pond shall not exceed the total drainage area draining to the pond. Off-site areas that do not drain through other water quality BMP's may be used to compensate for areas that by-pass the pond. By-passed areas shall be minimized as much as practical. Off-site areas exceeding the project site area may bypass the pond. 
                  Substitute a new "Wet Pond Diagram," below, for the existing figure: 
                  (Ord. No. 113-04, 3-8-2004) 
                  c.  Depth of Permanent Pool. 
                  (1)  Mean Depth. 
                  The mean depth (Z) of the permanent pool shall be between three feet and seven feet and is calculated by dividing the permanent pool storage volume (Vb) by the surface area (As) (Z = Vb/As). 
                  (2)  Maximum Depth. 
                  The maximum depth of the permanent pool shall be no greater than 12 feet unless a modification is approved. The intent of these regulations is to ensure that the depth of the facility is not out of proportion with the surface area of the facility. Granting of a modification will not nullify these regulations when the depth and surface area of the facility is based on existing natural topography. 
                  d.  Minimum Surface Area of Permanent Pool. 
                  The minimum surface area (As) of the permanent pool should be 0.25 acres. The minimum ratio of surface area to drainage area used to calculate the permanent pool (Aw) in residential watersheds shall be 1 percent unless a modification is approved. The intent of these regulations is to ensure that the depth is minimized to increase removal efficiencies. Granting of a modification will not nullify these regulations when the depth and surface area of the facility is based on existing natural topography. As/Aw ratios in excess of 3 percent are desirable for nonresidential watersheds with relatively high levels of imperviousness. 
                  e.  Side Slopes Along the Shoreline. 
                  (1)  The side slope in graded areas is recommended to be 3H:1V or flatter. When the depth of the permanent pool is greater than four feet and the slope is steeper than 4H:1V, a bench shall be provided. The bench shall be ten feet in width and is recommended to be 15 feet in width. The bench shall have a slope of 10H:1V. The bench shall be located so that the permanent pool elevation is between the top and bottom edge of the bench. See Storm Water Standard Drawing. 
                  (2)  Side slopes shall be topsoiled, nurtured or planted from two feet below to one foot above the permanent pool control elevation to promote wetland vegetative growth. Below the safety ledge, the pond side shall be sloped to meet topographic or volumetric constraints. 
                  f.  Length: Width Ratio of Permanent Pool. 
                  The minimum length: width ratio of the permanent pool shall be 2:1. The length shall be measured at the shortest flow path from the inlet to the outlet. The width shall be calculated as the surface of the pond divided by the length. In addition, the location of the outlet structure within the basin shall maximize travel time from the inlet to the outlet. Baffles or islands may be installed within the permanent pool to increase the flow path length and to minimize short-circuiting. 
                  g.  Soil Permeability. 
                  In cases where relatively permeable soils are encountered, water drawdown rates should be minimized by either compacting the permanent pool soils during construction, incorporating clay into the soil, or by installing an artificial liner. 
                  h.  Spillway and Dam Design. 
                  The principal spillway, emergency spillway, and dam shall be designed in accordance with Sections 8.2, 8.6 and 9.8 of these regulations. 
                  i.  Forebay 
                  (1)  To facilitate major cleanout activities, a sediment forebay shall be constructed near the inlet to the permanent pool to trap coarse sediment particles. The forebay volume may be included in the permanent pool volume requirements. The forebay storage capacity shall be ten percent of the water quality volume (WQV) defined in section 8.9.1. 
                  (2)  The facility shall be dredged to ensure that all of the permanent pool storage volume is available after the upstream area has been stabilized. All temporary sediment control measures employed during land disturbing activities to trap sediment shall be located outside of state waters. 
                  (3)  The forebay shall be distinguished from the permanent pool. Options which may be used include: a lateral sill with wetland vegetation; two ponds in series; differential pool depth; rock-filled gabions or a retaining wall; or a horizontal rock filter placed laterally across the permanent pool. 
                  j.  Inlet and Outlet Structures. 
                  (1)  The inlet design shall dissipate flow energy and diffuse the inflow plume where it enters the forebay or permanent pool. Options that may be used include: drop manholes; energy dissipaters at the bottom of paved ditches; a lateral bench with wetland vegetation; and the placement of large rock deflectors at each inlet. 
                  (2)  The outlet design shall consist of a riser with a hood or trash rack to prevent clogging and an adequate antivortex device for facilities serving large drainage areas. The outlet may be sized to achieve the flood control performance standards contained in Sections 8.2, 8.6 and 9.8 of these regulations. An emergency spillway shall be provided in accordance with Section 9.8.4 of these regulations. 
                  (3)  The channel that receives the discharge from the basin's outfall pipe shall be protected from erosive discharge velocities. Options which may be used include: rip-rap lining of the channel; or, the provision of stilling basins, check dams, rock deflectors or other devices to reduce outfall discharge velocities to non-erosive levels.

                  Sec. 9.1 - General. 
                  9.1.1  Purpose 
                  The Sections enumerated in this Article are guidelines, and are intended to be benchmark indicators of what standards could be acceptable. They are further intended to allow alternate designs which could produce results similar to these performance standards and similar protection to the public. The objective of these performance standards is not to suggest a single methodological standard of acceptance exclusive of all others. Rather they establish what would otherwise be allowed in the absence of an acceptable alternative. 
                  9.1.2  Constraints 
                  The alternative design solutions are constrained by the Design Requirements of Article 5, the Access Requirements and Street and Right-of-way Requirements and the Street Construction Standards of Article 6, and the Grading, Detention, Drainage Requirements of Article 8, as well as the Purpose and Intent of these Regulations. 
                  9.1.3  Documentation Required 
                  In the event that an alternative is suggested by the applicant, studies and reports conducted by professionals currently certified in the State of Georgia will be required to be submitted to and approved by the Department. These studies and reports must clearly relate to the desired results and purposes expressed or implied in the applicable performance standard. Once an alternative has been approved by the Department, it shall become a required standard applicable to the specific approved Permit only. 
                  Sec. 9.2 - Lots. 
                  9.2.1    
                  (a)  The City requires notation that a House Location Plan (HLP) is required to be approved prior to issuance of a building permit on all lots. 
                  (Res. of 5-12-1997) 
                  Lots should be designed generally such that they are no more than four times as deep as they are wide at the building setback line, unless excepted by the Director. 
                  (1)  A lot which presents particular or unusual difficulties for a builder to meet minimum required building setbacks; 
                  (2)  A lot upon which is located an easement of unusual configuration; 
                  (3)  A lot containing floodplain but upon which no fill or other encroachment into the floodplain is anticipated at the time the Final Plat is filed; 
                  (4)  A lot upon which is located all or a part of a storm water detention facility; 
                  (5)  A lot upon which is located a buffer which was required by the Zoning Resolution as a condition of zoning approval; 
                  (6)  All duplex lots; 
                  (7)  All lots within, or partially within, the Chattachoochee River Corridor, or containing a River Corridor Tributary Buffer Zone. 
                  b.  The Department may require notation that a Residential Drainage Plan (RDP) is required to be approved prior to issuance of a building permit on certain lots where additional (site specific) engineering will be necessary to properly grade the lot or locate the building or other improvements. Such lots include, but are not limited to: 
                  (1)  a lot containing floodplain where fill or other encroachment into the floodplain is planned or reasonably expected; 
                  (2)  a lot containing severe topographic features interdicting the building site; 
                  (3)  a lot containing a drainage easement with a pipe discharge or other facilities, or flow characteristics which may adversely affect the location of a building or other site improvements. 
                  c.  The Department may require notation that a Residential Drainage Study (RDS) is required to be approved prior to issuance of a building permit on certain lots where particular attention to site grading will be necessary, but formal engineering is not needed. Such an RDS is conducted in the field where the effect of the site grading must be accomplished with adequate care so as not to create a drainage problem on neighboring property. 
                  9.2.2  Side lot liens generally should be at right angles (90 degrees) to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines as much as practical. Side lot lines should be radial to the radius points of all cul-de-sacs. Variations of more than ten degrees shall require approval of the Department, but shall be approved when appropriate to the reasonable lotting pattern of the subdivision, efficient use of the land relative to topographic conditions, or provision of improved building sites over those which would result without variation of the side lot lines. 
                  9.2.3  Corner lots shall be sufficiently larger so that they have the same width between minimum side setback lines as an interior lot, but in no case shall more than 75 feet between side setback lines on a corner lot be required. 
                  Sec. 9.3. - Blocks. 
                  9.3.1  The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be determined with regard to: 
                  a.  Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated, 
                  b.  Applicable zoning requirements as to lot size and dimensions, 
                  c.  Needs for convenient access, circulation, control, and safety of street traffic, 
                  d.  Limitations and opportunities of topography. 
                  9.3.2  In blocks over 1,000 feet long, the Director may, when existing or proposed pedestrian circulation patterns or public gathering places so justify, require pedestrian ways or pedestrian access easements, as appropriate, through the block. 
                  Sec. 9.4. - Access. 
                  A maximum number of 200 residential dwelling units shall be allowed to be constructed with only one street outlet on an existing public street. If a second access to an existing public road is not available or, in the opinion of the Director, could induce non-residential traffic through the development, a single entrance may be allowed if designed with a traffic signal and/or sufficient right-of-way and improvements to provide a protected left-turn lane, subject to the approval of the Engineering Department. 
                  Sec. 9.5. - Roadway Design. 
                  9.5.1  Street Grades and Design Speeds 
                  a.  Minimum grade for all local and minor collector streets shall be 1.5%. Minimum grades for all major collector and arterial streets shall conform to Georgia D.O.T. practice. 
                  b.  Minimum grade of less than 1.5% on a local street may be approved by the Department, based on adequate engineering designs, where at least 1.5% cannot reasonably be achieved due to topographical limitations imposed by the land. In such cases, a Record Drawing and such computations as necessary shall be provided after construction to establish that the street will drain in accordance with these Regulations. Street sections where unacceptable pooling, excessive spread at catch basins, or other hazardous conditions occur shall be reconstructed or otherwise improved to eliminate such conditions. 
                  c.  Minimum vehicle design speeds and maximum grades allowable in Gwinnett County by street classification shall be as shown in Table 9-A. 
                  d.  Maximum grade on any cul-de-sac turnaround shall be 6%.

                  b.  Constant (K) values are shown in the Table 9-B for both desirable and minimum acceptable ("hardship") conditions. In all cases, the "desirable" value shall be used, unless it cannot be achieved due to topographic conditions beyond the developer's control. In such hardship situations, the Department may approve a lesser value to the extent required by the hardship situation, but in no event less than the value shown in the Table as "minimum."

                  R = minimum radius of curve v = vehicle design speed, (MPH) 
                  e = rate of superelevation 
                  v 2 (decimal of a foot rise per 
                  R = _____ foot of roadway width) 
                  15 (e + f) f = side friction factor,

                  Between reverse horizontal curves there shall be not less than the minimum centerline tangents shown in Table 9-D unless otherwise specified by the Georgia Department of Transportation. Compound radii curves are prohibited. At least the "desirable" length shall be provided unless hardship conditions of topography or property configuration will not allow lengths greater than those shown as "minimum." For compound circular curves, the ratio of the flatter radius to the sharper radius shall not exceed 1.5 to 1.

                  a.  New local streets which approach an intersection with a street in a category higher than itself on a horizontal curve having a centerline radius less than 240 feet shall provide a tangent section of roadway at least 30 feet long. Minor collectors approaching an intersection with a major thoroughfare on a horizontal curve having a centerline radius of less than 550 feet shall also provide the 30 foot tangent section. The tangent length shall be measured along the centerline of the street, from the right-of-way line of the intersecting street, extended, to the point of tangency with the centerline of the curve section. 
                  b.  New major thoroughfares shall provide tangent sections at intersections with streets in equal or higher categories as needed to provide adequate stopping distances at their design speeds. 
                  9.6.4  Intersection Approaches: Vertical Alignment 
                  a.  For intersections with local or minor collector streets, a leveling of the street at a grade not exceeding two percent shall be provided but no level approach distance is required for streets approaching at less than seven percent, and a minimum 25 foot level approach distance shall be provided for streets approaching at a grade of seven percent or more. (See Standard Drawings).

As an alternative, the minimum corner sight distance requirement may be calculated using AASHTO "Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets," Chapter 9 (at-grade intersections), latest edition. The sight distance shall provide clear visibility of an object four feet above the intersecting street viewed from the centerline of the driveway at the right-of-way line of the intersecting street, at a height of 3.5 feet above the ground. 
                  9.7.5  Separation, and Spacing 
                  All driveways except those serving residential units on individual lots shall be recommended to meet the following criteria: 
                  a.  Minimum separation from a street intersection: 100 feet from centerline of driveway to nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting street, extended. For any driveway on a major thoroughfare having a centerline between 100 feet and 200 feet from the intersecting street right-of-way line, access restrictions may be imposed to avoid traffic hazards. Greater separation may be required for safe operation of a free-right lane, acceleration or deceleration lane, etc. 
                  b.  Minimum separation between driveways along the same side of a major thoroughfare: 100 feet between centerlines as measured along the roadway edge or back of curb. 
                  c.  Whenever possible, proposed driveways along one side of a street shall coincide with existing or proposed driveways on the opposite side of such street. 
                  d.  Maximum number of driveways serving a single project: one for each 400 feet of property frontage, or fraction thereof per street, along a major thoroughfare. This is not meant to be a spacing standard only an expression of the total number of driveways that permitted serving a single project. 
                  Sec. 9.8. - Stormwater Detention Guidelines. 
                  9.8.1  General 
                  a.  Stormwater detention facilities shall be designed so that their peak release rates, when combined with those of all detention by-pass areas in the same basin, produce peak flowrates and flow velocities at the site's boundary line no greater than those which occurred at the same location for pre-developed conditions. 
                  b.  The positive effects of stormwater management via on-site detention facilities diminish rapidly as the distance downstream from the point of discharge increases, and the smaller the facility's contribution is, as a percentage of the total runoff contributing to downstream flow, the shorter the distance downstream that the benefits are realized. Because of these limitations, on-site detention is effective at controlling flooding only when flow from the facility is a significant percentage of the total flow at the point of interest, and only if the point of interest is "immediately" downstream. The concepts of "immediately downstream" and "significant percentage of total flow are inseparable. The portion of a receiving watercourse (one which receives and conveys runoff from a site) which lies within a flow distance of one-half mile (2,640 linear feet) downstream from the site, shall generally be considered to constitute that portion of the watercourse which is "immediately" downstream. However, the total flow in the receiving watercourse may become very large, relative to the flow contributed by the project site, within a much shorter distance. For this reason, the "substantial percentage" test must also always be applied. For purposes of the Regulations, the flow from a site represents a "significant percentage" of the total flow in a watercourse only when the ratio of the peak flow rate from the site to the peak flowrate in the watercourse (including the contribution from the project site) is greater than 5 percent. 
                  c.  Peak flowrate control shall normally be provided only for the two-year, ten-year, and 25-year frequency storm events. However, under certain conditions, the 100-year event must also be detained to the pre-developed rate. Such control of the 100-year event shall be provided when failure to do so would result in flooding of other habitable dwellings, property damage, or public access and/or utility interruption. 
                  d.  For any stormwater analysis, the composite "C" (Rational Method) or CN (SCS Method) used for analysis of pre-development conditions shall not exceed 0.25 or 60, respectively, unless prior approval has been obtained from the Department. A pre-design conference between the design engineer and appropriate Department personnel, which may in certain straightforward cases be conducted via the telephone, is required. 
                  e.  Rational Method runoff coefficients used for analysis of pre- and post-development conditions shall be consistent with those shown in Table 9-F. 
                  _____
                  TABLE 9-F  RATIONAL METHOD RUNOFF COEFFICIENTS 

                   
                  _____
                  9.8.2  Dam Design and Construction Criteria 
                  a.  Detention facilities which take the form of normally-dry basins, ponds, or lakes usually are created by damming a drainageway or watercourse. Such dams can take a variety of different forms, the most common being earthen embankments and reinforced concrete walls. Each type of dam has different characteristics, and the selection of the most appropriate type for a particular site should be made by a Professional Engineer and based on the physical features of the dam site, the purpose of the dam, the type of impoundment, safety, and maintenance requirements. 
                  b.  For purposes of these Regulations, dams will be addressed separately for each of the three most frequently encountered types of detention facilities: normally-dry basins, ponds, and lakes. A normally-dry basin is one designed to impound stormwater runoff for only a brief period of time following a storm event. The vast majority of the time the basin will be completely dry except for any normal stream flows which pass through unimpeded. Lakes and ponds, on the other hand, are designed to impound a body of water at least several feet in depth on a more-or-less permanent basis. Lakes and ponds vary from one another only in terms of magnitude. The magnitude of a lake is determined primarily from the height of its dam, the size of its contributing drainage area, and the volume of water it is capable of impounding. For purposes of these Regulations, a pond is any lake having a dam height of less than 20 feet, a drainage area of less than 100 acres, and which is incapable of impounding more than 10 acre-feet of water. 
                  c.  All dam design is to be certified by a Professional Engineer currently registered in the State of Georgia. 
                  d.  Dams for normally-dry detention basins shall conform to the following: 
                  1.  Dams for normally-dry detention basins may be constructed of earth, reinforced concrete, mortared rubble, or other suitable materials. 
                  2.  The design of any concrete or rubble wall over 5 feet in height shall be certified by a Structural Engineer currently registered as a Professional Engineer in the State of Georgia, and the structural design shall be based on soil tests certified by a Geotechnical Engineer currently registered as a Professional Engineer in the State of Georgia. 
                  3.  Any nonearthen structure shall be designed to prevent piping failure through its subgrade and abutments. 
                  4.  The construction of walls over five feet in height shall be monitored and approved by a qualified materials testing company. 
                  (5)  Earthen dams for normally dry detention basins shall have a top width of no less than 8 feet. 
                  6.  For Earthen dams for normally-dry detention basins, there shall be at least one and onf-half feet of vertical separation between the 100-year ponding elevation in the basin and the low point on the top of the dam. One foot of this distance is to provide a margin of safety against overtopping of the dam and the other six inches is to allow for settlement. No separation is required for a nonearthen dam, if it has been designed to overtop safely. 
                  7.  More stringent design and construction criteria shall be used for dams for normally-dry detention basins whenever the probable consequences of dam failure are severe. 
                  e.  Dams for ponds shall conform to the following 
                  1.  Any engineer responsible for the design of a dam for a pond is expected to be knowledgeable of the criteria contained within the Georgia Safe Dams Act, Georgia Department of Natural Resources "Rules for Dam Safety" publication, and the U.S.D.A. Soil Conservation Service's Technical Release No. 60 "Earth Dams and Reservoirs". The provisions of each are to be applied wherever applicable. Applicability shall be determined based upon site-specific constraints and downstream conditions. Consultation with appropriate Department personnel both prior to and throughout the design process is encouraged. 
                  f.  Dams for lakes shall conform to the following 
                  Any engineer responsible for the design of a dam for a lake is expected to be thoroughly familiar with the criteria contained within the Georgia Safe Dams Act, Georgia Department of Natural Resources "Rules for Dam Safety" publication, and the U.S.D.A. Soil Conservation Service's Technical Release No. 60 "Earth Dams and Reservoirs". All design is to be in accordance with the applicable requirements contained in each of the above referenced publications. 
                  (Ord. No. 055-02, 11-11-2002) 
                  9.8.3  Detention Facility Outlet Devices 
                  a.  Because of the variables that may be associated with the choice of an outlet device for any given condition, the design consultant is responsible for the selection of the device, subject to the review and approval of the Department. 
                  b.  The Department will include in its consideration the ease of maintenance, longevity of the system, freedom from congestion, practicality, and aesthetics in its review of the outlet device. The consultant should be guided by the Departmental preference of vertical weir designs since they have proven to generally meet most of the considerations expressed herein. 
                  c.  No orifice shall be smaller than 3 inches in diameter. An orifice smaller than 15 inches in diameter shall be protected by a trash rack. A trash rack protecting an orifice shall have a surface area of at least ten square feet. No opening in the trash rack shall have an area more than one-half the size of the area of the orifice being protected. Two-stage trash racks, or screens having progressively smaller openings placed in series, are suggested. To facilitate outlet operation, curved or inclined trash racks designed to allow debris to rise with the water level are preferred. In all cases, trash racks shall be either hinged or removable to facilitate maintenance operations. 
                  d.  If the primary detention facility outlet is a conduit through a dam, and there is not an orifice, weir-box, or other flow-control device affixed to the upstream end, then the conduit shall be analyzed for both inlet and outlet control conditions. If an orifice or weir-box is affixed, then the conduit shall be analyzed to determine if any flows will occur for which outlet control conditions in the conduit, rather than the hydraulic characteristics of the flow-control structure, will determine the total flows occurring. In any case where the conduit through the dam is less than 15 inches in diameter, the trash rack provisions of "c" above shall be followed. 
                  e.  Unless the 100-year maximum flow velocity in a conduit through a dam forming a pond or a lake is less than ten feet per second, and the hydraulic grade line for the 100-year condition is at or below the crown of the conduit for at least 90 percent of its length, the conduit must be equal or superior to Class V reinforced concrete pipe in it structural characteristics. 
                  9.8.4  Emergency Overflow Requirements 
                  a.  For every type of detention facility, a planned safe flowpath must be provided for conveyance of flows of water in excess of those for which the detention facility was designed. In many instances, this function can be provided through installation of an emergency spillway. Emergency spillways are usually excavated open channels, either vegetated or paved with reinforced concrete. 
                  b.  Every earthen dam shall be provided with an open-channel emergency spillway, unless all of the following apply: 
                  1.  The principal spillway is a closed conduit having a cross-sectional area that can pass 125 percent of the 100-year storm routed peak discharge. 
                  2.  The principal spillway is a closed conduit having a cross-sectional area of at least one square foot per each three acres of drainage area, or a maximum of twenty square feet of surface area, whichever is less. 
                  3.  The principal spillway capacity is at least equal to the capacity required for an open channel emergency spillway. 
                  4.  The low point of the dam crest is not in a fill section except for roadway embankments. 
                  5.  A trash rack or other debris protection is provided on the outlet control. 
                  c.  Any portion of any emergency spillway excavated into a dam embankment or other fill section must be paved. Pavement material shall be either reinforced concrete or asphalt, as dictated by the design life of the dam and the potential consequences of its failure. Any portion of any emergency spillway excavated into natural ground shall be vegetated in accordance with the practices described in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia." 
                  d  In determining the necessary dimensions of an open-channel spillway for a normally-dry basin, a pond, or a lake, the methodology contained in the "Earth Emergency Spillway Design Data" section of the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" should be used. 
                  e.  Emergency spillway capacity for dams shall be as follows: 
                  (1)  For normally-dry detention basins, ponds, and lakes, having a dam height of less than nine feet and which are incapable of impounding more than 20 acre-feet of water, and for which the probable sequences of dam failure are not severe, an emergency spillway should be provided. Its capacity should be at least equal to the routed 100-year peak flow out of the detention facility assuming the principal spillway is blocked. 
                  (2)  For normally-dry detention basins, ponds, and lakes, having a dam height of nine feet or more and which are capable of impounding 20 acre-feet or more of water, an emergency spillway should be provided. Its capacity should be at least equal to the greater of either the routed 100-year peak flowrate out of the facility assuming the principal spillway is blocked, or the routed one-fourth PMF hydrograph out of the facility. In cases when State or Federal regulations may require greater spillway capacity, those more stringent regulations shall govern. 
                  f.  Emergency overflow for non-earthen dams may take the form of planned structure overtopping. In such cases, however, care must be taken to prevent flows from eroding supporting soils along the toe of or immediately downstream from the dam so as to cause it to be undermined. The profile of the top of the dam shall be so designed as to prevent flows along the ends of the structure which might result in abutment erosion. 
                  (Ord. No. 055-02, 11-11-2002) 
                  9.8.5  Parking Lot Detention Facilities 
                  a.  Parking lot detention facilities shall generally be of one of the two following types: 
                  1.  Depressed areas of pavement at drop inlet locations; and, 
                  2.  Ponding areas along sections of raised curbing. The curbing in these areas is usually higher than a standard curbed section. 
                  b.  The Rational Method shall be utilized for all parking lot detention facility design. 
                  c.  Parking lot detention areas shall be located so as to restrict ponding to areas other than parking spaces near buildings, and to not encroach upon entrance drives. 
                  d.  The maximum depth of detention ponding in a parking lot, except at a flow control structure, shall be six inches for a ten-year storm, and nine inches for a 100-year storm. The maximum depth of ponding at a flow control structure shall be 12 inches for a 100-year storm. 
                  e.  In truck parking areas, the maximum depth of ponding shall be 12 inches for the ten-year storm. 
                  f.  Detention ponding areas are to be drained within 30 minutes after the peak inflow occurs. 
                  g.  Parking lot detention areas shall have a minimum surface slope of one percent, and a maximum slope of five percent. 
                  9.8.6  Undergound and Rooftop Detention Facilities 
                  The design of underground or rooftop detention facilities shall be in accordance with current engineering standard practice, and shall conform to the general spirit and intent of this Article. In the case of rooftop detention, permissible structural loads and weatherproofing shall be governed by the Standard Building Code as amended by Gwinnett County. 
                  9.8.7  Sediment Basins 
                  a.  Stormwater management and sediment trapping functions should be separated whenever possible. Every erosion control design should seek to: first, prevent erosion from occurring; second, trap sediments as close to their sources as possible, and: third, provide a second-tier or backup line of defense against sediments leaving the project site. This backup defense will usually consist of check dams and/or sediment basins. 
                  b.  Whenever a sediment basin and a detention facility are both required on the same watercourse, the sediment basin should be located immediately upstream of the detention facility. 
                  c.  In unusual cases where a normally-dry detention basin is planned to be used to trap sediment as well as provide stormwater control, the basin may be undercut to accommodate the sediment so that the required detention characteristics, particularly volume, will be maintained. 
                  d.  The design of sediment basins shall be in accordance with Appendix C of the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia." 
                  9.8.8  Ponds and Lakes Not Used for Detention 
                  In such cases where a pond or lake is provided as part of a development, but is not planned to function as a stormwater detention facility, the same general and specific criteria contained in these Regulations shall apply, but may be modified in instance where a specific requirement is clearly detention oriented rather than safety-based. 
                  Sec. 9.9. - Culverts And Pipe Collection System Guidelines. 
                  9.9.1  Culverts 
                  a.  Single barrel or single cell culvert structures are less prone to clogging and require less maintenance than multi-barrel or multi-cell installations and should therefore be used whenever feasible. 
                  b.  The maximum velocity in a culvert for the 100-years flow shall be 15 fps (feet per second). Velocities over ten fps shall be considered a special design with particular attention required to pipe or structure invert protection and to fill slope, streambed, and stream bank stability. 
                  c.  The minimum allowable slope shall be that which produces a two-year flow velocity of 2.5 fps. 
                  9.9.2  Piped Collection Systems 
                  a.  The maximum velocity in a piped system for the 100-year flow shall be 15 fps. Velocities over ten fps shall be considered a special design with particular attention required to pipe invert protection and the ability of the receiving waterway or detention facility to accept the flow without damage. 
                  b.  The minimum allowable slope shall be that which produces a two-year flow velocity of 2.5 fps. 
                  c.  The maximum allowable slope for a storm drainage pipe shall be 25 percent. Greater slopes may be approved if installation is in accordance with manufacture's recommendations. In cases where the slope is in excess of ten percent, anchor collars may be required. 
                  d.  A minimum pipe cover of one foot shall be required. 
                  9.9.3  Outlet Location - Culverts and Piped Systems 
                  a.  Outlet structures (such as headwalls) shall not be located closer to the project site's property line with an adjoining property than a flow distance equal to six pipe diameters. For non-circular conduits, this distance shall be six times the rise dimension of the conduit. 
                  b.  The invert elevation of a culvert or pipe outlet shall be no more than two feet above the elevation of the bottom of the receiving watercourse at the outlet. 
                  9.9.4  Energy Dissipation 
                  The maximum developed condition flow velocity at the project site's downstream property line with an adjoining tract shall not exceed the maximum predeveloped condition velocity. Calculations may be required to support this velocity standard on a case-by-case basis. 
                  9.9.5  Discharge of Concentrated Flows 
                  a.  The discharge of concentrated flows of stormwater into public roadways shall be avoided. In no case shall such concentrated flows, including flows from swales, ditches, draws, driveways, or piped systems, exceed the allowable peak flowrates in Table 9-G, below. 
                  b.  In residential subdivisions, the peak flowrate associated with a two-year storm shall not exceed 1.0 cubic feet per second (cfs) along any property line between lots within 50 feet of the building setback line for either lot, unless contained within a piped drainage system or maintained in a natural watercourse. This maximum flowrate may be increased to 1.5 cfs in individual cases where there can be determined to be more than the normal separation between the dwellings on the affected lots.

                  Whenever any subdivision of a tract of land is proposed to be made, whether for residential or nonresidential development, the subdivider is encouraged to present to the Department preliminary documents and graphic exhibits to permit early evaluation of the subdivider's intentions and coordination with the Comprehensive Plan, Zoning Resolution, Metropolitan River Protection Act, etc., and to inform and provide the subdivider with the necessary regulations in order to properly accomplish the proposed project. 
                  11.1.2  Concept Plan Approval 
                  a.  Application for Concept Plan approval shall be submitted to the Department using an application form and in a number of copies to be determined by the Director. The Concept Plan shall include the entire property proposed for development, but need not include the applicant's entire contiguous ownership. 
                  b.  In such case that the subdivider elects not to submit a Concept Plan, then the subdivider may proceed directly with the submittal of Development Plans if they show the entire property proposed for development. In so doing, however, the subdivider assumes the risk of premature design and engineering expenses in the event that the County requires subsequent design and engineering changes. 
                  c.  Following Concept Plan approval, a clearing and grubbing permit may be issued based on a Tree Protection Plan (if required - see Tree Protection Ordinance) and soil erosion and sedimentation control plan approved by the Department, and consistent with an approved Certificate issued under the Metropolitan River Protection Act, if applicable. 
                  d.  Copies of the approved Concept Plan shall be provided to the Department for permanent record, in a number as determined by the Director.

                  (1)  Submit to the Department of Planning and Development a written statement clearly defining the nature of the disagreement, the specific reference to the sections of the regulations (i.e., Sewer Regulations, Development Regulations, etc.) at issue, and the applicant's own opinion. 
                  (2)  Should the department under appeal fail to respond within ten working days from the date of transmittal of the appeal by the Department of Planning and Development, the Department shall automatically forward a copy of the appeal to the Board of Commissioners for final action in their normal course of business. 
                  g.  When the Director has determined that the plat and other Development Plans are in compliance with all applicable County regulations and zoning requirements and approval has been received from all affected County Departments, he shall sign and date a CERTIFICATE OF DEVELOPMENT PLANS APPROVAL stamped or printed on a reproducible copy of the plat. Approved copies of the approved plat and Development Plans shall be transmitted to the applicant and retained by the Department for its records. 
                  h.  Following the above approval by all affected County Departments, a Development Permit shall be issued at the developer's request to begin construction activities based on the approved development plans. 
                  11.1.4  Final Plat Approval

                  b.  The Director shall indicate on a review copy of the plat or in a written memorandum all comments related to compliance of the Final Plat with these Regulations, the Zoning Resolution, conditions of zoning approval, and the regulations of other County departments and State agencies as appropriate. The Director shall have final staff authority to determine the applicability of any and all comments under these Development Regulations, the Zoning Resolution or conditions of zoning approval. 
                  c.  The Director may not approve any Final Plat whereon is shown or by which is otherwise created a lot which would present particularly severe and unusual difficulties for construction of a building, which would clearly require a variance to be reasonably usable, or which is otherwise "unbuildable" due to the presence of floodplain, unusual configuration, lack of Health Department approval, or for any other justified reason. 
                  d.  Lots which would appear to be buildable under certain circumstances and would require further study or additional information before a building permit could be issued, but which present problems or unusual difficulties which can reasonably be addressed or overcome by the lot owner, may be included in the Plat with the appropriate notation of the steps necessary to allow issuance of a building permit (see Section 5.9, Lots, of the General Design Standards). 
                  e.  The subdivider shall be responsible for compliance with all codes, regulations, and zoning requirements and for the satisfaction of all of the comments of the Director. 
                  f.  Final approval by the Director shall not be shown on the Final Plat until all requirements of these and other applicable regulations have been met, and the Director has received a completed request for Approval of Development Conformance and an executed Development Performance and Maintenance Agreement.

                  (1)  All improvements and installations to the subdivision required for approval of the Final Plat under the rules and regulations of Gwinnett County have been completed in accordance with the appropriate specifications; or 
                  (2)  All of the storm water drainage and detention facilities, water and sewer utilities, street base and curbing construction required for approval of the Final Plat have been properly installed and completed and, for those required improvements not yet completed (grassing, pavement topping, required landscaping, sidewalks, etc.) a performance bond shall have been filed by the subdivider with the Development Performance and Maintenance Agreement, which performance bond shall: 
                  (a)  Be conditioned upon the faithful performance by the subdivider or developer of all work required to complete all improvements and installations for the subdivision, or approved portion thereof, in compliance with these rules and regulations within a specified time, not to exceed three months; 
                  (b)  Be payable to, and for the indemnification of, the County;

                  3.  The purpose of these procedures is to state the minimum actions to be taken to fulfill the obligation of the health authority in assuring compliance with the regulations when the continued operation of a restaurant presents a substantial and imminent health hazard to the public or when a food service establishment is in flagrant or continuing violation of this chapter. 
                  4.  Suspension is effective upon service of a written notice thereof, and food service must cease immediately. 
                  5.  The notice must state the basis for the suspension and advise the permit holder of the right to a preliminary hearing on request within 72 business hours of the health authority. 
                  6.  If requested, the preliminary hearing will be held by an experienced supervisory level employee of the health authority not directly involved in the suspension. 
                  7.  The rules of evidence will not apply, but both the health authority and the permit holder may present witnesses, records and argument. 
                  8.  The hearing official will be authorized immediately to rescind or modify the suspension or to continue the suspension with or without conditions. 
                  9.  If the suspension is not rescinded, the permit holder will have the right on request to an evidentiary hearing. If a hearing is not requested, upon correction of all violations, owner may request an inspection to reinstate permit. 
                  (c)  Notice of Hearing. For the purpose of this chapter a notice of hearing is properly served when delivered in person or by registered or certified mail. 
                  (d)  Conditions Warranting Action. The health authority may summarily suspend a permit to operate a food service establishment if it determines through inspection, or examination of employees, food, records, or other means as specified in this chapter, that an imminent health hazard exists. 
                  (e)  Resumption of Operations. If operations of a food service establishment are discontinued due to the existence of an imminent health hazard or otherwise according to law, the permit holder shall obtain approval from the health authority before resuming operations. 
                  (2)  Inspections. 
                  (a)  Risk Categorization. Inspections of a food service establishment shall be conducted based on risk categorization. The risk type shall be determined by the menu items served, the food preparation processes performed, and the previous food safety history in the food service establishment. Each establishment shall be grouped in one of the following categories: 
                  1.  Risk Type I. Frequency of inspection will be one time per year for establishments that do not cook any foods. This includes establishments that may reheat commercially precooked ingredients or foods such as hotdogs and sausages; 
                  2.  Risk Type II. Frequency of inspection will be two times per year for establishments that cook and/or hold and reheat foods that are prepared onsite; or 
                  3.  Risk Type III. Frequency of inspection will be three times per year for establishments that have a required and approved HACCP plan. One of these inspections will be a scheduled inspection to meet with the Certified Food Safety Manager. 
                  (b)  Inspection Frequency. 
                  1.  The health authority may conduct one or more construction/preoperational inspections to verify that the food service establishment is constructed and equipped in accordance with the approved plans and approved modifications of those plans, and is in compliance with law and this chapter. 
                  2.  An initial inspection will be conducted in an establishment prior to the food permit being issued. 
                  3.  The first routine inspection will be conducted within 60 days following the opening of the establishment. 
                  4.  After the first routine inspection, establishments maintaining an "A" food safety grade shall be inspected based on the risk categorization specified in subsection (2)(a)1.—3. of this Rule. 
                  5.  Establishments that receive a "C" or "U" food safety grade will have at least one additional routine inspection added in a twelve-month period, and may have more inspections at the discretion of the health authority. 
                  6.  An establishment that maintains an "A" food safety rating on three consecutive routine inspections may have the frequency of routine inspections reduced to one time per year for Risk Type II establishments and reduced to two times per year for Risk Type III establishments at the health authority's discretion. 
                  7.  The reduced inspection frequency may continue until the food service establishment incurs a grade of a "B", "C" or "U". The routine inspection frequency will then resume to the number specified for Risk Type, but may be more frequent as deemed necessary for the enforcement of this chapter by the health authority. 
                  (c)  Follow-up Inspections. Follow-up inspections may be conducted at anytime at the discretion of the health authority, but must be conducted within ten days after an establishment receives a grade "U". 
                  (d)  Access. 
                  1.  Representatives of the health authority, after proper identification, shall be permitted to enter any food service establishment or operation at any reasonable time for the purpose of making inspections and review of pertinent records to determine compliance with this chapter. Should access be denied, an inspection warrant may be obtained as authorized in O.C.G.A. § 31-5, Article 2. 
                  2.  If a person denies access to the health authority, the health authority shall: 
                  (i)  Inform the person that: 
                  (I)  The permit holder is required to allow access to the health authority, 
                  (II)  Access is a condition of the acceptance and retention of a food service establishment permit to operate, and 
                  (IV)  If access is denied, an inspection warrant, issued by the appropriate authority to order access, may be obtained according to law; and 
                  (ii)  Make a final request for access. 
                  (e)  Inspection of Mobile Food Service Units. When inspecting a mobile food service unit in a county other than the county of origin, the health authority will contact the health authority in the county of origin to find out the violations received during the last inspection of the base of operation. These violations will be noted as violations during the inspection of each mobile unit. 
                  (f)  Report of Inspection. 
                  1.  The health authority shall document on the department's current approved "Food Service Establishment Inspection Report" form and "Food Service Inspection Report Addendum" form(s): 
                  (i)  Administrative information about the food service establishment's legal identity, street and mailing addresses, type of establishment and operation, inspection date, and other information which may include such information as type of water supply and sewage disposal, status of the permit, and personnel certificates that may be required; 
                  (ii)  Specific factual observations of violations or other deviations from this chapter that require correction by the permit holder including: 
                  (I)  Failure of the person in charge to demonstrate the knowledge of foodborne illness prevention, application of HACCP principles, and the requirements of this chapter as specified under Rule .03 subsections (1)(a)—(c). 
                  (II)  Failure of food employees, conditional employees, and the person in charge to report a disease or medical condition as specified under Rule .03 subsections (4)(b) and (d), 
                  (III)  Nonconformance with Risk Factor and Public Health Intervention provisions of this chapter, 
                  (IV)  Failure of the appropriate food employees to demonstrate their knowledge of, and ability to perform in accordance with, the procedural, monitoring, verification, and corrective action practices required by the health authority for a variance or HACCP Plan, 
                  (V)  Failure of the person in charge to provide records required by the health authority for determining conformance with a HACCP plan as specified under Rule .02 subsection (5)(d), 
                  (VI)  Nonconformance with critical limits of a HACCP plan; and 
                  (iii)  The numerical score and equivalent grade, based on debiting the appropriate points for violations and repeat violations of code provisions found or observed during the inspection. 
                  2.  Upon the completion of the inspection, the evaluating official shall have the person in charge sign the inspection report form. The person in charge's signature shall not necessarily indicate agreement with the findings noted on the inspection. 
                  3.  The health authority shall: 
                  (i)  Inform a person who declines to sign an acknowledgment of receipt of inspectional findings that: 
                  (I)  An acknowledgment of receipt is not an agreement with findings, 
                  (II)  Refusal to sign an acknowledgment of receipt will not affect the permit holder's obligation to correct the violations noted in the inspection report within the time frames specified, and 
                  (III)  A refusal to sign an acknowledgment of receipt is noted in the inspection report and conveyed to the health authority's historical record for the food service establishment; and 
                  (ii)  Make a final request that the person in charge sign an acknowledgment receipt of inspectional findings. 
                  (g)  Displaying of the Inspection Report. 
                  1.  The most current inspection report shall be prominently displayed in public view at all times, within 15 feet of the front or primary public door and between five feet and seven feet from the floor and in an area where it can be read at a distance of one foot away. 
                  2.  Food service establishments with drive-thru windows will post the current inspection report specified under 1. of this subsection, and also have the inspection report posted so that a minimum of the top one-third of a copy of the current inspection report is visible through each window allowing customers to easily read the score, date of inspection and establishment information. 
                  3.  At food service establishments with no primary or public door, the current inspection report shall be prominently displayed at all times where the documents can be read by the public from a distance of one foot away. If requirements of this paragraph are not possible because of physical restrictions, a location will be determined as approved by the health authority. 
                  4.  The food service establishment inspection report addendum(s), completed by the health authority during an inspection, will not be required to be displayed, but will be made available by the food service establishment to the public upon request. 
                  (h)  Violation Categories. 
                  1.  Violations of this chapter are categorized according to their potential for creating a health risk to the consumer. All violations shall be recorded on the current inspection report and addendum(s). Violations are divided into two categories, Risk Factors/Public Health Interventions (RF/PHI) Categories and Good Retail Practices (GRP) Categories. 
                  2.  Violation of Risk Factors/Public Health Interventions (RF/PHI) categories are prominent on the inspection report because maintaining these items in compliance is vital to preventing foodborne illness. These items are numbered 1 to 9 on the inspection report and divided into Subcategory "1" and "2" as follows: 
                  (i)  Subcategory "1" items cover provisions of the code, that when applied, would directly prevent, eliminate or reduce hazards to a safe level to protect consumer health. Because the probability of occurrence and severity of a hazard is greater when these provisions are out of compliance, the incidence and impact of foodborne illness is increased and therefore a point value is assigned for a violation of any subcategory "1" item of nine points, and 
                  (ii)  Subcategory "2" items cover provisions of the code, that when applied, would indirectly prevent, eliminate or reduce hazards to a safe level to protect consumer health. Because the probability of occurrence and severity of a hazard is lower than subcategory "1" when these provisions are out of compliance, the incidence and impact of foodborne illness is not as great and therefore a point value is assigned for a violation of any subcategory "2" item of four points. 
                  3.  Risk Factors and Public Health Interventions (RF/PHI) Categories include: 
                  (i)  Supervision. 
                  (ii)  Employee health, good hygienic practices, preventing contamination by hands. 
                  (iii)  Approved source. 
                  (iv)  Protection from contamination. 
                  (v)  Cooking of potentially hazardous foods, consumer advisory. 
                  (vi)  Holding of potentially hazardous foods, datemarking of potentially hazardous foods. 
                  (vii)  Highly susceptible populations. 
                  (viii)  Chemicals. 
                  (ix)  Conformance with approved procedures. 
                  4.  Good Retail Practices (GRP) categories are deemed to be operational and maintenance violations that, if not corrected, increase the potential for causing food borne illness. A violation of an item in a GRP category constitutes a one to three point deduction from the overall score (maximum 100 points) as delineated on the current food services establishment inspection report form. 
                  5.  Good Retail Practices Categories (GRP) include: 
                  (i)  Safe food and water, food identification. 
                  (ii)  Food temperature control. 
                  (iii)  Pest and animal control. 
                  (iv)  Prevention of food contamination. 
                  (v)  Proper use of utensils. 
                  (vi)  Utensils, equipment and vending. 
                  (vii)  Water, plumbing and waste. 
                  (viii)  Physical facilities. 
                  (ix)  Other. 
                  (i)  Timely Correction of Risk Factors/Public Health Intervention (RF/PHI) Categories and HACCP Plans. 
                  1.  Except as specified in 2. of this subsection, a person in charge shall at the time of inspection correct a violation of a Risk Factors/Public Health Interventions (RF/PHI) of this chapter and implement corrective actions for a HACCP plan provision that is not in compliance with its critical limit. 
                  2.  Considering the nature of the potential hazard involved and the complexity of the corrective action needed, the health authority may agree to or specify a longer time frame, not to exceed ten calendar days after the inspection, for the permit holder to correct violations of a Risk Factors/Public Health Intervention item or HACCP plan deviations. 
                  3.  Failure to correct these violations to the satisfaction of the health authority may result in such emergency action as deemed necessary by the health authority including actions pursuant to O.C.G.A. §§ 31-5-2(b); 31-5-9(a). 
                  (j)  Time Frame for Correction of Good Retail Practices Categories. 
                  1.  Except as specified in 2. of this subsection, the permit holder shall correct Good Retail Practices (GRP) categories within 72 hours of the food service establishment's receipt of the inspection report or as otherwise directed by the health authority. Failure to make timely corrections to the satisfaction of the health authority of Good Retail Practices (GRP) categories may subject the food service establishment to suspension or revocation of its permit pursuant to subsection (1)(b) of this Rule. 
                  2.  The health authority may approve a compliance schedule that extends beyond the time limits specified under 1. of this subsection if a schedule of compliance is submitted by the permit holder and no health hazard exists or will result from allowing an extended schedule for compliance. 
                  (k)  Verification and Documentation of Correction. 
                  1.  After observing at the time of inspection a correction of a violation of a Risk Factor/Public Health Intervention (RF/PHI) item or deviation, the health authority shall enter the violation and information about the corrective action on the inspection report. 
                  2.  As specified under subsection (2)(j)2. of this Rule, after receiving notification that the permit holder has corrected a violation of a Risk Factors/Public Health Interventions (RF/PHI) or HACCP plan deviation, or at the end of the specified period of time, the health authority shall verify correction of the violation, document the information on an inspection report or addendum, and enter the report in the health authority's records. 
                  (l)  Grading Inspections. Inspections will receive a letter grade based on the numerical score as follows: 
                  1.  "A". The letter grade "A" means food safety excellence and is applied to numerical score of 90 to 100. 
                  2.  "B". The letter grade "B" means satisfactory compliance and is applied to numerical score of 80 to 89. 
                  3.  "C". The letter grade "C" means marginal compliance and is applied to numerical score of 70 to 79. 
                  4.  "U". The letter grade "U" means unsatisfactory compliance and is applied to numerical score of 69 or less. 
                  (m)  Repeat Violations. A repeat violation means a violation of the same code provision of this chapter under an item in a Risk Factors/Public Health Interventions (RF/PHI) or Good Retail Practices (GRP) category as documented in the previous routine inspection. A repeat violation constitutes the initial point deduction as specified in subsection (2)(h)2. and 4. of this Rule plus an additional two point deduction for one or more repeat violation(s) within a RF/PHI category and one point deduction in a GRP category from the overall score (maximum 100 points). If a repeat violation of the same code provision of this chapter occurs for three consecutive routine inspections, then the points will be deducted accordingly and the food service establishment may be subject to suspension or revocation of its permit pursuant to subsection (1)(b) of this Rule. 
                  (n)  Follow-up Inspections. 
                  1.  A follow-up inspection means a complete inspection done as a result of a routine inspection. A follow-up inspection will be conducted when the establishment earns a "C" or "U" grade on a routine inspection. If a grade of "C" or higher is earned on the follow-up inspection, then no additional follow-up inspections will be conducted, however all RF/PHI violations must be corrected as specified under subsection 2(j)1.—3. of this Rule. 
                  2.  The new score and equivalent grade will be posted on an inspection report during a follow-up inspection. The two previous inspection grades and scores, whether routine and/or follow-up inspections, will be posted subsequently under "Last Grade, Score and Date" and "Prior Grade, Score and Date" on the inspection report. 
                  (o)  Informal Follow-up Inspection. If a follow-up inspection as specified in subsection (2)(n) of this Rule cannot be conducted by the health authority, then an informal follow-up may be performed to confirm correction of the violations that were cited on the routine inspection that were not corrected at the time of the inspection. On an informal follow-up inspection, an inspection report addendum(s) will be completed, documenting the violations that have been corrected. It will be noted on the addendum(s) that this was an informal follow-up inspection, and the establishment will keep the same grade that was earned on the previous routine inspection. The addendum(s) will be made available by the food service establishment to the public upon request. 
                  (p)  Voluntary Closure. 
                  1.  A food service establishment that is graded as a "U" and does not earn at least a grade "C" within ten days of receiving the "U" will be requested to voluntarily close until all violations are corrected and/or have enforcement action taken to suspend or revoke the food service permit according to subsection (1)(b) of this Rule. 
                  2.  A food service establishment that is graded as a "U" on two consecutive routine inspections will be asked to voluntarily close until all violations are corrected and/or have enforcement action taken to suspend or revoke the food service permit pursuant to subsection (1)(b) of this Rule. 
                  (3)  Examination, Condemnation and Public Notice. 
                  (a)  Examination of Food. Food may be examined or sampled by the health authority when necessary to determine freedom from adulteration or misbranding. 
                  (b)  Condemnation of Food. 
                  1.  The health authority may, upon written notice to the owner or person in charge, place a hold order on any food that the health authority determines or has probable cause to believe to be unwholesome or otherwise adulterated, or misbranded. Under a hold order, food shall be moved to a suitable holding area for storage until a hold order release or destruction order is issued. No food subject to a hold order shall be used, served, or removed from the establishment except as specified in 2. of this subsection. Immediate destruction shall be ordered and accomplished if there is risk to public health. 
                  2.  If the health authority has reasonable cause to believe that the hold order will be violated, or finds that the order is violated, the health authority may remove the food that is subject to the order to a place of safekeeping. 
                  3.  The hold order notice shall: 
                  (i)  State that food subject to the order may not be used, sold, moved from the food service establishment, or destroyed without a written release of the order from the health authority; 
                  (ii)  State the specific reasons for placing the food under the hold order with reference to the applicable provisions of this chapter and the hazard or adverse effect created by the observed condition; 
                  (iii)  Completely identify the food subject to the hold order by the common name, the label information, a container description, the quantity, health authority's tag or identification information, and location; 
                  (iv)  State that the permit holder has the right to an appeal hearing and may request a hearing within 72 business hours of the health authority; 
                  (v)  State that the health authority may order the destruction of the food if a timely request for a hearing is not received; and 
                  (vi)  Provide the name and address of the health authority representative to whom a request for an appeal hearing may be made. 
                  (4)  Procedure When Infection is Suspected. 
                  (a)  Investigation and Control. The health authority shall act when it has reasonable cause to believe that a food employee or conditional employee has possibly transmitted disease; may be infected with a disease in a communicable form that is transmissible through food; may be a carrier of infectious agents that cause a disease that is transmissible through food; or is affected with a boil, an infected wound, or acute respiratory infection, by: 
                  1.  Securing a confidential medical history of the food employee or conditional employee suspected of transmitting disease or making other investigations as deemed appropriate; and 
                  2.  Requiring appropriate medical examinations, including collection of specimens for laboratory analysis, of a suspected food employee or conditional employee. 
                  (b)  Restriction or Exclusion of Food Employee, or Summary Suspension of Permit. Based on the findings of an investigation related to a food employee or conditional employee who is suspected of being infected or diseased, the health authority may issue an order to the suspected food employee, conditional employee or permit holder instituting one or more of the following control measures: 
                  1.  Restricting the food employee or conditional employee; 
                  2.  Excluding the food employee or conditional employee; or 
                  3.  Closing the food service establishment by summarily suspending a permit to operate in accordance with law. 
                  (5)  Variance. 
                  (a)  Modifications and Waivers. The department may grant a variance by modifying or waiving the requirements of this chapter if in the opinion of the department a health hazard or nuisance will not result from the variance. If a variance is granted, the department shall retain the information specified under subsection 5.(b) of this Rule in its records for the food service establishment. 
                  (b)  Documentation of Proposed Variance and Justification. Before a variance from a requirement of this chapter is approved, the information that shall be provided by the person requesting the variance and retained in the department's file on the food service establishment includes: 
                  1.  A statement of the proposed variance of the chapter requirement citing relevant rule and subsection numbers; 
                  2.  An analysis of the rationale for how the potential public health hazards and nuisances addressed by the relevant rules and subsections will be alternatively addressed by the proposal; and 
                  3.  A HACCP plan if required that includes the information specified under Rule .02 subsections (5)(a)—(e) as it is relevant to the variance requested. 
                  (c)  Conformance with Approved Procedures. If the department grants a variance as specified in subsection (5)(a) of this Rule, or a HACCP plan is otherwise required as specified under Rule .02 subsections (5)(a)—(e), the permit holder shall: 
                  1.  Comply with the HACCP plans and procedures that are submitted as specified under Rule .02 subsections (5)(a)—(e) and approved as a basis for the modification or waiver; and 
                  2.  Maintain and provide to the department, upon request, records specified under Rule .02 subsections (5)(d) and (e) that demonstrate that the following are routinely employed; 
                  (i)  Procedures for monitoring the critical control points, 
                  (ii)  Monitoring of the critical control points, 
                  (iii)  Verification of the effectiveness of the operation or process, and

                  2.  Due to the combined effects of compaction, contact area and fines associated with gravel aggregate, the effective infiltrative surface area is reduced by an estimated 50%. 
                  3.  The minimum amount of effective trench bottom infiltrative surface area per linear foot shall be equivalent to the conventional 36-inch wide gravel system. 
                  4.  Sidewall area shall not be considered for design reduction. The minimum amount of effective sidewall infiltrative surface area per linear foot shall be equivalent to the conventional 36-inch wide gravel system. 
                  5.  The minimum storage volume required for a system shall be equivalent to the conventional 36-inch wide gravel system. 
                  6.  The design absorption area required is based on the most hydraulically limiting soil horizon that comes into contact with the infiltrative surface of the sidewall, trench bottom and for a distance one foot below the absorption trench bottom. 
                  Infiltration area for conventional 36-inch wide gravel trench absorption 
                  Sidewall Infiltration Area: 2 sq. ft./ft × .50 = 1 sq.ft./linear foot 
                  Trench Bottom Infiltration Area: 3 sq. ft./ft × .50 = 1.5 sq.ft./linear foot 
                  Storage Volume: 3 cubic feet/linear foot × 7.48 gallons/cubic foot × .35 = 7.85 gallons/linear foot
