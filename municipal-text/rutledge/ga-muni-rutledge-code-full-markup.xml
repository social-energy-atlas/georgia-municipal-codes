PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Rutledge, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1994 Code, as updated through April 19, 2010, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the mayor and city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1994 Code, as updated, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Mary McEwen, Code Attorney, and Jack Renfroe, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Debbie Rutherford for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City of Rutledge readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  In the construction of this Code and of all ordinances, the following rules shall be observed unless such construction would be inconsistent with the manifest intent of the mayor and city council. 
                  (1)	General rule. All words and phrases shall be construed and understood according to the common and approved usage of the language, but technical words and phrases and such others as may have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law shall be construed and understood according to such peculiar and appropriate meaning. 
                  (2)	Gender. Every word in any Code provision or ordinance importing the masculine gender shall extend to and be applied to females as well as males, and vice versa.

                  (6)	Delegation of authority. Whenever a provision requires the head of a department or other officer of the city to do some act or perform some duty, it shall be construed to authorize subordinates to do the required act or perform the required duty unless the terms of the provision designate otherwise. 
                  (7)	Computation of time. The time within which an act is to be done as provided in any code provision or ordinance or in any order issued pursuant to any ordinance, when expressed in days, shall be computed by excluding the first day and including the last, except that if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday it shall be excluded; and when any such time is expressed in hours, the whole of Sunday, from midnight to midnight, shall be excluded. When the period of time prescribed is less than seven days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays shall be excluded in the computation. 
                  (8)	Overlapping provisions. Where any provision of this Code imposes greater restrictions upon the subject matter than any general provisions imposed by this Code, the provision imposing the greater restriction or regulation shall be applicable.

                  (10)	Conjunctions. Where a provision involves two or more items, conditions, provisions or events connected by the conjunction "and," "or" or "either … or," the conjunction shall be interpreted as follows, provided in appropriate cases the terms "and" and "or" are interchangeable: 
                  a.	The term "and" indicates that all the connected items, conditions, provisions or events shall apply. 
                  b.	The term "or" indicates that the connected items, conditions, provisions or events may apply singly or in any combination. 
                  c.	The term "either … or" indicates that the connected items, conditions, provisions or events shall apply singly, but not in combination. 
                  (11)	Liberal construction and minimum requirements. All general provisions, terms, phrases and expressions contained in this Code shall be liberally construed in order that the true intent and meaning of the city council may be fully carried out.

                  (b)	The history notes appearing in parentheses after sections in this Code are not intended to have any legal effect but are merely intended to indicate the source of matter contained in the section.

                  (a)	Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Meeting means the gathering of a quorum of the members of the governing body of an agency or of any committee of its members created by such governing body, whether standing or special, pursuant to schedule, call, or notice of or from such governing body or committee or an authorized member, at a designated time and place at which official business or policy of the agency is to be discussed or at which official action is to be taken or, in the case of a committee, recommendations on official business or policy to the governing body are to be formulated or discussed. The assembling together of a quorum of the members of a governing body or committee for the purpose of making inspections of physical facilities under the jurisdiction of such agency or for the purposes of meeting with the governing bodies, officers, agents, or employees of other agencies at places outside the geographical jurisdiction of an agency and at which no final official action is to be taken shall not be deemed a meeting. 
                  (b)	Meetings. The city council shall hold regular meetings at 7:00 p.m. on the second Monday of the month at the city hall, unless otherwise ordered by the city council, provided, that the mayor may convene the city council whenever in his opinion the public business requires it, and he shall do so upon the application of two members of the city council. All meetings at which official actions are to be taken shall be open to the public. 
                  (1)	Notice. The mayor and city council shall prescribe the time, place, and dates of regular meetings of the mayor and city council. Such information shall be available to the general public and a notice containing such information shall be posted and maintained in a conspicuous place available to the public at the regular meeting place of the agency. Meetings shall be held in accordance with a regular schedule, but nothing in this subsection shall preclude an agency from canceling or postponing any regularly scheduled meeting. Whenever any meeting required to be open to the public is to be held at a time or place other than at the time and place prescribed for regular meeting, the mayor and city council shall give due notice thereof. Due notice shall be the posting of a written notice for at least 24 hours at the place of regular meetings and giving of written or oral notice at least 24 hours in advance of the meeting to the legal organ in which notices of sheriff's sales are published in the county where regular meetings are held or, at the option of the mayor and city council, to a newspaper having a general circulation in said county at least equal to that of the legal organ; provided, however, that in counties where the legal organ is published less often than four times weekly, "due notice" shall be the posting of a written notice for at least 24 hours at the place of regular meetings and, upon written request to any local broadcast or print media outlet whose place of business and physical facilities are located in the county, notice by telephone or facsimile to that media outlet at least 24 hours in advance of the called meeting. When special circumstances occur and are so declared by the mayor and city council, the mayor and city council may hold a meeting with less than 24 hours' notice upon giving such notice of the meeting and subjects expected to be considered at the meeting as is reasonable under the circumstances, including notice to the county legal organ or a newspaper having a general circulation in the county at least equal to that of the legal organ, in which event the reason for holding the meeting within 24 hours and the nature of the notice shall be recorded in the minutes. Whenever notice is given to a legal organ or other newspaper, that publication shall immediately make the information available upon inquiry to any member of the public. Any oral notice required or permitted by this subsection may be given by telephone. 
                  (2)	Agenda and minutes. An agenda of the subjects acted on and those members present at a meeting of the mayor and city council shall be written and made available to the public for inspection within two business days of the adjournment of a meeting of the mayor and city council. The minutes of a meeting of the mayor and city council shall be promptly recorded and such records shall be open to public inspection once approved as official by the agency, but in no case later than immediately following the next regular meeting of the mayor and city council; provided, however, nothing contained in this chapter shall prohibit the earlier release of minutes, whether approved by the mayor and city council or not. The minutes shall, at a minimum, include the names of the members present at the meeting, a description of each motion or other proposal made, and a record of all votes. In the case of a roll-call vote, the name of each person voting for or against a proposal shall be recorded, and in all other cases it shall be presumed that the action taken was approved by each person in attendance unless the minutes reflect the name of the persons voting against the proposal or abstaining. 
                  (3)	Duty to attend. It shall be the duty of each member of the city council to attend each meeting of the city council unless he is prevented by some unavoidable circumstance.

                  Sec. 2-32. - Rules for the conduct of business. 
                  Except as otherwise provided in this section, Robert's Rules in Plain English, 2nd Edition, shall govern the conduct of city council meetings. 
                  (1)	Call to order. All meetings of the city council shall be open to the public. The mayor, or in his absence, the mayor pro tempore, shall take the chair at the hour appointed for any regular, temporarily adjourned, special, or called meeting; and shall immediately call the city council meeting to order. 
                  (2)	Roll call. Before proceeding with the business of the city council, the city clerk/treasurer or his deputy shall call the roll of the members, and the names of those present shall be entered in the minutes. 
                  (3)	Quorum. A majority of all the members elected to the city council shall constitute a quorum at any regular or special meeting of the city council and an affirmative vote of a majority of such number shall be sufficient to permit the conduct of all business except that for which a larger vote has been mandated by this Code. 
                  (4)	Order of business. The business of the city council shall be taken up for consideration and disposition in the following order: 
                  a.	Call to order by presiding officer.
                  b.	Roll call.
                  c.	Approval of minutes of previous meeting.

                  i.	Adjournment.
                  (5)	Reading of minutes. Unless a reading of the minutes of a city council meeting is requested by a member of the city council, such minutes may be approved without a reading if the city clerk/treasurer has previously furnished each member with a copy thereof. 
                  (6)	Reports by committees. Any business coming before the city council concerning the subject matter of which any standing or special committee has jurisdiction may be referred to the proper committee for investigation and report. It shall be the duty of each standing or special committee, whenever required by the mayor or by the city council, or any member of the city council, to examine any matter referred to such committee, and make a report thereof at the next regular meeting of the city council, or show good cause why no report is made. Such reports shall not be in writing unless so directed by the presiding officer. Each standing committee shall examine the matters within its jurisdiction, and make such reports and recommendations from time to time as may be necessary. 
                  (7)	Manner of addressing council. No member, while the city council is in session, shall speak on any subject unless recognized by the presiding officer. Every speaker shall address the chair and no member shall interrupt anyone who is speaking, except to call him to order or for explanation. 
                  (8)	Limitations on addressing city council. Any person not a member of city council who desires to address the city council shall first secure the permission of the presiding officer, and then shall step up in front of the rail, give his name and address in an audible tone of voice for the record, and direct his remarks to the city council as a body rather than to any particular member, limiting such remarks to five minutes unless additional time is granted by city council. 
                  (9)	Ordinances, resolutions, regulations, contracts and inter-local agreements. Unless otherwise provided in this Code or under state law, all ordinances, resolutions, contracts, and inter-local agreements of the city shall be prepared, approved, introduced, and adopted in the following manner: 
                  a.	Preparation. All ordinances shall be prepared by the city attorney. No ordinance shall be prepared for presentation to the city council unless ordered by a majority vote of the city council, or requested in writing by the mayor, or prepared by the city attorney on his own initiative. 
                  b.	Administrative staff approval. All ordinances, resolutions, and contract documents shall, before presentation to the city council, have been approved as to form and legality by the city attorney or his authorized representative, and shall have been examined and approved for administration by the mayor or his authorized representative where there are substantive matters of administration involved. All such instruments shall have first been referred to the head of the department under whose jurisdiction the administration of the subject matter of the ordinance, resolution, or contract document would involve and be approved by the department head; provided, however, that if approval is not given, then the same shall be returned to the mayor with a written memorandum of the reasons why such approval is withheld. In the event the questioned instrument is not redrafted to meet a department head objection, or objection is not withdrawn and approval in writing given, then the mayor shall so advise the city council and give the reasons advanced by the department head for withholding approval. 
                  c.	Introduction and adoption. 
                  1.	Every proposed ordinance shall be introduced in writing and in the form required for final adoption. No ordinance shall contain a subject which is not expressed in its title. The enacting clause shall be "the Council of the City of Rutledge hereby ordains …" and every ordinance shall so begin. 
                  2.	An ordinance may be introduced by any member of the city council and be read at a regular or special meeting of the city council. Upon introduction of any ordinance, the city clerk/treasurer shall, as soon as possible, distribute a copy to the mayor and to each member of the city council and shall file a reasonable number of copies in the office of the city clerk/treasurer and at such other public places as the city council may designate. 
                  3.	No ordinance shall be put on its final passage on the same day it is introduced.
                  4.	All ordinances shall have two separate readings, but shall never be had on the same day. 
                  5.	No ordinance shall relate to more than one subject, which shall be clearly expressed in its title, and no ordinance, or section thereof, shall be amended or repealed unless the new ordinance contains the title of the ordinance or section amended or repealed, and when practicable all ordinances shall be introduced as amendments to this Code. 
                  6.	An ordinance, resolution, or contract shall be deemed, adopted, or rejected by the city council in accordance with the rules which the city council shall establish. Such ordinances adopted by the city council shall have the full force and effect of law. 
                  d.	Effective date. Except where applicable in subsection (9)e of this section, no ordinance shall take effect until five days after the date of its publication, except a public emergency ordinance necessary for the protection of public health, public safety, public property, or the public peace may be made effective upon adoption. 
                  e.	Emergencies. To meet a public emergency affecting life, health, property, or public peace, the city council may convene on call of the mayor or three members of the city council and may promptly adopt an emergency ordinance, but such ordinance shall not levy taxes; grant, renew, or extend a franchise; regulate the rate charged by any public utility for its services; or authorize the borrowing of money except for loans to be repaid within 30 days. An emergency ordinance shall be introduced in the form prescribed for ordinances generally, except that it shall be plainly designated as an emergency ordinance and shall contain, after the enacting clause, a declaration stating that an emergency exists and describing the emergency in clear and specific terms. An emergency ordinance may be adopted, with or without amendment, or rejected at the meeting at which it is introduced, but the affirmative vote of at least three members of the city council shall be required for adoption. It shall become effective upon adoption or at such later time as it may specify. Every emergency ordinance shall automatically stand repealed 30 days following the date upon which it was adopted, but this shall not prevent reenactment of the ordinance in the manner specified in this section if the emergency continues to exist. An emergency ordinance shall also be repealed by adoption of a repealing ordinance in the same manner specified in this section for adoption of emergency ordinances. 
                  (10)	Recording vote. Whenever any member shall request it, the yeas and nays of the members present shall be recorded on the minutes on any question taken. 
                  (11)	Questions of order. The presiding officer shall decide all questions of order, but any councilmember who is dissatisfied with the decision may appeal to the city council in the manner provided by Robert's Rules in Plain English, 2nd Edition, for appealing from decisions of presiding officers. 
                  (12)	Elections. All elections by the city council shall be by ballot, and a majority vote of the whole city council shall be necessary to an election. 
                  (13)	Executive session. The city council may, at any time, upon call therefor by the presiding officer or upon motion duly carried by a councilmember, meet in executive session. Attendance at such sessions shall be limited to the mayor and members of city council and such invitees as shall be invited with the unanimous consent of the mayor and city council.

                  Sec. 4-106. - Licensee qualifications. 
                  The following standards shall be applied to all decisions pertaining to the issuance or denial of licenses hereunder: 
                  (1)	No pouring license shall be granted to any person or partnership unless the person or all partners shall be at least 25 years of age and has/have been a resident of the state for a minimum of one year prior to filing an application for such license. In the event a corporation should be an applicant and the corporation has not been incorporated and/or allowed to do business by the Secretary of State for said one-year period, then the incorporator of the corporation and the owners of at least 80 percent of the stock of the corporation shall all have been residents of the state for one year prior to filing an application for such license. 
                  (2)	All applicants for a pouring license must show financial responsibility. The mayor and city council may require all applicants to provide financial statements and other evidence of financial responsibility in conjunction with the application. The form of the application shall be set by the mayor and city council, and must be fully completed by the applicant and filed by the applicant with the city clerk/treasurer of the mayor and city council. 
                  (3)	No officials or employees of the city or members of its mayor and city council shall be eligible to receive a pouring license. However, a private club is not automatically disqualified from receiving a retail consumption license because such club is organized or owned by or operated by one or more members of the mayor and city council and/or employees of the city. 
                  (4)	No pouring license shall be granted to any person unless the front door of the building at the proposed location is situated not less than 100 yards from the property line of any church or any building used as an alcohol rehabilitation center, and not less than 200 yards from any school ground or college campus. This distance is to be measured by the most direct route of travel on the ground. For purposes of this subsection, "the most direct route of travel on the ground," means the shortest route available to a pedestrian utilizing legal means of foot travel (i.e., sidewalks, crosswalks and road shoulders; not jaywalking). Each application for a license shall include a scale drawing of the location of the proposed premises showing the distance to the nearest church, school ground or college campus and alcohol rehabilitation center, or a certificate of a registered surveyor that such location complies with this section. 
                  (5)	No pouring license shall be issued to any person unless complete and detailed diagrams of the building in which the business will be located and the outside premises are attached to the application, or unless proposed plans and specifications and a building permit of a proposed building to be built are attached to the application. The completed building or the proposed building shall comply with ordinances of the mayor and city council, regulations of the state revenue commissioner, and the laws of the state. Upon completion, the proposed building shall be subject to final inspection and approval by the city building inspector. Each applicant for a license shall attach to his application evidence of ownership of the building or proposed building or a copy of the lease if the applicant is leasing the building. Licensees shall provide on the premises for which the license is issued adequate sanitary toilet facilities as required by the city health and building codes, and the building shall be adequately illuminated so that all hallways, passage ways and open areas may be clearly seen by customers therein. 
                  (6)	All applicants for a pouring license must be the owner or lessee of the premises to be used for the sale and consumption of malt beverages and wine, and must provide evidence of ownership of the premises in the form of a fully executed deed in recordable form, or, if applicant is leasing the premises, the applicant must provide a copy of the lease. 
                  (7)	A separate pouring license shall be required for each pouring location of each place of business. Each license will enable the licensee to sell the malt beverages and wine for consumption only in the areas of the premises allowed by state laws and regulations. 
                  (8)	All applicants must be persons operating as the proposed licensed place of business a "restaurant" or "private club" as defined in this chapter, except in the case of an exception under section 4-107. No lounges shall be permitted. 
                  (9)	No applicant who, within the ten years prior to the date of application, has a conviction of or has pled nolo contendere to a felony or a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude shall be granted a license if such conviction tends to indicate that the applicant would not maintain the operation for which a license is being sought in conformity with the laws and regulations of the federal or state governments, or the laws and regulations of the city. No license shall be granted to an applicant who has been convicted under any federal, state or local law for a criminal offense involving alcoholic beverages, gambling or tax law violations if such conviction tends to indicate that the applicant would not maintain the operation for which a license is being sought in conformity with the laws and regulations of the federal or state governments, or the laws and regulations of the city. All operators, managers, clerks, and other employees must meet these requirements, as well. 
                  (10)	Any applicant denied a license shall be prohibited from applying for another license for a period of one year from the filing date set forth on the application. Any partnership, company, corporation, trust or other entity in which an individual applicant is a member, shareholder, director or officer, or in which such entity acts as a surrogate for such applicant, shall also be subject to the prohibition contained in this subsection. 
                  (11)	A license may be denied to any applicant where it appears that the applicant would not have adequate financial participation in the proposed business to direct and manage its affairs, or where it appears that the applicant is intended to be a mere surrogate for a person who would not otherwise qualify for a license for any reason whatsoever. 
                  (12)	The mayor and city council, in its discretion, may consider any extenuating circumstances which may reflect favorably or unfavorably on the applicant's application or the proposed location of the business. If in the judgment of the mayor and city council circumstances are such that the granting of the license would not be in the best interest of the general public, such circumstances may be grounds for denying the application. 
                  (13)	A corporate license applicant shall appoint and designate to the mayor and city council an agent authorized to receive service of process under the laws of the state. If no such designation is made, the mayor and city council may serve or notify the applicant or license holder at any address of the applicant or license holder known to the mayor and city council. 
                  (14)	The mayor and city council shall give notice in writing to the applicant of any decision to grant or deny an application. The notice shall give the reasons for the decision. 
                  (15)	Whenever the mayor and city council shall deny an application for a pouring license, the applicant shall have ten days following the date of notice of the denial to request a hearing before the mayor and city council. The applicant shall be entitled at such a hearing to present evidence and cross examine opposing witnesses.

                  Sec. 4-107. - Temporary license. 
                  (a)	Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, a person may apply as a qualified restaurant even though the establishment has not yet been in operation for the previous 12 months. Because it is not possible to determine if such restaurant has annual food sales which are 75 percent or more of its total gross sales and it is not possible to determine if such restaurant has annual food sales in excess of $50,000.00, the mayor and city council may in its discretion consider the size and seating capacity of the restaurant, the size and seating capacity of any lounge therein, the size and type of kitchen facilities and all other relevant factors to determine if it appears substantially likely that the restaurant will qualify for a license under this article. If the mayor and city council anticipate that the establishment will qualify for a license, they may vote to award the applicant a temporary license not to exceed 90 days. At or before the conclusion of the 90-day period, the mayor and city council shall use a pro rata analysis to determine if the applicant is operating a qualified restaurant as is defined in this chapter. If the mayor and city council has determined that the restaurant is qualified under this chapter, the applicant may make application for a license under section 4-105 
                  (b)	Notwithstanding any other provision of this article to the contrary, a nonprofit organization which has at least 50 members regularly paying monthly, quarterly, semiannual or annual dues and has received and has maintained approval from the United States Internal Revenue Service as a bona fide 501(c)(3) organization, and has not applied for a license under section 4-105, may apply for a special event license. To make application for such license, the organization must comply with all the following: 
                  (1)	Make application at least 14 days prior to the first date of the proposed license period; and 
                  (2)	Pay a fee per licensed event in an amount that shall be established by the city council from time to time and set forth in the schedule of fees and charges, available for examination in the office of the city clerk; and 
                  (3)	Not hold more than 12 days and/or nights of such sales per calendar year nor make such sales on more than three consecutive days and/or nights; and 
                  (4)	All sales of malt beverages and/or wine must be for fundraising, or to directly further the purpose of the organization, or made in conjunction with service of a meal; and 
                  (5)	All sections of this article must be complied with except sections 4-105, 4-106, 4-109 and 4-111; and 
                  (6)	Only one such permit shall be issued for any one location within the incorporated limits of the city and such location shall be stated in the application; and 
                  (7)	All applicants for a license must be of good character, and all operators, managers, clerks or other employees shall be of good character. Furthermore, corporate or firm applicants shall also be of good business reputation; and 
                  (8)	Whenever the mayor and city council shall deny an application for a license, the applicant shall have ten days following the date of notice of denial to request a hearing before the mayor and city council. The applicant shall be entitled at such a hearing to present evidence and cross examine opposing witnesses; and 
                  (9)	No license under this section shall be transferable or assignable to any person or other location. Under no circumstances will the temporary license fee be refunded to the organization.

                  Sec. 4-108. - Days of operation. 
                  No licensee shall furnish, sell or offer for sale any malt beverages and/or wine under this article at any of the following times; 
                  (1)	On Sundays before the hour of 12:30 p.m. or after 12:00 Midnight; or
                  (2)	At any time on Christmas Day; or
                  (3)	At any time in violation of a local ordinance or regulation or of a special order of the mayor and city council; or 
                  (4)	At any time in violation of state law or regulation.

                  Sec. 4-109. - Reports. 
                  (a)	Each licensee under this article shall, as a condition of maintaining such license, file with the city clerk/treasurer within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter: 
                  (1)	A sworn statement of the licensee's sales during the preceding calendar quarter on forms approved by the city. The forms for such quarterly verified statements shall reflect the licensee's gross dollar sales amount for total sales for the applicable calendar quarter, the gross dollar sales amount for malt beverages and wine for the applicable calendar quarter, and gross dollar sales amount for food items for the applicable calendar quarter. 
                  (2)	Certified copies of the licensee's state department of revenue sales and use tax monthly reports as filed with the state department of revenue for each month during the respective calendar quarter. 
                  (b)	Any sale of a food or beverage containing any malt beverage and/or wine shall be deemed to be a sale solely of a malt beverage and/or wine, and such sale shall not be included as a "food sale" in the quarterly reports. The fact that the sale of food during any calendar quarter exceeds by three times the sales of malt beverages and/or wine shall not be conclusive that the licensee is meeting the requirements of operating a restaurant as defined in this chapter. However, the failure of the food sales to so exceed by three times the sale of malt beverages and wine shall be prima facie evidence that the establishment is not meeting the definition of a restaurant. 
                  (c)	The quarterly statements shall be confidential in nature and shall not be open for public inspection except as otherwise required by law. Such forms shall be used solely by the mayor and city council for determination of whether or not the licensee remains qualified to hold its pouring license. Failure to timely file such statements shall be a violation of this article punishable by a fine of up to $500.00 and cause for revocation of the license granted under this article.

The fee shall be paid prior to the issuance of any license. The fee shall accompany the application and shall be either a cash payment or a bank certified check.

The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)	Minimum requirements/BMPs.
                  (1)	Best management practices as set forth in this subsection (b) and in subsection (c) of this section shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(2) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)	A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection (b)(2) shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)	Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by an issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)	The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)	The issuing authority may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15) and (16) of this section, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)	The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)	Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)	Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
                  (3)	Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
                  (4)	Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
                  (5)	The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)	Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
                  (7)	Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)	Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)	To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection (c)(9), a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)	Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)	Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
                  (12)	Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)	Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)	Land disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section; 
                  (15)	Except as provided in subsection (c)(16) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table yearround; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of article 5, chapter 5 of title 12, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq., the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection (c)(15). The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.	No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.	The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)	There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of title 12, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq., the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.	No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.	The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)	Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)	The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. of 4-19-2010, § 1(35-104)) 
                  Sec. 18-22. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)	General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)	Application requirements. 
                  (1)	No person shall conduct any land disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the city building inspector to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)	The application for a permit shall be submitted to the City Building Inspector and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 18-21(b) and (c) will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three (3) full size copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)	In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of an issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)	Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 18-21(c)(15) and (16) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6) of this section, has been obtained. Such review will not be required if the issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised Plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)	If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)	The issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this article or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)	Plan requirements. 
                  (1)	Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 18-21(b) and (c), or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. The current certification number of the design professional must be on all erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)	Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted. A labeling system that corresponds with the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist must be incorporated into the plans. 
                  (d)	Permits. 
                  (1)	Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)	No permit shall be issued by the issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 18-21(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(6) of this section are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)	Any land disturbing activities by an issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the issuing authority. 
                  (4)	If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)	The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)	The issuing authority may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1).

                  Sec. 18-23. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)	The city building inspector will periodically inspect the sites of land disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)	The issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)	The city building inspector shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land disturbing activities. 
                  (d)	No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)	The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The districts or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The districts or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)	The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as an issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as an issuing authority.

                  Sec. 18-24. - Penalties and incentives. 
                  (a)	Failure to obtain a permit for land disturbing activity. If any person commences any land disturbing activity requiring a land disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the issuing authority. 
                  (b)	Stop work orders. 
                  (1)	For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the issuing authority shall issue a stop work order requiring that land disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  (2)	For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop work order; and 
                  (3)	All stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  (4)	When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)	Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 18-22(b)(6). The issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)	Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any city charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article under county ordinances approved under this article shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

                  (Code 1994, § 24-110) 
                  Sec. 18-59. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The city council finds that the city is blessed with a diverse and abundant cover of trees which is of general aesthetic value to the city. This ecological diversity makes the city a desirable place for residents, and visitors alike. The appearance of the city from the public ways contributes ecologically and aesthetically to the economic prosperity of the city and demonstrates pride in its natural heritage. However, the growth and development of the city oftentimes requires the removal of trees and other plant material, thereby contributing to the depletion of a most valuable natural resource. Therefore, it is necessary to protect, preserve and restore this valuable asset, and the city declares the purposes and intent of this section to be as follows: 
                  (1)	To aid in stabilizing the environment's ecological balance by contributing to the processes of air purification, oxygen regeneration, and carbon dioxide reduction, and stormwater runoff retardation, while at the same time aiding in noise, glare and heat abatement; 
                  (2)	Prevent reductions in the drainage holding capacity of land;
                  (3)	Prevent soil erosion;
                  (4)	Prevent streams, ditches and other waterways from silting;
                  (5)	Moderate temperature extremes with natural tree cover;
                  (6)	Maintain moisture levels in the air;
                  (7)	Minimize noise and glare;
                  (8)	To provide a habitat for living things that might not otherwise live or survive in urban and suburban environs; 
                  (9)	To encourage the preservation of existing trees and vegetation;
                  (10)	To provide visual buffering and enhance the beauty of the city;
                  (11)	To safeguard and enhance property values thereby protecting public and private investments;
                  (12)	To preserve the unique identity and environment of the city;
                  (13)	To conserve energy and to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
                  (Code 1994, § 24-101) 
                  Sec. 18-60. - Applicability. 
                  This section provides full power and authority over all trees located within street rights-of-way, parks and public places of the city; and to trees located on private property except as noted below: 
                  (1)	Description of zone. The tree protection zone shall correspond to the entirety of a tract of land for which no tree protection plan has been approved. After such approval, the tree protection zone shall correspond to that part of a tract of land designated as a tree protection area in such plan. 
                  (2)	Exemptions. The section shall not apply to the following: 
                  a.	Tracts of land for which the zoning ordinance imposes no yard requirements and permits 100 percent coverage of the lot by buildings; 
                  b.	Property occupied by single-family dwelling, unless:
                  1.	Nonresidential uses or additional dwelling units are proposed for such property; or
                  2.	Construction, paving, or other activity on the property will damage trees on the public right-of-way; 
                  c.	Property containing at least five acres in areas zoned as "industrial" according to the latest zoning map of the city; or 
                  d.	Property upon which is located improvements in the amount of at least $50,000.00, and the owner of the property is not increasing the value of the improvements by more than 50 percent. 
                  (Code 1994, § 24-105) 
                  Sec. 18-61. - Tree protection plan. 
                  (a)	Protective measures. In the tree protection zone, protective measures shall be applied to the aboveground portion of a tree and to roots within the critical root zone, as follows: 
                  (1)	Damage prohibited. No person shall: 
                  a.	Cut, carve, transplant, or otherwise damage or remove any tree;
                  b.	Attach any rope, wire, nails, advertising posters, or other contrivance to any trees;
                  c.	Allow any gaseous, liquid, or solid substance which is harmful to trees (such as concrete washout, fuel, lubricants, herbicides, paint) to come in contact with them; or 
                  d.	Set a fire or permit any fire to burn when such fire or the heat thereof will injure any portion of any tree. 
                  (2)	Fence required. During excavation, filling, construction, or demolition operations, each tree or stand of trees shall be protected against damage to bark, roots, and low-hanging branches with a fence enclosing the critical root zone (four feet high, two-inch by four-inch posts; with double one-inch by four-inch rails, plastic construction area fencing, or 12-gauge two-inch by four-inch wire mesh). "Tree save area" signs shall be posted on all sides of the fenced area. 
                  (3)	Compaction prohibited. All buildings materials, vehicles, construction equipment, dirt, debris, or other objects likely to cause soil compaction or aboveground damage shall be kept outside the critical root zone. Where a limited amount of encroachment is unavoidable and is approved by the building official, the critical root zone shall first be mulched with a four-inch layer of processed pine bark or wood chips or a six-inch layer of pine straw. 
                  (4)	Grade changes prohibited. There shall be no raising or lowering of the ground level within the critical root zone. Stripping of topsoil in the critical root zone shall not be permitted. Where necessary, the use of moderate fill is permitted only with prior installation of an aeration system approved by the building official. Deposition of sediment in the critical root zone shall be prevented by placement of sediment barriers, which shall be backed by two-inch by four-inch wire mesh in areas of steep slope. 
                  (5)	Ditches, trenches prohibited. No person shall excavate any ditch, tunnel, or trench within the critical root zone. Where such encroachment is unavoidable and is approved by the building official, tunneling rather than trenching shall be used. If roots must be cut, root pruning procedures approved by the building official must be employed. 
                  (6)	Paving prohibited. No person shall pave with concrete, asphalt, or other impervious material within the critical root zone. 
                  (b)	Tree protection plan. A proposal for development or improvement of any tract of land a tree protection plan, including trees to be planted in order to meet the minimum requirements of this article. (The tree protection plan may be included in the soil erosion and sediment control plan.) Such plan shall be submitted to the building official prior to any grading, bulldozing, or other removal of the existing vegetation that may affect the health of existing tree coverage. The plan shall show the following: 
                  (1)	Name and address of owner of record and applicant;
                  (2)	Boundary lines of the tract by lengths and bearings, streets adjoining the property, total area of the tract, north point, graphic scale, and date; 
                  (3)	All existing specimen trees, including those to be removed and all other trees ten inches DBH or greater which will remain on the site and be protected during construction; and trees less than ten inches DBH which are submitted for credit under subsection (e)(6) of this section. The owner of the property shall indicate the common and botanical names and the size of each tree. In heavily wooded areas that will not be disturbed, the site plan may show only the boundaries of each stand of trees and a list of the number, size, and species of ten-inch DBH or large trees in each stand; 
                  (4)	Locations of proposed buildings, structures and paved areas;
                  (5)	Locations of all utility lines. Utility lines must be placed along corridors between critical root zones of trees which will remain on the site; 
                  (6)	Limits of land disturbance, clearing, grading, and trenching;
                  (7)	Limits of tree protection areas, showing trees to be maintained and planted, specifying species and size; 
                  (8)	Grade change, or other work adjacent to a tree which would affect it adversely, with drawings or descriptions as to how the grade, drainage, and aeration will be maintained around the tree; and 
                  (9)	Planting schedule.
                  (c)	Determination of site density factor. The minimum required quantity of trees on a site after development must produce a total site density factor (SDF) of 25 units per acre. The site density factor (SDF) is determined as follows: 
                  SDF = (total site area, in acres) × 25 
                  (d)	The number of new trees to be planted shall be determined as follows:
                  (1)	Using Table 1, calculate the existing density factor (EDF) of trees of ten-inch diameter (DBH) or greater which will remain on the site and be protected during construction. Existing trees of less than ten inches DBH but at least two inches DBH may be counted as 0.5 unit each, provided such trees have grown in uncrowded conditions and have developed normal spread or are part of a specimen tree stand. Add together the individual units for each tree to got the EDF. 
                  TABLE 1 CONVERSION FROM DBH TO EXISTING DENSITY FACTOR 

                   
                  (2)	To calculate the replacement density factor (RDF), subtract the existing density factor (EDF) from the site density factor (SDF). 
                  RDF = SDF - EDF

                  (e)	Application of density factors to the plan. 
                  (1)	Planting areas. Required planting areas as follows: 
                  a.	The tree protection zone includes strips of at least the following depths adjacent to property lines (plus strips required by buffer or landscape requirements elsewhere in this article) permitting only the encroachment of driveways necessary to serve the property: 

                   
                  b.	No tree shall be planted closer to a building foundation or water, sewer, electrical, or natural gas line, than as follows: 
                  1.	Five feet for a mature small tree.
                  2.	15 feet for a mature large tree.
                  c.	No tree shall be planted under overhead utility distribution lines if the average mature height of the tree is greater than the lowest overhead wire. 
                  d.	Landscape islands shall be provided within parking areas of six or more spaces, but shall not be required within vehicle storage or display areas. 
                  1.	The total area of all islands shall comprise at least five percent of parking lot area in commercial and residential zoning districts or three percent of parking lot area in industrial zoning district; plus one percent of other vehicle use areas on the property (such as loading, storage, or display areas). 
                  2.	Each island shall contain a minimum of 50 square feet. It shall be so shaped that a five-foot diameter circle will fit within the island. No portion of an island less than three feet in width may be counted in the area. 
                  3.	Landscape islands shall be located in such a manner as to divide and break up the expanse of paving. 
                  4.	Vehicles may overhang a landscape island provided the island is at least 3½ feet in depth per abutting parking space, at least five feet in depth overall, and protected by wheel stops or curbing. Two feet of the landscaped area may count as part of the required depth of each abutting parking space. 
                  (2)	Distribution of trees. 
                  a.	At least one shade tree shall be planted in each required landscape island, and at least one tree shall be planted for every 30 linear feet of length in each required planting strip. 
                  b.	Where trees must be added to achieve the SDF, such additions shall be made between the street and the front of the building until such additions comprise at least half the SDF. 
                  (3)	Existing trees in excess of the SDF. Existing trees which are in excess of the minimum site density factor (SDF) requirement but are outside the development area shall not be removed unless adjacent development would cause irreparable damage to the critical root zones. 
                  (4)	Criteria for replacement trees. 
                  a.	Spacing and the potential size of species chosen shall be compatible with special limitations of the site. 
                  b.	The species must be ecologically compatible with the specifically intended growing site. 
                  c.	The trees must have the potential for size and quality comparable to those removed.
                  d.	Preference shall be given to specimens of no more than three inches DBH.
                  e.	Authority for questions of tree characteristics shall be Elbert L. Little, The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Trees: Eastern Region (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1980); Barbara Ferguson, ed., All About Trees (San Francisco: Ortho Books, 1982); publications of the Georgia Forestry Commission; publications of the Cooperative Extension Service of the University of Georgia College of Agriculture; or other authority acceptable to the city. 
                  (5)	Specimen and non-specimen trees. Emphasis shall be given to the preservation of specimen trees, even isolated individual trees, over retention of other trees. Non-specimen trees, however, should be saved in stands rather than as individual trees scattered over a site. 
                  (6)	Reduction of development area. Where the proposed development area is so large that the minimum SDF cannot be achieved, the development area shall be reduced by removing parking spaces in excess of the minimum required, placing additional planting islands within the development area, or reducing the area to be occupied by buildings.

                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Nuisance means anything which causes hurt, inconvenience, or damage to another, provided that the hurt, inconvenience, or damage complained of shall not be fanciful, or such as would affect only one of fastidious taste, but rather such as would affect an ordinary reasonable person; and the fact that the act done may otherwise be lawful shall not keep it from being a nuisance. 
                  Nuisance per se mean an act or occupation which is a nuisance at all times and under any circumstances, regardless of location or surroundings. 
                  Nuisance, private, means a nuisance limited in its injurious effects to one of a few individuals. 
                  Nuisance, public, means a nuisance which damages all persons who come within the sphere of its operation, though it may vary in its effects on individuals.

Proceedings to abate a nuisance, whether public or private, shall be initiated by the filing of a complaint with the city clerk/treasurer, which complaint shall state the nature and location of the nuisance and the name and address of the complainant. In the case of a private nuisance, the complaint shall be filed by the person injured by the nuisance; in the case of a public nuisance, the complaint shall be filed on behalf of the public by a city official or by a citizen specifically injured by the nuisance. 
                  (2)	Notice of hearing. Upon the filing of a complaint as provided in subsection (1) of this section, the city clerk/treasurer shall issue a notice directed to the owner of the premises upon which the nuisance complained of is located and, if the person maintaining the same is a different person from the owner, then also to the person maintaining the nuisance, calling on such person to show cause, either personally or by attorney, at the time and place directed by the city clerk/treasurer, why such activity alleged to be a nuisance should not be ordered abated and removed by the mayor and city council. Such notice shall be served at least five days prior to the date set forth the hearing by any authorized officer of the city, and shall be made either personally or by leaving a copy at the party's most well-known place of abode. A copy of such notice shall also be mailed to the complainant or complainants. 
                  (3)	Order of abatement. If, after hearing all the evidence, the mayor and city council should decide that the activity complained of is a nuisance, the mayor shall issue an order. The order shall specify within that time it is to be abated by the defendant. If not abated within the specified time, the city clerk/treasurer shall issue a writ directed to the police chief or any member of the police force, commanding that the nuisance be abated. A copy of such order of abatement shall be served on the party or parties maintaining the nuisance. If the city removes the nuisance the expenses incurred in the removal shall be paid by the owner. 
                  (4)	Effect of noncompliance. In the event of a refusal to comply with the order of abatement issued by the mayor, the person maintaining the nuisance shall be subject to arrest for violation of state law.

                  (1)	With good and sufficient surety approved by the city council;
                  (2)	Satisfactory to the city attorney in form and substance; and
                  (3)	Conditioned upon the permittee's agreement to secure and hold harmless the city and its officers against any and all claims, judgments, or other costs arising from the excavation and other work covered by the excavation permit or for which the city, the city council, or any city officer may be made liable by reason of any accident or injury to persons or property through the fault of the permittee either in not properly guarding the excavation or for any other injury resulting from the negligence of the permittee, and further conditioned on the permittee's agreement to fill up, restore, and place in good and safe condition as near as may be to its original condition, and to the satisfaction of the director of public works, all openings and excavations made in streets, and to maintain any street where excavation is made in as good condition for the period of 24 months after the work shall have been done, usual wear and tear excepted, as it was in before the work shall have been done.

                  (4)	Where flagmen are deemed necessary by the city, they shall be furnished by the permittee at its own expense. Through traffic shall be maintained without the aid of detours, if possible. In instances in which this would not be feasible, the director of public works will designate detours. The city shall maintain roadway surfaces of existing highways designated as detours without expense to the permittee, but in case there are no existing highways, the permittee shall construct all detours at its expense and in conformity with the specifications of the director of public works.

Where in the protection of such property it is necessary to enter upon private property for the purpose of taking appropriate protective measures, the permittee shall obtain permission from the owner of such private property for such purpose. The permittee shall, at its own expense, shore up and protect all buildings, walls, fences, or other property likely to be damaged during the progress of the excavation work and shall be responsible for all damage to public or private property or highways resulting from its failure to properly protect and carry out said work.
