PREFACE

        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a complete republication of the ordinances and resolutions of the County of Whitfield of a general and permanent nature. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1979 Code, as supplemented through December 10, 2007 and ordinances and resolutions subsequently adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1979 Code, and any subsequent ordinances and resolutions included herein. 
                  The chapters of the code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the code is included at the back of this volume. 
                  Numbering System 
                  The numbering system used in this code is the same system used in many state and county codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 2 is numbered 2-1 and the ninth section of Chapter 4 is 4-9. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 3-2 and 3-3 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 3-2.1, 3-2.2 and 3-2.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 6 and 7, it will be designated as Chapter 6.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
                  Index 
                  The index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology and still others in language generally used by municipal officers and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of B. Meade White, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
                  The republished Code was prepared under the supervision of A. Lawton Langford, Corporate President and Calista A. Humphreys, Supplement Editor, with the able assistance of the MCC staff. 
                  The publishers are most grateful to Lenard Whaley, County Administrator, Brooks Lansing, Commissioner, Stephen B. Farrow, Assistant County Attorney, and Jim Campbell, Chief Magistrate, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the County readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the county's affairs. 
                  ADOPTING ORDINANCE 
                  An Ordinance Adopting and Enacting a New Code for the County of Whitfield; Providing for the Repeal of Certain Ordinances Not Included Therein; Providing a Penalty for the Violation Thereof; Providing for the Manner of Amending Such Code; and Providing When Such Code and This Ordinance Shall Become Effective. 
                  The Board of Commissioners Ordains: 
                  Section 1.  The Code entitled the "Code of Ordinances, Whitfield County, Georgia" published by Municipal Code Corporation consisting of Chapters 1 through 15 is adopted. 
                  Section 2.  All ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted on or before March 8, 1988, and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein, are repealed. 
                  Section 3.  The repeal provided for in Section 2 hereof shall not be construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance that is repealed by this ordinance. 
                  Section 4.  Unless another penalty is expressly provided, every person convicted of a violation of any provision of the Code or any ordinance, rule or regulation adopted or issued in pursuance thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisonment of not more than sixty (60) days, or both, or as otherwise provided by law. Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. 
                  The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any Code section whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the County may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief, and revocation of licenses or permits. 
                  Section 5.  Additions or amendments to the Code when passed in the form as to indicate the intention of the Board of Commissioners to make the same a part of the Code shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments. 
                  Section 6.  Ordinances adopted after March 8, 1988, that amend or refer to ordinances that have been codified in the Code, shall be construed as if they amend or refer to like provisions of the Code. 
                  Section 7.  This ordinance shall become effective March 8, 1988. 
                  Passed and adopted by the Board of Commissioners of Whitfield County this 8th day of March, 1988. 

                   
                  SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
                  The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code and are considered "Included." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code and are considered "Omitted." 
                  In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

                  (b)  The repeal of an ordinance or resolution shall not affect any punishment or penalty incurred before the repeal took effect, nor any suit, prosecution or proceeding pending at the time of the repeal, for an offense committed or cause of action arising under the ordinance or resolution repealed, nor any right acquired or liability incurred under any ordinance or resolution repealed.

                  Sec. 2-102. - Revenue policy. 
                  The county levies property taxes and assesses user charges for public works, public safety, and human resources. This policy is intended to provide guidance in assessing and collecting these revenues. 
                  (1)  The county shall maintain a diversified and stable revenue system, combining elastic and inelastic revenue sources to shelter it from fluctuations and minimize the effect of economic downturns. 
                  (2)  The county shall diversify the revenue base to reduce dependence upon property taxes. 
                  (3)  The county shall avoid nuisance taxes and charges and shall strive to keep the revenue system simple and friendly to taxpayers and service recipients. 
                  (4)  The county shall strive to minimize or eliminate all forms of subsidization between entities, funds, services, and customers to maintain equity in its structure. 
                  (5)  The county shall establish user charges at a level related to the total cost of providing that service. Issues to be considered when establishing user charges are ability to pay, effect of pricing on demand, identifiable benefits, discouragement of waste, and cost of collection. All fees and/or charges shall be reviewed annually. 
                  In establishing new fees and/or charges, the county shall consider the following issues: 
                  a.  Sufficiency. Fees and/or charges should recover the full cost.

                  c.  Simplicity. Fees and/or charges should be easily understood by the payee and the county employees. 
                  (6)  The county shall adopt an aggressive policy toward revenue collection. 
                  (7)  The county shall maintain a good understanding of the revenue sources and shall adopt procedures for collection to meet operational objectives. 
                  (8)  The county shall strive to maintain a five-year projection for revenues and expenditures. 
                  (9)  The county shall maintain property taxes at a level adequate to fund basic services. 
                  (10)  The county shall seek public and private grants, contracts, and other outside funds sources.

                  Sec. 2-103. - Deposits and cash management policy. 
                  The deposits and cash management policy is written to provide guidance to employees of Whitfield County in handling receipts of cash and checks from customers and vendors and for the management of cash kept on the premises. Proper adherence to the policy provides protection to both the employee and to the county and provides the documents necessary to efficiently manage the county's bank accounts. 
                  (1)  Deposits. Many employees receive funds for deposit on behalf of Whitfield County. However, the county administrator is ultimately responsible for the proper management of the county's bank accounts. It is therefore essential for those employees taking deposits to follow the same policy. The guidelines for deposits are as follows: 
                  a.  All deposits will be listed on the deposit slips and will designate cash and/or checks. 
                  b.  Deposits will be balanced prior to completing the bottom deposit slip. 
                  c.  Both copies of the bottom deposit slip will be stamped with the proper account number for deposit. 
                  d.  Deposit bags will be secured for delivery to the bank. 
                  e.  Upon return from the bank, the bank deposit slip will be attached to the original deposit slip as well as the journal and any supporting documents for the monthly reconciliation. 
                  (2)  Cash management. Each employee handling cash must accept responsibility for his or her own cash bag. Security and control are important factors that should be applied to all areas of cash management. Following are the guidelines for proper cash management: 
                  a.  The county must bond any employee that handles cash on a regular basis. 
                  b.  Each employee should have his or her own cash bag. There should be no sharing of bags at any time. 
                  c.  Each employee should have a key that opens his or her bag only. There should be a second key to each bag for emergency purposes that is accessible only through the county administrator. In the event that a bag must be used when an employee is absent, two employees should count the bag before use and at the end of the day and initial and date the balance sheet. 
                  d.  Employees should count bags at the beginning and end of each day and initial and date the balance sheet. When an employee leaves his or her workstation, the bag should be secured (ex. placing bag in locked compartment).

                  Sec. 2-111. - Policy objectives. 
                  Per O.C.G.A. § 36-83-2 G, "public interest is served by maximum and prudent investment of idle public funds so that the need for taxes and other public revenue is decreased commensurately with the earning on such investments." It is the objective of Whitfield County to invest idle public funds in a manner that will provide the highest investment return while insuring safety and liquidity as well as complying with the above state code section. Investment decisions are made with the judgement and care of a prudent person, not for speculation, but for investment.

The county administrator shall maintain a list of authorized institutions and shall review this list annually. On a quarterly and annual basis, the county administrator shall prepare a report of the investment program that shall be presented to the board of commissioners.

                  Sec. 2-113. - Objectives. 
                  In order to maximize investment return, the county shall pool all funds except those restricted or categorized as special funds. The county shall seek to reduce the credit risk, reduce interest rate risk, meet liquidity requirements, and maximize the rate of return. These objectives shall be achieved through long-term cash flow projections, diversification of investments and utilization of qualified institutions and brokers/dealers. Investment decisions shall be made impartially and any material interest in an institution or agency that can be construed to cause a conflict of interest shall be disclosed to the county. 
                  The county shall also issue a request for proposal for banking services to financial institutions in the geographic area every three years beginning in 2002.

                  DIVISION 3. - CASH AND DEPOSITS 

                  Sec. 2-120. - Cash handling policy. 
                  Each employee handling cash must accept responsibility for his or her own cash bag. Security and control are important factors that should be applied to all areas of cash handling. Following are the guidelines for proper cash handling: 
                  (1)  The county must bond any employee that handles cash on a regular basis. 
                  (2)  Numbered receipts must be given for cash or checks received from all customers and vendors. 
                  (3)  All checks received must be immediately stamped "For Deposit Only". 
                  (4)  Each employee should have his or her own cash bag. There should be no sharing of bags at any time. 
                  (5)  Each employee should have a key that opens his or her bag only. There should be a second key to each bag for emergency purposes that is accessible only through the accounting supervisor. In the event that a bag must be used when an employee is absent, two employees should count the bag before use and at the end of the day and initial and date the balance sheet. 
                  (6)  Employees should count bags at the beginning and end of each day and initial and date the balance sheet. When an employee leaves his or her workstation, the bag should be secured (ex. placing bag in locked compartment). 
                  (7)  All departments must turn over funds to the finance department daily. 
                  (8)  The finance department must give numbered receipts for all funds turned over to them for deposit. 
                  (9)  The finance department will make daily deposits of funds received from all sources. 
                  (10)  All deposits will be listed on the deposit slips and will designate cash and/or checks. 
                  (11)  Deposit bags will be secured for delivery to the bank. 
                  (12)  The bank deposit receipt will be printed on the yellow deposit slip at the time of the deposit. The yellow deposit slip will remain in the bank deposit book for monthly reconciliation. 
                  (Ord. of 9-9-02) 
                  Sec. 2-121. - Deposits and cash management policy. 
                  (a)  Deposits. Many employees receive funds for deposit on behalf of Whitfield County. However, the county administrator is ultimately responsible for the proper management of the county's bank accounts. It is therefore essential for those employees taking deposits to follow the same policy. The guidelines for deposits are as follows: 
                  (1)  All deposits will be listed on the deposit slips and will designate cash and/or checks. 
                  (2)  Deposits will be balanced prior to completing the bottom deposit slip. 
                  (3)  Both copies of the bottom deposit slip will be stamped with the proper account number for deposit. 
                  (4)  Deposit bags will be secured for delivery to the bank. 
                  (5)  Upon return from the bank, the bank deposit slip will be attached to the original deposit slip as well as the journal and any supporting documents for the monthly reconciliation. 
                  (b)  Cash management. Each employee handling cash must accept responsibility for his or her own cash bag. Security and control are important factors that should be applied to all areas of cash management. Following are the guidelines for proper cash management: 
                  (1)  The county must bond any employee that handles cash on a regular basis. 
                  (2)  Each employee should have his or her own cash bag. There should be no sharing of bags at any time. 
                  (3)  Each employee should have a key that opens his or her bag only. There should be a second key to each bag for emergency purposes that is accessible only through the county administrator. In the event that a bag must be used when an employee is absent, two employees should count the bag before use and at the end of the day and initial and date the balance sheet. 
                  (4)  Employees should count bags at the beginning and end of each day and initial and date the balance sheet. When an employee leaves his or her workstation, the bag should be secured (ex. placing bag in locked compartment).

                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 2016-1212, § 1, adopted Jan. 9, 2017, repealed the former Art. IV, §§ 2-131—2-159, and enacted a new Art. IV as set out herein. The former Art.

                  Sec. 2-131. - Open meetings. 
                  All meetings of the board of commissioners, whether regular meetings, special-called meetings, or work sessions, shall be held in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 50-14-1, et seq. The public shall, at all times, be afforded access to all meetings other than executive sessions. 
                  (Ord. No. 2016-1212, § 1, 1-9-17) 
                  Sec. 2-132. - Executive sessions. 
                  (a)  Closed meeting. As provided below, and in accordance with Georgia law, the board of commissioners may close to the public a portion of a meeting in order to discuss certain topics that are exempted from the Open Meetings Law, O.C.G.A. § 50-14-1, et seq. Such a meeting shall be referred to as an "executive session." Any portion of the meeting not subject to any exemptions authorized by law shall be open to the public. 
                  (b)  Executive session. Executive sessions of the board of commissioners may be held for the purpose of discussing topics exempted from public access requirements by O.C.G.A. §§ 50-14-2 and 50-14-3, including, but not limited to: 
                  (1)  Pending or potential litigation. The board of commissioners may close an open meeting to discuss topics subject to the attorney-client privilege to the extent the board of commissioners consults with the county attorney or other legal counsel engaged by the county attorney to discuss pending or potential litigation, settlement, claims, administrative proceedings or other judicial actions brought by or against Whitfield County, a county official, or employee. The county attorney or other attorney representing the county must be present in the executive session. In order to close a meeting because of potential litigation, there must be a real and tangible threat of legal action against the county or a bona fide inquiry with intent by the county to commence legal action, previous or pre-existing litigation between the county and the other party, or the hiring of an attorney by the threatening party. 
                  (2)  Personnel matters. The board of commissioners may close an open meeting to discuss or deliberate upon the appointment, employment, compensation, hiring, disciplinary action, dismissal, or evaluation of a county official or employee, except that the board of commissioners must receive evidence or hear arguments upon proposed disciplinary action or dismissal of a county official or employee in an open meeting. Any action must be taken in an open meeting and shall be entered in the minutes of the open meeting. 
                  (3)  Records that could compromise public security. The board of commissioners may close an open meeting to review or discuss records that, if made public, would endanger life, safety, or public property by compromising security against sabotage, criminal acts or terrorist acts. Such records include, but are not limited to, security plans, vulnerability assessments for public buildings or facilities, anti-terrorist plans, plans, drawings, or blueprints that reveal security devices, or otherwise compromise security and contingency plans for meetings. 
                  (4)  Real property. Negotiations to purchase, dispose of, or lease real property, or to enter a contract or option for such purpose, may be made in executive session, subject to approval in a subsequent public vote. 
                  (c)  Procedure for entering into executive session. An executive session shall not be held except pursuant to the unanimous affirmative vote of all members of the board of commissioners present and voting at that meeting. The minutes of the open meeting shall reflect the names of the commissioners present, those voting for the executive session, and the specific reasons for the executive session. 
                  (d)  Who may attend executive session. Board members and only individuals necessary to conduct the executive session may be present. The county clerk and the county administrator shall be included in any executive session approved by the board of commissioners, unless expressly barred either by the chair or by not less than three members of the board of commissioners present during the course of an executive session. The county attorney (or other attorney authorized by the county attorney representing the board) must be included in any executive session. Other individuals may be invited to participate in an executive session, either by invitation of the chair or with the consent of not less than three members of the board of commissioners present during the course of the executive session, but only if the presence of such individuals is consistent with the applicable exception authorizing the executive session. No other individuals shall be permitted in the executive session. 
                  (e)  Non-exempt topics. If any person in an executive session attempts to discuss a non-exempt topic during an executive session, the chair shall immediately rule that person out of order and such discussion shall cease. If person shall persist in discussing the non-exempt topic, the chair shall either cause the person to be removed from the executive session or adjourn the meeting immediately. 
                  (f)  Executive session minutes. Minutes of executive sessions shall also be recorded but shall not be open to the public. Such minutes shall specify each issue discussed in executive session by the agency or committee. In the case of executive sessions where matters subject to the attorney-client privilege are discussed, the fact that an attorney-client discussion occurred and its subject shall be identified, but the substance of the discussion need not be recorded and shall not be identified in the minutes. Such minutes shall be kept and preserved for in camera inspection by an appropriate court should a dispute arise as to the propriety of any executive session. 
                  (g)  Chair or presiding officer affidavit. The chair or other presiding officer shall execute an affidavit stating, under oath, that the executive session was devoted to topics exempt from the public access requirements. The affidavit shall include the specific exemption to the Open Meetings Law. The affidavit shall be notarized and filed with the minutes of the open meeting. 
                  (h)  Discussion of executive session business . Commissioners, officials, employees, and other individuals who attend executive sessions are prohibited from discussing or in any other way disclosing confidential information, legal advice and/or legal strategy discussed in the executive session unless: 
                  (1)  The disclosure is required by law; or 
                  (2)  The disclosure is part of a judicial or administrative proceeding. 
                  This subsection shall not prevent a county attorney (or other authorized attorney representing the board) from discussing any matters discussed in executive session relative to settlement or negotiation of a lawsuit or other claim against the county. Any commissioner who divulges, has previously divulged, or has threatened to divulge, confidential information, legal advice, or strategy discussion may be excluded from participation in an executive session and/or publicly sanctioned by the determination of not less than three commissioners.

                  (a)  A quorum of the members of the board of commissioners must be present for conducting meetings of the board. At least three members of the board must be present to constitute a quorum. 
                  (b)  Not more than two times during any calendar year, any commissioner may be counted as present for purposes of quorum and voting by attending a meeting remotely. In order for remote attendance to be effective, the absent commissioner must be able to see and hear the proceedings in real time and the commissioners at the meeting location must be able to see and hear the absent commissioner in real time. 
                  (c)  Any commissioner may raise a point of order directed to the chair if he or she believes that a quorum is not present. If, during the course of a meeting, one or more commissioner(s) leaves and a quorum no longer exists, the meeting may not continue. If a quorum is not attained (or re-attained) within 30 minutes, the meeting may be rescheduled by the chair. 
                  (d)  Generally, passage of a motion shall require the affirmative vote of a majority of commissioners present and voting at a meeting at which a quorum is present. Therefore, if only three commissioners are voting, then a majority of at least two affirmative votes shall be required for the passage of a motion. Otherwise, not less than three affirmative votes shall be required for the passage of a motion. 
                  (e)  For the taking of certain actions, more than at least three affirmative votes may be required: 
                  (1)  No action to modify the Whitfield County budget after its initial adoption shall be taken without the affirmative vote of at least four members of the board of commissioners. 
                  (2)  No action to add items to any regular business meeting agenda shall be taken without the unanimous affirmative vote of all members of the board of commissioners present and voting at that meeting. 
                  (3)  No action to go into executive session for any purpose allowed pursuant to Georgia law shall be taken without the unanimous affirmative vote of all members of the board of commissioners present and voting at that meeting. 
                  (f)  The chair, at his or her option for any matter, may exercise the same voting rights as other members of the board upon questions considered by the board, or the chair may choose not to vote, except that the chair shall vote in order to break a tie among the voting members of the board.

                  (a)  Call to order. If, at the time of a meeting, the chair determines that all commissioners have been notified or a bona fide attempt has been made to notify all commissioners and that a quorum of the board is present, he or she shall have the authority to call the meeting to order. The call to order shall not require any preceding action but may be instituted solely by the authority of the chair. 
                  (b)  Motions; general requirement. The board of commissioners may take action only when a motion to take such action is made and passed by the board. 
                  (1)  Procedure. 
                  a.  Before a motion may be discussed or voted upon by the board of commissioners, it must be presented by a member of the board. The presentment is made by clearly stating the motion. 
                  b.  Immediately after a motion is presented to the board by a commissioner, the chair shall ask whether any other commissioner desires to second the motion. If the motion is not seconded, it shall fail for lack of a second and shall not be remade until, at the soonest, the next meeting of the board, except as otherwise provided herein. 
                  c.  If the motion is seconded, the chair shall immediately ask whether there is discussion of the motion. Discussion of the motion shall be limited to the board of commissioners and shall relate solely to the motion at hand; however, with the permission of the chair, any commissioner may question a member of the audience or staff provided such question shall pertain strictly to the motion at hand. 
                  d.  Upon the conclusion of discussion, the chair shall cause the motion to be restated and shall then call the question. 
                  (2)  Amendment. 
                  a.  An amendment to any pending motion may be suggested by any member of the board. The amendment shall be suggested only during the discussion of the original motion. 
                  b.  A motion may be amended only with the consent of the commissioner making the motion. If the commissioner who seconded the original motion disagrees with the amendment, he or she shall be allowed to withdraw the second. When a second is withdrawn, the chair shall immediately request whether there is a new second to the amended motion. 
                  c.  After a motion is amended and seconded, the chair shall call for discussion and proceed with the consideration of the motion in the manner provided above. 
                  (3)  Withdrawal. 
                  a.  Any motion may be withdrawn at the discretion of the commissioner making the motion. 
                  b.  Motions may be withdrawn at any time prior to, but neither during nor after, the re-stating of the motion by the chair. 
                  (4)  Postponement. 
                  a.  During the discussion of any motion, the motion may be postponed (often erroneously called "tabling") for further discussion by the board upon the motion of any commissioner other than the commissioner who made the original motion. 
                  b.  The motion to table shall specify the time and place for the continued discussion. 
                  c.  Discussion of the original motion shall immediately cease when a motion to table is made and seconded. 
                  d.  A motion to postpone shall allow for discussion, if any, restating the motion, and a call of the question. 
                  (5)  Reconsideration. 
                  a.  A motion, which has been passed or defeated, or which fails for lack of a second, may be reconsidered by the board of commissioners during the same meeting provided the board passes a separate motion for reconsideration. Otherwise, the original motion may not be presented to the board again any sooner than its next meeting.

                  DIVISION 3. - FIXED ASSETS RECORD SYSTEM 

                  Sec. 2-180. - Introduction. 
                  (1)  Definition. "Fixed assets" are defined as property belonging to Whitfield County. Items meeting all of the following criteria are recorded on the fixed asset record system: 
                  (a)  Items with a cost of $10,000.00 or more; 
                  (b)  Items with a useful life of at least one year or more; 
                  (c)  Items physically tangible. 
                  These items are usually vehicles, equipment, furniture, and office equipment. The list, however, is exhaustive. Fixed assets may be further defined as capital and non-capital acquisitions made through purchase, donation, seizure, and/or construction for use in day-to-day operations. They are owned by Whitfield County and are intended for use by Whitfield County in service to its citizens. 
                  (2)  Purpose. The primary purpose for recording fixed assets is to ensure stewardship of Whitfield County assets. Detailed and timely fixed asset records demonstrate accountability. Accurate and complete records provide a deterrent to lost or stolen assets and a basis for periodic inventory of those assets. Accurate fixed asset records are necessary in developing comprehensive risk management programs. Quality fixed asset records contribute to accurate financial statements and an unqualified audit opinion. Inadequate fixed asset records could lead to accidental violations of grant programs. Fixed asset records can supply cost estimates and replacement needs during the capital budget process. Asset replacement and enhancement cannot be properly planned without adequate fixed asset records. 
                  The purpose of this manual is to define and describe a set of standard procedures and policies required to record and control the changes in the fixed asset system of Whitfield County. This is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
                  (3)  Scope. All items meeting one or more of the fixed asset criteria are recorded on the fixed asset record system. Assets with an acquisition cost of $1,000.00 or more are recorded in the annual financial report of Whitfield County. 
                  (4)  Users. The primary users of the fixed asset system include, but are not limited to the following: 
                  (a)  Department heads. 
                  (b)  Board of commissioners—Administrator's office accounting division. 
                  (c)  Internal or external auditors. 
                  The fixed asset record system is maintained in a manner which facilitates ease of use by users. 
                  (5)  Responsibility. Department heads have direct responsibility of all fixed assets purchased for, assigned to or otherwise provided to their department. This includes the legal and ethical obligation of their staff to provide sufficient care and safekeeping of fixed assets. Custodial responsibility obligates the department to give reasonable protection against theft, vandalism, misuse, and destruction of assigned fixed assets. Department heads will be given a quarterly report containing fixed assets assigned to their departments. It is the responsibility of the department heads to review this report and verify the accuracy of the report. If one of the assets on the report is not in the department, it is the departments' responsibility to notify the accounting division immediately. Fixed assets are not to be removed from assigned locations without the permission of the department head. 
                  The accounting division is responsible for administering the fixed asset record system. The primary mission of the accounting division involvement in fixed asset management is to maintain complete and accurate records of all transactions related to the acquisition, use, and eventual disposition of fixed assets. The accounting division is also responsible for reconciliation of fixed asset transactions to the general ledger, implementation and correction of internal audit findings as a result of physical inventory, and presentation of fixed asset data in the Whitfield County Annual Financial Report. 
                  All assets identified as no longer usable by departments are declared surplus. All departments have an opportunity to inspect surplus assets for possible use before they are sold or otherwise disposed. This helps to avoid duplication and unnecessary purchase of assets. Exceptions to this are obsolete, traded, dismantled, donated, and individual sale. 
                  The internal auditor conducts an annual physical inventory of fixed assets. All fixed assets are subject to audit during this process. Internal audit has all responsibility for the physical inventory. This includes scope, timing and all other phases of the physical inventory process. 
                  (Mo. of 12-10-01; Ord. of 12-15-08(1), § 1) 
                  Sec. 2-181. - Acquisition. 
                  Fixed assets can be acquired by Whitfield County in any of the following ways: 
                  (1)  Purchase. This is defined as regular acquisitions of nonconsumable and nonexpendable items with a useful life of at least one year and an acquisition cost of $1,000.00 or more. Fixed assets acquired by purchase are recorded at historical cost. Historical cost is defined as consideration or money given or received. Historical cost also includes any other reasonable and necessary costs incurred to place the asset in its intended location and use. 
                  (2)  Gifts or donations. These are defined as acquisitions from outside agencies, companies or individuals. Normally there is no monetary cost for acquiring these assets. They must meet fixed asset criteria before being recorded on the fixed asset record system. Gifts or donations are recorded at fair market value on the date of acquisition by Whitfield County. Fair market value is the estimated amount at which the fixed asset might exchange between a willing buyer and willing seller. Independent appraisal is used to determine fair market value. In the event this is not feasible or available, the accounting division will determine the fair market value by using average costing. 
                  (3)  Seizure. This is defined as the legal acquisition or condemnation of items awarded to Whitfield County departments/divisions by the courts. Fixed assets acquired through legal seizure or exercise of eminent domain is recorded at the amount expended to the previous owner in the legal process. 
                  (4)  Renovations or improvements. These are defined as betterment's to existing assets that meet fixed asset criteria. Renovation or improvements to existing assets are recorded at the end of each fiscal year. The renovation is recorded as a separate asset on the automated fixed asset record keeping system and shown to be connected to the original asset. Costs considered to be repair and maintenance are recorded as operating expenses. To help distinguish between repair and maintenance or improvements, a 20 percent test is used. If the expenditure for the renovation or improvement is not greater than 20 percent of the original cost of the improved asset, the expenditure will be considered repair and maintenance. 
                  (5)  Construction or fabrication. This is defined as the assembly of assets by Whitfield County or outside companies or individuals for use in the day to day operations of Whitfield County. Constructed assets are recorded at the cost of construction. Construction of major assets may span two or more fiscal years. In this event, the cost of construction is capitalized into construction in progress until construction is complete. 
                  (6)  Found. These are defined as items discovered in the day-to-day operations of Whitfield County or during the annual physical inventory. Their historical cost is normally estimated by the accounting division. 
                  (Mo. of 12-10-01) 
                  Sec. 2-182. - Tagging of fixed assets. 
                  The primary purpose of tagging fixed assets is to maintain a positive identification of assets owned by Whitfield County. Other purposes are to provide an accurate method of identifying individual assets and to facilitate the physical inventory process. 
                  Serialized tags are pre-numbered sequentially and used to tag assets that meet fixed asset criteria. The accounting division has the responsibility of tagging fixed assets with serialized tags within 60 days of payment for an asset. 
                  Whitfield County follows the suggested tag locations set forth in Government Fixed Asset Inventory Systems edited by Paul E. Glick. In the absence of a specific listing for a type of asset, the tag is placed close to the manufacturer's ID plate. In the absence of an ID plate, the tag is placed in an easily readable and accessible location. 
                  (Mo. of 12-10-01) 
                  Sec. 2-183. - Transfers of fixed assets. 
                  Transfers are defined as any movement of an asset by virtue of change in location. Transfers can occur between different departments. Fixed asset transfers require the authorization of the effected department heads. Assets can be transferred by loan or permanent movement. Each type of transfer is explained further below. 
                  A loan occurs when a fixed asset is being used temporarily by a department other than the department having responsibility for the asset. In the event of a loan, the department will complete a fixed asset transaction document (Form 02) and forward it to the accounting division prior to physical movement of the fixed asset. In the event of a loan, the loaner department or division will remain on the fixed asset record system. The loanee department or division will be listed in the location and building code sections on the fixed asset record system. 
                  The permanent movement of an asset between departments or divisions is reported by the completion of a fixed asset transaction document (Form 02). The form is completed and forwarded to the accounting division before the asset is physically moved. 
                  Requests for the physical movement of fixed assets in the event of transfer are the responsibility of the department. 
                  (Mo. of 12-10-01) 
                  Sec. 2-184. - Disposals of fixed assets. 
                  (a)  The board of commissioners of Whitfield County prior to disposal must approve all disposals of fixed assets. After approval a fixed asset disposition document (Form 01) is completed and forwarded to the accounting division by the department. Once the assets are sold, the disposal is entered on the fixed asset record system. 
                  (b)  Fixed assets may be disposed in [the following] six ways: 
                  (1)  Auction. This is defined as the sale of surplus or obsolete assets that have been inspected by other department/divisions for possible use and are now being held for sale in the surplus warehouse. This is the most common method used for disposal of Whitfield County fixed assets. The accounting division removes fixed asset tags prior to sale, prepares a revenue allocation worksheet by fund, and disposes sold assets on the fixed asset record system. To dispose of assets sold at auction on the fixed asset record system, the accounting division uses the auction list previously approved by the commission. This serves as authorization to remove the assets from the record system. The accounting division may need to count assets in surplus after auction for verification. The internal auditor is notified if this need arises. 
                  (2)  Stolen. This is defined as fixed assets removed from a location without permission. 
                  (3)  Donations. This is defined as donations of assets to other person or agencies. A copy of the minutes of the board of commissioners meeting approving the donation of Whitfield County fixed assets is required. 
                  (4)  Sale other than auctions. This is defined as an individual sale other than auction of fixed assets. For example, the sale of a piece of equipment to another government agency. The accounting division is notified prior to the sale. The board of commissioners approval is required. 
                  (5)  Dismantling. This is defined as the breakdown of fixed assets for alternate use. For example, a lawnmower is dismantled for parts. The accounting division is notified prior to the dismantling. 
                  (6)  Trade-in. This is defined as assets traded for other assets. Since the trade-in is equal to the disposition of a fixed asset, the board of commissioners approval is required. The accounting division is notified prior to the trade-in. 
                  For accounting purposes, the newly acquired asset is to be recorded at the cost without allowance for trade-in. 
                  (Mo. of 12-10-01) 
                  Sec. 2-185. - Physical inventory. 
                  A physical inventory of fixed assets is conducted annually by the internal auditor. The scope of the inventory is determined by the internal auditor and is subject to change with each audit. All fixed assets are subject to audit. Assets being held in surplus are also subject to audit during this process. 
                  Once the physical inventory is complete, internal audit will issue a report detailing the findings and recommendations of the audit. The accounting division is responsible for implementing the recommendations and answering the findings of the physical inventory if possible. 
                  (Mo. of 12-10-01) 
                  Sec. 2-186. - Sensitive assets. 
                  Sensitive assets are those assets that may not meet the fixed asset criteria but need to be included on fixed asset records. The need for inclusion is based on the sensitive, portable or theft prone nature of the asset. These assets are not recorded on the fixed asset record system, but are maintained at the department level. They are given an unserialized tag with the heading "Property of Whitfield County". They include radios, electronic equipment and printers. 
                  For this purpose, radios are defined as public safety radio equipment. Desktop radios are not included. Electronic equipment is defined as television sets, video cassette recorders, and cameras. Printers are defined as computer related printers. 
                  (Mo. of 12-10-01) 
                  Sec. 2-187. - Items not considered fixed assets. 
                  There are items that meet fixed asset criteria that are not recorded on the fixed asset record system. The inclusion of these items creates inaccuracy and does not contribute to the overall purpose of fixed asset record keeping as outlined on page 1 of the fixed assets record keeping manual [on file in the county clerks office]. The items that fall into this category are as follows: 
                  (1)  Light bars. 
                  (2)  Traffic lights. 
                  (3)  Computer software. 
                  (4)  Infrastructure. 
                  (5)  Inventory parts. 
                  (6)  Repair and maintenance items. 
                  Light bars refer to the lighting systems for public safety vehicles. Computer software refers to mainframe software, server software, personal computer software, or any other software that will remain in the permanent custody Whitfield County Information Technology Department. Inventory parts refer to parts inventories maintained by public works and fire department. These inventories are considered consumable.

                  (6)  Where there is evidence that alcoholic beverages have been sold to an intoxicated person or to a minor. 
                  (7)  Where there is evidence that the conducting of the business creates a disturbance, congregation of intoxicated persons, congregation of minors, allows minors to purchase, drink or possess alcoholic beverages on the premises, or causes the police to answer complaints or make extra surveillance of the premises.

                  d.  If applicant's spouse shall not be able to meet the qualifications of an applicant, particularly if it appears that the applicant's spouse or another person is using the applicant as a guise or "dummy" to obtain a license. 
                  (9)  Where there is evidence of prior arrest or conviction of any of the employees at the location of the licensee. 
                  (10)  Any material omission, or untrue or misleading information contained in or left out of an original, renewal, or transfer application for a license hereunder shall be cause for the denial thereof; and if any license has previously been granted under these circumstances, such shall constitute cause for the revocation of same. 
                  (b)  A violation of this or any other section of this chapter shall authorize the board of commissioners to suspend, revoke or place on probation, with or without conditions, the license or holder.

                  (Code 1979, § 7-3-43(a)) 
                  Sec. 3-53. - Same—"Due cause" procedure. 
                  (a)  No license which has been issued or which may hereafter be issued by the county to any retail dealer or wholesale dealer shall be suspended or revoked, except for due cause as hereinafter defined, and after a hearing and upon written notice to the holder of such license of the time, place and purpose of such hearing and a statement of the charge upon which such hearing shall be held. Three days' notice shall be deemed reasonable, but shorter or longer periods of notice shall be authorized as the board of commissioners may deem the circumstances to justify. "Due cause" for the suspension or revocation of such license shall consist of the violation of any law or ordinance regulating such business or for the violation of any state or federal law, or for any change in the area where such business is located, which change is deemed by the board of commissioners to cause such business in such area to be undesirable, or when the board of commissioners deems the operation or operators of such business to be undesirable, or any reason which would authorize the board of commissioners to refuse the issuance of a license, or any violation of this chapter. 
                  (b)  The chairman of the board of commissioners shall suspend a license or give three days' notice that such license is subject to suspension when there is cause to believe that grounds exist for revoking a license. This action shall be reviewed at the next regular meeting of the board of commissioners, or, at the request of the license holder, a special meeting of the board of commissioners may be called within three days after such request is filed with the county administrator to affirm or to refuse the suspension after the hearing of the evidence. An accusation by a law enforcement officer shall be deemed due and sufficient cause for suspension. A license shall not be revoked except upon action by the board of commissioners, except pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c) of this section. 
                  (c)  (1)  By accepting a license hereunder, the licensee agrees that the sheriff's department of this county or other duly authorized law enforcement officer, upon violation of this chapter or a state law being committed in the presence of or upon information to the sheriff's department or any other duly authorized law enforcement officer, may remove from the wall of the licensed premises the license granted. The license shall be returned to the sheriff with a full report for the reasons for the removal. The sheriff's office shall within 24 hours check the facts and circumstances of the removal, and may, at the officer's discretion return the license pending a hearing thereon. Within 72 hours thereafter, the sheriff shall make a full report in writing with recommendations to the clerk of the board of commissioners together with the action such officer has taken and a recommendation as to whether or not the license should be revoked or suspended and the reasons therefor. 
                  (2)  If the report shall recommend suspension or revocation of the license, a hearing shall be set with the clerk of the board of commissioners and be held before the clerk with a record to be made of the proceedings, at a date not over ten days from the original seizure of the license. A notice shall be given at least three days prior to the hearing, unless waived by the holder of the license, and shall be served either personally upon the licensee, or in the event the licensee is not to be found, by leaving the same at the licensee's place of business. The hearing shall be in the nature of a show cause hearing, the licensee to show why the license should not be suspended or revoked. After a hearing and during the period, the license, if not returned by the sheriff, shall be held by the county and the alcoholic beverage business shall not be operated during such period of time. 
                  (3)  After the hearing the clerk shall make a recommendation to the board of commissioners with findings and reasons therefor that either the licensee shall keep or have returned the license or that the license shall be suspended or revoked, and the board of commissioners shall take action upon the recommendation at its next regular meeting.

                  Sec. 3-54. - Same—Automatic revocation. 
                  Whenever a state shall revoke any permit or license to manufacture or sell at wholesale or retail any malt beverages or wine, the county license to deal in such products shall thereupon be automatically revoked without any action by the board of commissioners.

                  Sec. 3-55. - Same—Removal of signs; no fee refund. 
                  (a)  When any license for selling beverages is revoked, all signs indicating that such beverage may be sold or purchased shall be removed from the place of business, both outside and inside. Upon receipt by the sheriff of notice of such revocation, the sheriff shall take the necessary steps to see that this section is enforced. 
                  (b)  In the event of revocation by the board of commissioners, the licensee shall not be entitled to a return of the unearned license fee. 
                  (Code 1979, §§ 7-3-46, 7-3-61, 7-3-81(c); Ord. of 10-13-03, § 16) 
                  Sec. 3-56. - Restrictions upon transfers. 
                  Licenses hereunder shall not be transferable, as to location or ownership, except upon approval of the board of commissioners subject to the following: 
                  (1)  In case of the death of any person holding such a license or any interest therein, the same may, in the discretion of the board of commissioners, be transferred to the personal representative or the lawful heirs of the deceased person. 
                  (2)  Nothing in this section, however, shall prohibit one or more of the partners in a partnership holding a license to withdraw from the partnership in favor of one or more of the partners, who were partners at the time of the issuance of the license. Such a withdrawal shall not, however, serve to bring any new ownership into the partnership. 
                  (3)  Should a transfer of a location be approved, there shall be no pro rata return of any license fee and the new location shall be considered under, and meet the requirements of, a new license hereunder; provided, however, that where a transfer of an existing location is approved and there is no change in the ownership of the business, the license fee paid for the old location shall be applied to the new location.

Such certificate shall not be issued until all required electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing and fire protection systems have been inspected for compliance with the technical codes and other applicable laws and ordinances and released by the building inspector. 
                  2.  Issuing certificate of occupancy. Upon satisfactory completion of construction of a building or structure and installation of electrical, gas, mechanical and plumbing systems in accordance with the technical codes, reviewed plans and specifications, and after the final inspection, the building inspector shall issue a certificate of occupancy stating the nature of the occupancy permitted, the number of persons for each floor when limited by law, and the allowable load per square foot for each floor in accordance with the provisions of the technical codes. 
                  3.  Temporary/partial occupancy. A temporary/partial certificate of occupancy may be issued for a portion of a building which may safely be occupied prior to final completion of the building. 
                  4.  Existing building certificate of occupancy. A certificate of occupancy for any existing building may be obtained by applying to the building inspector and supplying the information and data necessary to determine compliance with the technical codes for the occupancy intended. Where necessary, in the opinion of the building inspector, two sets of detailed drawings, or a general inspection, or both, may be required. When, upon examination and inspection, it is found that the building conforms to the provisions of the technical codes and other applicable laws and ordinances for such occupancy, a certificate of occupancy shall be issued. 
                  (b)  Certificate of completion. Upon satisfactory completion of a building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system, a certificate of completion may be issued. This certificate is proof that a structure or system is complete and for certain types of permits is released for use and may be connected to a utility system. The certificate does not grant authority to occupy or connect a building such as a shell building prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
                  (c)  Service utilities. 
                  1.  Connection of service utilities. No person shall make connections from a utility source of energy, fuel or power to any building or system which is regulated by the technical codes for which a permit is required, until released by the building inspector and a certificate of occupancy or completion is issued. 
                  2.  Temporary connection. The building inspector may authorize the temporary connection of the building or system to the utility source of energy, fuel or power for the purpose of testing building service systems or for use under a temporary certificate of occupancy. 
                  3.  Authority to disconnect service utilities. The building inspector shall have the power to authorize disconnection of utility service to the building structure or system regulated by the technical codes, in case of emergency where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to life or property. The building inspector shall notify the serving utility, and whenever possible the owner and occupant of the building structure or service system of the decision to disconnect prior to taking such action. If not notified prior to disconnecting, the owner or occupant of the building structure or service system shall be notified in writing, as soon as practical thereafter. 
                  (d)  Posting floor loads. 
                  1.  Occupancy. An existing or new building shall not be occupied for any purpose which will cause the floors thereof to be loaded beyond their safe capacity. The building inspector may permit occupancy of a building for mercantile, commercial or industrial purposes, by a specific business, when he is satisfied that such capacity will not thereby be exceeded. 
                  2.  Storage and factory-industrial occupancies. It shall be the responsibility of the owner, agent, proprietor or occupant of group S and group F occupancies, or any occupancy where excessive floor loading is likely to occur, to employ a competent architect or engineer in computing the safe load capacity. All such computations shall be accompanied by an affidavit from the architect or engineer stating the safe allowable floor load on each floor in pounds per square foot is uniformly distributed. The computations and affidavit shall be filed as a permanent record of the building inspector. 
                  3.  Signs required. In every building or part of a building used for storage, industrial or hazardous purposes, the safe floor loads, as reviewed by the building inspector on the plan, shall be marked on plates or approved design which shall be supplied and securely affixed by the owner of the building in a conspicuous place in each story to which they relate. Such plates shall not be removed or defaced, and if lost, removed or defaced, shall be replaced by the owner of the building.

                  (b)  Terms. The terms of office of the board member shall be staggered so no more than one-third of the board is appointed or replaced in any 12-month period. Vacancies shall be filed for an unexpired term in the manner in which original appointments are required to be made. Continued absence of any member from required meetings of the board shall, at the discretion of the Whitfield County Board of Commissioners, render any such member subject to immediate removal from office. 
                  (c)  Quorum and voting. A simple majority of the board shall constitute a quorum. In varying any provision of this Code, the affirmative votes of the majority present shall be required. In modifying a decision of the building inspector, not less than two affirmative votes shall be required. 
                  (d)  Secretary of board. The building inspector shall act as secretary of the board and shall make a detailed record of all its proceedings, which shall set forth the reasons for its decision, the vote of each member, the absence of a member and any failure of a member to vote. 
                  (3)  Powers. The construction board of adjustment and appeals shall have the power, as further defined in subsection (4) to hear the appeals of decisions and interpretations of the building inspector and consider variances of the technical codes.

                  3.  That an equally good or more desirable form of installation can be employed in any specific use. 
                  4.  The true intent and meaning of this Code or any of the regulations thereunder have been misconstrued or incorrectly interpreted. 
                  (b)  Variances. The construction board of adjustment and appeals, when so appealed to and after a hearing, may vary the application of any provision of this Code to a particular case when, in its opinion, the enforcement thereof would do manifest injustice and would be contrary to the spirit and purpose of this Code or the technical codes or public interest, and also finds all of the following: 
                  1.  That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the building, structure or service system involved and which are not applicable to others. 
                  2.  That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the action inaction of the applicant. 
                  3.  That granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this Code to other buildings, structures or service system. 
                  4.  That the variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the building, structure or service system. 
                  5.  The granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of this Code and will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare. In granting the variance, the construction board of adjustment and appeals may prescribe a reasonable time limit within which the action for which the variance is required shall be commenced or completed or both. In addition, the construction board of adjustment and appeals may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Code. Violation of the conditions of a variance shall be deemed a violation of this Code. 
                  (c)  Notice of appeal. Notice of appeal shall be in writing, and filed within 30 calendar days after the decision is rendered by the building inspector. Appeals shall be in a form acceptable to the building inspector. 
                  (d)  Unsafe or dangerous buildings or service systems. In the case of a building, structure, or service system which, in the opinion of the building inspector, in unsafe, unsanitary or dangerous, the building inspector may, in his order, limit the time for such notice of appeals to a shorter period. 
                  (5)  Rules and regulations. 
                  (a)  Procedures. The construction board of adjustment and appeals shall establish rules and regulations for its own procedures not inconsistent with the provisions of these procedures. The construction board of adjustment and appeals shall meet on call of the chairman. The construction board of adjustment and appeals shall meet within 30 calendar days after notice of appeal has been received. 
                  (b)  Decisions. The construction board of adjustment and appeals shall, in every case, reach a decision without unreasonable or unnecessary delay. Each decision of the construction board of adjustment and appeals shall also include the reasons for the decision. If a decision of the construction board of adjustment and appeals reverses or modifies a refusal, order, or disallowance of the building inspector or varies the application of any provision of this Code, the building inspector shall immediately take action in accordance with such decision. Every decision shall be promptly filed in writing in the office of the building inspector and shall be open to public inspection. A certified copy of the decision shall be sent by mail or otherwise to the appellant and a copy shall be kept publicly posted in the office of the building inspector for two weeks after filing. Every decision of the board shall be final, subject however to such remedy as any aggrieved party might have at law or in equity.

                  Sec. 5-49. - Appeals and variances. 
                  All appeals and variances from any decision of the county engineer or his or her designee relating to any requirement of this article shall be heard by the Whitfield County Unified Board of Zoning Appeals upon such procedures as follows. The board of zoning appeals shall be empowered to grant variances where appropriate, upon the conditions therefor set forth in the following: 
                  (a)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (b)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (c)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (d)  In reviewing such requests, the board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (e)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this section are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The county engineer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (f)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  Sec. 5-72. - Exemptions. 
                  This article shall apply to any land-disturbing activity undertaken by any person on any land except for the following: 
                  (1)  Surface mining, as the same is defined in O.C.G.A. § 12-4-72, "The Georgia Surface Mining Act of 1968." 
                  (2)  Granite quarrying and land clearing for such quarrying; 
                  (3)  Such minor land-disturbing activities as home gardens and individual home landscaping, repairs, maintenance work, fences, and other related activities which result in minor soil erosion; 
                  (4)  The construction of single-family residences, when such construction disturbs less than one acre and is not a part of a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre and not otherwise exempted under this paragraph; provided, however, that construction of any such residence shall conform to the minimum requirements as set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 and this paragraph. For single-family residence construction covered by the provisions of this paragraph, there shall be a buffer zone between the residence and any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. In any such buffer zone, no land-disturbing activity shall be constructed between the residence and the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action from the banks of the trout waters. For primary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. For secondary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, but the Director may grant variances to no less than 25 feet. Regardless of whether a trout stream is primary or secondary, for first order trout waters, which are streams into which no other streams flow except for springs, the buffer shall be at least 25 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. The minimum requirements of subsection (b) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 and the buffer zones provided by this section shall be enforced by the local issuing authority; 
                  (5)  Agricultural operations as defined in O.C.G.A. § 1-3-3, "definitions", to include raising, harvesting or storing of products of the field or orchard; feeding, breeding or managing livestock or poultry; producing or storing feed for use in the production of livestock, including but not limited to cattle, calves, swine, hogs, goats, sheep, and rabbits or for use in the production of poultry, including but not limited to chickens, hens and turkeys; producing plants, trees, fowl, or animals; the production of aqua culture, horticultural, dairy, livestock, poultry, eggs and apiarian products; farm buildings and farm ponds; 
                  (6)  Forestry land management practices, including harvesting; provided, however, that when such exempt forestry practices cause or result in land-disturbing or other activities otherwise prohibited in a buffer, as established in paragraphs (15) and (16) of section 5-73(c), no other land-disturbing activities, except for normal forest management practices, shall be allowed on the entire property upon which the forestry practices were conducted for a period of three years after completion of such forestry practices; 
                  (7)  Any project carried out under the technical supervision of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) of the United States Department of Agriculture; 
                  (8)  Any project involving less than one acre of disturbed area; provided, however, that this exemption shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity within a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre or within 200 feet of the bank of any state waters, and for purposes of this paragraph, "state waters" excludes channels and drainage ways which have water in them only during and immediately after rainfall events and intermittent streams which do not have water in them year-round; provided, however, that any person responsible for a project which involves less than one acre, which involves land-disturbing activity, and which is within 200 feet of any such excluded channel or drainage way, must prevent sediment from moving beyond the boundaries of the property on which such project is located and provided, further, that nothing contained herein shall prevent the local issuing authority from regulating any such project which is not specifically exempted by paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (9) or (10) of this subsection; 
                  (9)  Construction or maintenance projects, or both, undertaken or financed in whole or in part, or both, by the Department of Transportation, the Georgia Highway Authority, or the State Road and Tollway Authority; or any road construction or maintenance project, or both, undertaken by any county or municipality; provided, however, that construction or maintenance projects of the Department of Transportation or the State Road and Tollway Authority which disturb one or more contiguous acres of land shall be subject to provisions of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7.1; except where the Department of Transportation, the Georgia Highway Authority, or the State Road and Tollway Authority is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state general permit, in which case a copy of a notice of intent under the state general permit shall be submitted to the local issuing authority, the local issuing authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders; 
                  (10)  Any land-disturbing activities conducted by any electric membership corporation or municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the public service commission, any utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as defined in O.C.G.A. § 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United States engaged in the generation, transmission, or distribution of power; except where an electric membership corporation or municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the public service commission, any utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as defined in O.C.G.A. § 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United states engaged in the generation, transmission, or distribution of power is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state general permit, in which case the local issuing authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders; and 
                  (11)  Any public water system reservoir. 
                  (Ord. of 12-12-16(1); Ord. of 12-11-17(1)) 
                  Sec. 5-73. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this ordinance shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c). The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this ordinance and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in this subsection and subsection (c) of this ordinance shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the Director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land- disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsection c (15), (16) and (17), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (6)  Construction site operators must control waste at the construction site, such as discarded building materials, concrete washout, chemicals, litter and sanitary waste. 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1, et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  (i)  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  (ii)  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50 foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25 foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  (i)  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  (ii)  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (17)  There is established a 25 foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to Code Section 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to Code section 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this act and if the requirement to maintain a 25 foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this chapter or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. of 12-12-16(1); Ord. of 12-11-17(1)) 
                  Sec. 5-74. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this chapter, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of Whitfield County without first obtaining a permit from the county engineer (erosion/stormwater inspections) office to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to county engineer (erosion/stormwater inspections office) and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 5-73(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition [to] local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8 (a), half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the Division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. A copy of the notice of intent submitted to the State of Georgia shall also be submitted the local issuing authority. Secondary permittees shall provide to Whitfield County a copy of any such notice of intent submitted to the State of Georgia when applying for a building permit. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 5-73(15), (16) and (17), has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection 5-74 (b)(6) have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this chapter, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this chapter or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 5-73(b) and (c) of this chapter, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this chapter.

Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing.

The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this chapter, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this chapter or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this chapter shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day.

                  Sec. 5-164. - Address administrator. 
                  All addressing functions shall be centralized in the office of the Whitfield County Address Administrator, who shall serve by appointment by the Whitfield County Administrator.

                  (Ord. of 6-1-10(2), § 1) 
                  Sec. 5-165. - Discrepancies.

                  (Ord. of 6-1-10(2), § 1) 
                  Sec. 5-166. - Address number assignment. 
                  Address assignment shall be based upon the type descriptions listed below. Addresses shall be supplied only for habitable structures and devices with existing telephone service. Addresses for proposed habitable structures not within major subdivisions (as defined by Whitfield County Code of Ordinances, section 15-21(3)) will be provided only after the final location of ingress and egress to the structure and the final location of the structure are evident on the ground so that the correct and final GPS location of the structure, as an access point can be located. An address will be provided for all final building permit applications. Addresses for proposed structures within major subdivisions may be provided after final plat approval has been obtained. Devices with telephone service will be provided an address when permanent position of the device can be located using GPS. The address administrator shall have the authority to assign and to correct addresses not in compliance with this article. Appeals of any decision by the addressing administrator shall be heard and decided by the committee, as set forth in section 5-163(c)(6). 
                  (a)  Frontage interval address style. Address numbers shall be assigned to each structure, as defined herein, a "location number" based upon its distance (i.e., the number of 10.56-foot segments) from the origin point of the road to the center point of the access drive. 
                  (b)  Odd/even number location. Numbers are odd on the left hand side of the road and even on the right side of the road as the numbers increase. 
                  (c)  Fractional, alphanumeric, hyphenated addresses. There shall be no use of fractional addresses, alphanumeric address numbers or hyphenated address numbers. This provision shall apply to apartment numbers and suite numbers as well as to secondary location indicators such as apartment numbers and suite number. 
                  (d)  Component order. Components of a road address shall always be in the following order: address number, directional prefix (if any), road name and road type, designation of apartment or suite, and apartment/suite number. 
                  (e)  Diagonal roads. Diagonal roads shall be treated as either north-south or east-west roads. Once orientation is established it shall be used throughout the entire length of the road. The orientation will not change even if the road changes direction. Within developments it is advisable to consider the direction of the beginning of the road. 
                  (f)  Circular roads. A circular road is one that returns to the same origin point or to the same originating road. Circular roads shall be numbered beginning at the low numbered intersection and continuing to the other end of the road. The outside of the circle is numbered first and the inside is then numbered to match and mix with the outside. This will result, in most cases, with fewer numbers on the inside of the circle and with larger spaces between the inside numbers. Numbering sequence of the outside and inside of the circle shall be used throughout the entire length of the road retaining odd/even designations on the appropriate side of the circular road. 
                  (g)  Culs-de-Sac. Culs-de-sac shall be addressed using the system based on the baseline/meridian structure; odd/even numbers on the appropriate sides of the road and meeting at the mid-point, or the back of the cul-de-sac. 
                  (h)  Corner lots. It is preferable for corner lots to be addressed to the road off which the driveway is accessed. However, corner lots have the option of being addressed to the driveway or the front of the structure. Display of address numbers on the structure shall face the road to which the home is addressed. The assigned address will be determined by the site plan presented at the time a building permit is requested. 
                  (i)  Private drives/easements. Private drives/easements may be addressed to an existing adjoining road when they serve no more than two lots or structures. Private drives and easements serving more than two lots or structures shall be addressed to the private drive/easement. 
                  (j)  Single-family dwellings. A single-family dwelling shall receive its own individual address determined by the basic rules for distance and direction. 
                  (k)  Duplexes/apartment residences/office buildings/strip commercial buildings. Structures of this type shall be numbered with the main building receiving one address and each individual unit being assigned unit/suite numbers as secondary location indicators. The unit number assigned should indicate the floor location (e.g., "Unit 204" is the fourth unit on the second floor). Alphanumeric numbers are not permitted. Buildings with multiple entrances, where each entrance provides access to a limited number of units, shall require an address for each individual entrance. Careful planning shall be taken to reserve enough numbers for future divisions of units/suites. 
                  (l)  Mobile/manufactured home parks. Each individual mobile home or manufactured home shall be assigned its own individual address following the basic rules for distance and direction. This generally results in leaving four to eight numbers between adjacent sites. 
                  (m)  Townhouses. Townhouses individually owned and not part of an apartment complex shall be assigned an individual address for each unit as determined by the street allowing main access to the building and following the basic rules for distance and direction. Townhouses under the apartment category will be addressed as apartments, with the main building receiving one address and each individual townhouse being assigned apartment numbers as secondary locators. 
                  (n)  Condominiums. Condominiums shall be assigned an individual address for each unit as determined by the street allowing main access to the building and following the basic rules for distance and direction. An apartment building or townhouse complex that is converted to a condominium shall be required to be addressed with an individual address for each unit. 
                  (o)  Individual commercial buildings. Individual commercial buildings shall be given one address to the road on which the driveway access is located as determined by the basic rules for distance and direction. When a business faces a main road, but is accessed from a secondary road, an address will be allowed to the main road if the primary entrance faces the main road. An individual building, housing more than one business, shall require a separate address for each unit. Suite numbers shall not be allowed. A large retail complex/superstore that houses one main retail business with additional smaller retail spaces within (e.g., Grocery store with cleaners, bank, hair salon etc.) shall be assigned one address for the use of all businesses located within the main structure. This address shall be posted on the outside of the main building in a manner that it is legible to the public as well as emergency responders. 
                  (p)  Miscellaneous/secondary structures. Outbuildings and/or utilities requiring metering or possessing land line telephone service are required to have their own individual address, generally four to six numbers from the main residence. Outbuildings having their own access drive shall be assigned an address following the basic rules for distance and direction. 
                  (q)  Wireless towers. A wireless tower shall be assigned one address determined by the basic rules for distance and direction. When additional carriers are collocated thereon, all carriers, including the first carrier, will be assigned a suite number with the address. 
                  (r)  Flag lots. Buildings obtaining access through a panhandle to a public road will be addressed to the public road to which they obtain access. If the lot contains two or more principal structures and share a common access, the access itself shall be named as a road for addressing purposes. 
                  (s)  Special case lots/parcels. Special case lots developed facing a named road with access provided by a private alley, from a side road, shall be numbered to the facing road. Individual buildings on lots created facing an unnamed driveway shall be addressed off the public street from which it gains access. If the structure is more than 150 feet from the named road or is not visible from the named road, the address number shall be displayed on the structure and at the end of the driveway or easement that provides access to the structures, and be visible and legible from all directions of travel. 
                  (Ord. of 6-1-10(2), § 1) 
                  Sec. 5-167. - Road naming. 
                  (a)  Names should be appropriate for the individual road and the area's nature and character, enhance community image, have historical, physical, aesthetic or local color perspective and shall not be vulgar, offensive, or reasonably subject to double meaning. 
                  (b)  All roads that serve three or more habitable structures shall be named regardless of whether the ownership is by public road or private road. 
                  (c)  A road name assigned by Whitfield County shall not constitute or imply acceptance of the road into the county road system. 
                  (d)  Names of living persons should be avoided. Historical references are acceptable but should not duplicate the name of any person living on the road. 
                  (e)  No two roads will be given the same name (e.g., Pine Road and Pine Lane). 
                  (f)  Roads shall have only one road name. No road shall have more than one road name nor shall one continuous route change names along the route. All addresses along that road shall contain the same road name. 
                  (g)  No two roads should have similar-sounding names (e.g. Beach Street and Peach Street) in order to assist the public in pronouncing the name in emergency situations. 
                  (h)  Road names may not be duplicated by combining two words into one word or separating one word to make two words; for example, Maple Crest Drive, Maplecrest Drive. 
                  (i)  Road names may not be duplicated by spelling out a number; for example, 6 th Street, Sixth Street. 
                  (j)  Road names which are spelled differently yet sound the same shall not be allowed; for example, Gayle Way is considered a duplication of Gail Lane, and Amy Drive is considered a duplication of Aimee Lane. 
                  (k)  Suffix designations: 
                  (1)  Major arterial road: Road, Boulevard, Avenue, Street, Parkway. 
                  (2)  Local through road: Road, Drive, Lane, Way, Avenue, Street.

                  (l)  Road abbreviations (two and three character road types) will be used in accordance to US Postal Service Publication No. 28. 
                  (m)  Prohibited road names: 
                  (1)  Road names which are difficult to pronounce or names with unconventional spelling. 
                  (2)  Road names which are over 15 characters in total length, including spaces, but not including suffixes. 
                  (3)  Road names which are similar to the name of an existing subdivision in the same addressing grid unless the street lies within that same subdivision. 
                  (n)  Extensions of existing roads should be given the same name as the road extended. 
                  (o)  Before a new road name may be used, it must be checked, approved, and reserved for use by the address administrator to avoid duplication and other conflicts with the rules listed in this section. 
                  (p)  Road naming words expressly prohibited: 
                  (1)  Oak.

Upon declaration of an emergency or disaster by the governor or chair of the board of commissioners, the affairs and business of the county may be conducted at places other than the regular or usual location, within or outside of the county, when it is not prudent, expedient or possible to conduct business at the regular location. When such meetings occur outside of the county, all actions taken by the board of commissioners shall be as valid and binding as if performed within the county. Such meetings may be called by the presiding officer or any two members of the governing body without regard to or compliance with time-consuming procedures and formalities otherwise required by law. [Note: Local legislation should be reviewed to determine whether there are restrictions upon moving the meeting location if it is only a locally declared emergency and not a state of emergency declared by the governor.] 
                  (b)  Public works contracts. Upon declaration of an emergency or disaster by the governor or chair of the board of commissioners, the board of commissioners may contract for public works without letting such contract out to the lowest, responsible bidder and without advertising and posting notification of such contract for four weeks; provided, however, that the emergency must be of such nature that immediate action is required and that the action is necessary for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare.

Upon declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor or the chair of the board of commissioners, the board of commissioners may temporarily suspend the enforcement of the ordinances of the county, or any portion thereof, where the emergency is of such nature that immediate action outside the code is required, such suspension is consistent with the protection of the public health, safety and welfare, and such suspension is not inconsistent with any federal or state statutes or regulations. 
                  (e)  Fees. Upon declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor or the chair of the board of commissioners, the board of commissioners may temporarily reduce or suspend any permit fees, application fees or other rate structures as necessary to encourage the rebuilding of the areas impacted by the disaster or emergency. The term "fees" include fees or rates charged by the county for building permits, land disturbance permits, zoning applications, special land use permits, temporary land use permits and other fees relating to the reconstruction, repair and clean-up of areas impacted by the disaster or emergency.

Upon the declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor or chair of the board of commissioners, the board of commissioners or its designees may issue temporary mobile home, trailer, recreational vehicle or other temporary dwelling structures or parks in any zoning district, even though not otherwise permitted by development code, while the primary dwelling is being repaired, provided that such temporary dwellings or parks are designed by an engineer and the plans are approved by the county health department and development services. The temporary permit shall not exceed six months in duration. In the case of a continuing hardship, and in the discretion of the board of commissioners or its designee, the permit may be extended for a period of up to an additional six months. Upon expiration of the temporary permit and/or extension, the temporary dwelling must be removed.

Each day any such entity does business in the unincorporated areas of the county without complying with this article constitutes a separate offense. 
                  (b)  The cost of registration fees in a declared emergency or disaster is fixed at $0.00 per annum. Registration is nontransferable. The cost of the emergency building permit shall be equal to the cost for a building permit under existing regulations. The permit shall only be authorized for repairs.

The waiver shall be for no more than 100 tons of solid waste per year for a particular generator. The granting of a conditional waiver does not constitute a permanent change in solid waste disposal requirements. The conditional waiver can be revoked by the board of directors of the authority if it does not meet the criteria. Waivers must be renewed annually. 
                  (c)  A permit for a conditional waiver shall be approved or denied after due consideration is given to the following criteria:

The internal policy of the generator shall include both waste reduction and recycling components. The waste reduction and recycling components must be fully implemented by the generator except that which is intended to be accomplished by the requested waiver. 
                  (2)  Whether the proposed waiver impacts negatively or positively the city and county's ability to achieve the goals of the solid waste management plan. 
                  (3)  Whether the benefits of and need for the proposed waiver are greater than any possible negative effects on the goals of the solid waste management plan.

                  (d)  Any collector granted a conditional waiver under subsection (b) must submit monthly records indicating the amount of all solid waste collected from the customer (generator) on whose behalf the waiver is requested and delivered to facilities that are not operated by the authority and the location to which this solid waste was delivered. The monthly records must be verified with scale receipts from the facility where the solid waste was delivered. 
                  (e)  Any collector granted a conditional waiver under subsection (b) must remit a fee of ten dollars per ton for all solid waste delivered to a solid waste handling facility other than a solid waste handling facility operated by the authority. The fee shall be remitted annually, on or before the thirtieth day of January, based on the scale receipts for all solid waste disposed at solid waste handling facilities that are not operated by the authority in the prior calendar year.

                  (c)  In the event that the electronic automated reporting system becomes temporarily or permanently disabled, pawnbrokers and pawnshops will be notified as soon as possible. In this event, the pawnbroker and pawnshop will be required to make records of transactions in paper form.

                  (d)  Any duly authorized law enforcement officer may, during the ordinary hours of business or any other reasonable time, inspect any pawnbroker's electronic records at the pawnbroker's place of business to ensure compliance with this section.

                  b.  Whether there are definite plans for the area to be vacated and what the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area will be. 
                  c.  Whether the building, structure or object can be moved without significant damage to its physical integrity. 
                  d.  Whether the proposed relocation area is compatible with the historical and architectural character of the building, structure, site or object. 
                  (3)  Demolition: A decision by the HPC approving or denying a certificate of appropriateness for the demolition of buildings, structures, sites, or objects shall be guided by:

                  b.  The importance of the building, structure, site, or object to the ambiance of a district; 
                  c.  The difficulty or the impossibility of reproducing such a building, structure, site, or object because of its design, texture, material, detail, or unique location;

                  g.  Whether the building, structure, site, or object prevents the earning of reasonable economic return on the property on which it is located.

                  When, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision hereof would result in exceptional practical difficulty or undue economic hardship upon any owner of a specific property, the HPC, in passing upon an application, shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to said provisions, or to interpret the meaning of said provisions, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided that such variances, modifications or interpretations remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of said provisions, so that the architectural, archaeological, or historical integrity, or character of the property be conserved, and substantial justice done.

Notice of the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness shall be sent by United States mail to the applicant and all other persons who have requested such notice in writing filed with the HPC.

The HPC may or may not suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves of the application as submitted. The applicant, if he or she so desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application not sooner than three months after denial thereof. In cases where the application involves a threat to archaeological resources or a material change in the appearance of an exterior architectural or environmental feature which would require the issuance of a grading or building permit, the HPC shall notify the building inspector or other administrative officer charged with issuing grading or building permits in writing, and the rejection of the application for a certificate of appropriateness by the HPC shall be binding upon the building inspector or other administrative officer charged with issuing grading or building permits and, in such a case, no grading or building permit shall be issued.

                  Sec. 12-21. - Purpose. 
                  The proper operation of democratic government required that public officials and employees be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that the government decisions and policy be made through proper channels of the governmental structure; that public office not be used for personal gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of these goals, a code of ethics for all county officials and employees is adopted. The purpose of this policy is to establish ethical standards of conduct for all such officials and employees by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interests of the county and by directing disclosure by such officials and employees of private financial or other interests in matters affecting the county.

                  Sec. 12-30. - Reserved. 
                  ARTICLE III. - SUBSTANCE ABUSE POLICY 

                  Sec. 12-31. - Policy established. 
                  Whitfield County is committed to providing a safe work environment and to fostering the well-being and health of its employees. That commitment is jeopardized when any county employee illegally uses drugs on the job, comes to work under their influence, possesses, distributes or sells drugs in the workplace, or abuses alcohol on the job. This policy statement shall be posted on the courthouse bulletin board and other locations within each department and otherwise made available for inspection during normal working hours. The county has established the following policy: 
                  (1)  It is a violation of county policy for any employee to use, possess, sell, trade, offer for sale, or offer to buy illegal drugs or otherwise engage in illegal use of drugs on the job. 
                  (2)  It is a violation of county policy for anyone to report to work under the influence of illegal drugs or alcohol. 
                  (3)  The consumption or possession of alcoholic beverages on county premises and all work areas is prohibited. An employee whose normal faculties are impaired due to the consumption of alcohol, or whose blood alcohol level is 0.04 or higher while on duty or while conducting county business shall be guilty of misconduct. Failure to submit to required medical or physical examinations or tests is misconduct, and is grounds for discharge or suspension, without pay, from employment. Behavior that constitutes a refusal to submit to a test includes: 
                  a.  A verbal declaration; 
                  b.  An inability to provide a sufficient urine specimen or breath sample without a valid medical explanation, as well as obstructive behavior or physical absence resulting in the inability to conduct the test; 
                  c.  Leaving the scene of an accident without justifiable explanation prior to submission to drug and alcohol testing. 
                  (4)  It is a violation of the county policy for anyone to use prescription drugs illegally. However, nothing in this policy precludes the appropriate use of legally prescribed medications. 
                  (5)  All employees are required to notify the county of any criminal drug statute conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace within five days after such conviction. Failure to comply with this provision shall result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. 
                  (Mo. of 7-12-94; Mo. of 10-8-96) 
                  Sec. 12-32. - Determination of employee as impaired. 
                  An employee reporting to work visibly impaired will be deemed unable to perform required duties and will not be allowed to work. If possible, the employee's supervisor will first seek another supervisor's opinion to confirm the employee's status. Next the supervisor will consult privately with the employee to determine the cause of the observation, including whether substance abuse has occurred. If, in the opinion of the supervisor, the employee is considered impaired, the employee will be sent to a medical facility by taxi or other safe transportation alternative, depending on the determination of the observed impairment, and accompanied by the supervisor or another employee if necessary for the purposes of drug or alcohol testing. An impaired employee will not be allowed to drive. Under no circumstances should an employee be sent home without first being tested. 
                  (Mo. of 7-12-94; Mo. of 10-8-96) 
                  Sec. 12-33. - Testing of job applicants. 
                  All job applicants at Whitfield County will undergo testing for the presence of illegal drugs as a condition of employment. Any applicant with a confirmed positive test will be denied employment. 
                  Applicants will be required to submit voluntarily to a urinalysis test at a laboratory chosen by the county, and by signing a consent agreement will release the county from liability. If the physician, official or lab personnel has reasonable suspicion to believe that the job applicant has tampered with the specimen, the applicant will not be considered for employment. 
                  The county will not discriminate against applicants for employment because of a past history of drug abuse. It is the current abuse of drugs, preventing employees from performing their jobs properly, that the county will not tolerate. 
                  Individuals who have failed a pre-employment test may initiate another inquiry with the county after a period of not shorter than six months; but they must present themselves drug-free as demonstrated by urinalysis or other test selected by the county.

                  Sec. 12-34. - Drug testing practices. 
                  (a)  Condition of employment. Whitfield County has adopted testing practices to identify employees who use illegal drugs on or off the job. The drug test to which these personnel are required to submit is substance abuse testing. One time only, prior to testing, all employees and job applicants for employment shall be given a notice of testing, and a copy of this written policy statement. It shall be a condition of employment for all employees and job applicants after employment is offered to submit to drug and alcohol testing under the following circumstances (refusal to submit may be cause for immediate dismissal): 
                  (1)  When there is reasonable suspicion to believe that an employee is using illegal drugs. The following circumstances could cause reasonable suspicion: 
                  a.  Observed drug abuse. 
                  b.  Apparent physical state of impairment. 
                  c.  Incoherent mental state. 
                  d.  Marked changes in personal behavior that are otherwise unexplainable. 
                  e.  Deteriorating work performance that is not attributable to other factors.

                  (2)  When employees are involved in on-the-job accidents where personal injury or damage to company property occurs. Post-accident testing is required when employees have caused or contributed to an on-the-job injury that resulted in a loss of work time, which means any period of time during which an employee stops performing the normal duties of employment and leaves the place of employment to seek care from a licensed medical provider. Drug and alcohol tests must be performed as soon as possible after an accident, but no longer than 32 hours for drugs and eight hours for alcohol. 
                  (3)  As part of a follow-up program of treatment for drug or alcohol abuse once the employer has been informed that the employee is again suitable for employment, the employee must test negative on the drug and alcohol screen to be reinstated and agree to further random drug testing (at least once a year for two years with no advanced notice). 
                  (4)  Job applicants. 
                  (5)  When a substance abuse test is conducted as part of a routinely scheduled employee fitness-for-duty medical examination that is part of the employer's established policy or that is scheduled routinely for all members of an employment classification or group. 
                  (b)  Collection and testing procedures. Specimen collection and testing shall be performed in accordance with the following procedures: 
                  (1)  A specimen shall be collected with due regard to the privacy of the individual providing the specimen, and in a manner reasonably calculated to prevent substitution or contamination of the specimen. 
                  (2)  Specimen collection shall be documented, and the documentation procedures shall include: 
                  a.  Labeling of specimen containers so as to reasonably preclude the likelihood of erroneous identification of test results; and 
                  b.  An opportunity for the employee or job applicant to record any information he or she considers relevant to the test, including identification of currently or recently used prescription or nonprescription medication or other relevant medical information. The providing of information shall not preclude the administration of the test, but shall be taken into account in interpreting any positive confirmed results. 
                  (3)  Specimen collection, storage, and transportation to the testing site shall be performed in a manner which will reasonably preclude specimen contamination or adulteration. 
                  (4)  Each initial and confirmation test conducted not including the taking or collecting of a specimen to be tested, shall be conducted by a laboratory as described in subsection (13) below.

                  c.  A qualified person certified or employed by a collection company. 
                  (6)  Within five working days after receipt of a positive confirmed test result from the laboratory, an employer shall inform an employee or job applicant in writing of such positive test results, the consequences of such results, and the options available to the employee or job applicant. 
                  (7)  The employer shall provide to the employee or job applicant, upon request, a copy of the test results. 
                  (8)  An initial test having a positive result must be verified by a confirmation test. 
                  (9)  An employer who performs drug testing or specimen collection shall use chain of custody procedures to ensure proper record keeping, handling, labeling, and identification of all specimens to be tested. 
                  (10)  An employer shall pay the cost of all drug tests, initial and confirmation, which the employer requires of employees. 
                  (11)  An employee or job applicant shall pay the cost of any additional tests not required by the employer. 
                  (12)  If testing is conducted based on reasonable suspicion, the employer shall promptly detail in writing the circumstances which formed the basis of the determination that reasonable suspicion existed to warrant the testing. A copy of this documentation shall be given to the employee upon request and the original documentation shall be kept confidential to the employer and retained by the employer. 
                  (13)  No laboratory may analyze initial or confirmation drug or alcohol specimens unless: 
                  a.  The laboratory is approved by the National Institute on Drug Abuse or the College of American Pathologists; 
                  b.  The laboratory has written procedures to ensure the chain of custody; and 
                  c.  The laboratory follows proper quality control procedures including, but not limited to: 
                  1.  The use of internal quality controls including the use of samples of known concentrations which are used to check the performance and calibration of testing equipment, and periodic use of blind samples for overall accuracy; 
                  2.  An internal review and certification process for drug test results, conducted by a person qualified to perform that function in the testing laboratory; 
                  3.  Security measures implemented by the testing laboratory to preclude adulteration of specimens and drug test results; and 
                  4.  Other necessary and proper actions taken to ensure reliable and accurate drug test results. 
                  (14)  A laboratory shall disclose to the employer a written test result report within seven working days after receipt of the sample. All laboratory reports of a substance abuse test result shall, at a minimum, state: 
                  a.  The name and address of the laboratory which performed the test and the positive identification of the person tested; 
                  b.  Positive results on confirmation tests only, or negative results, as applicable; 
                  c.  A list of the drugs for which the drug analyses were conducted; and

Also, included for testing is alcohol and ethanol. An employer may test an individual for any or all of these. 
                  (15)  Laboratories shall provide technical assistance to the employer, employee, or job applicant for the purpose of interpreting any positive confirmed test results which could have been caused by prescription or nonprescription medication taken by the employee or job applicant. 
                  (16)  If an initial drug test is negative, the employer may in its sole discretion seek a confirmation test. Only laboratories as described in subsection (13) hereof shall conduct confirmation drug tests. 
                  (17)  All positive initial tests shall be confirmed using the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MC) method or an equivalent or more accurate scientifically accepted methods approved by the National Institute on Drug Abuse as such technology becomes available in a cost-effective form. 
                  (18)  Any employee who questions the results of a required drug test under this policy may request that the split sample be tested. This test must be conducted at a different DHHS-certified laboratory. The test must be conducted on the split sample that was provided by the employee at the same time as the original sample. All costs for such testing are paid by the employee unless the result of the split sample test invalidates the result of the original test. The method of collecting, storing, and testing the split sample will be consistent with the procedures set forth in 49 Code of Federal Regulations Part 40 as amended. The employee's request for a split sample test must be made to the medical review officer within 72 hours of notice of the original sample verified test result. Requests after 72 hours will only be accepted if the delay was due to documentable facts that were beyond the control of the employee; 
                  (19)  Tests for breach alcohol concentration will be conducted utilizing a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration approved testing device operated by a trained technician. If the initial test indicates an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, a second test will be performed to confirm the results of the initial test. Any employee who has confirmed alcohol concentration of greater than 0.02 but less than 0.04 will be removed from his/her position for eight hours unless a retest results in a concentration measure of less than 0.02. An alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater will be considered a positive alcohol test and in violation of the county policy.

                  Sec. 12-36. - Refusal to be tested. 
                  Any employee of Whitfield County who, upon reasonable suspicion of management to be under the influence of illegal drugs or alcohol, will be required to submit to a drug screen test; in the event any employee refuses to submit to the drug screen test, that employee will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination; in the event any job applicant refuses to submit to the drug screen test, that applicant will not be eligible for hire by the county. 
                  (Mo. of 7-12-94) 
                  Sec. 12-37. - Confidentiality. 
                  No physician-patient relationship is created between the employee or applicant and Whitfield County, or any other person performing or evaluating a substance abuse test solely by the establishment, implementation or administration of substance abuse testing. The confidentiality of any information received by the employer through a substance abuse testing program shall be maintained, except as otherwise provided by law. The county shall release information regarding a covered employee's record as directed by specific, written consent from the employee authorizing release of information to an identified person. A covered employee is entitled, upon written request, to obtain copies of any records pertaining to his/her use of prohibited substances, including any records pertaining to test results. 
                  Whitfield County may disclose information that is required to be maintained to the decision maker in a lawsuit, grievance, or other proceeding initiated by or on behalf of the employee tested. When requested by the National Transportation Safety Board as part of an accident investigation, the county shall disclose information related to its administration of drug and alcohol tests following the accident investigation. Records shall be made available to subsequent employers upon receipt of written request from the covered employee. Whitfield County shall disclose data for its drug and alcohol testing program and any other information pertaining to its anti-drug program, when requested by the secretary of transportation or any DOT agency with regulatory authority over Whitfield County.

                  Sec. 12-38. - Treatment. 
                  (a)  Treatment programs. Participation in a treatment program will not affect the employee's career advancement or employment, nor will it protect any employee from disciplinary action if substandard job performance continues. A treatment program is a process used in conjunction with discipline, not as a substitute for discipline. 
                  (b)  Counseling. It is the responsibility of the county's supervisors to counsel employees whenever they see changes in performance or behavior that suggest an employee has a drug or alcohol problem. Although it is not the supervisor's job to diagnose personal problems, the supervisor should encourage such employees to seek help and advise them about the available resources for getting help. Everyone shares responsibility for maintaining a safe work environment, and co-workers should encourage anyone who has a drug or alcohol problem to seek help.

                  Sec. 12-39. - Intent of policy. 
                  The goal of this policy is to balance our respect for individuals with the need to maintain a safe, productive and drug and alcohol free environment. The intent of this policy is to offer a helping hand to those who need it, while sending a clear message that the illegal use of drugs and the abuse of alcohol are incompatible with employment at Whitfield County.

                  Sec. 12-40. - Supplemental regulations for safety-sensitive employees. 
                  A Whitfield County safety sensitive employee is any employee who holds a commercial driver's license, operators of any equipment, employees performing the job of mechanic, traffic flow technicians and all supervisors of the above. It is a violation of the county policy for safety-sensitive employees to: 
                  (1)  Consume alcohol on the job. 
                  (2)  Consume alcohol for four hours prior to reporting for duty. 
                  (3)  Consume alcohol for eight hours after an accident or until they have been tested. 
                  (4)  Consume alcohol when they are on call. 
                  Alcohol tests will only be conducted just before, during, or just after the performance of safety-sensitive job functions. Drug tests will be conducted any time the safety-sensitive employee is on duty. A safety-sensitive employee who has a breath alcohol concentration level of 0.04 or greater is in violation of the regulations. The employee must be immediately removed from his or her safety-sensitive duties and referred to a substance abuse professional. 
                  It shall be a condition of employment for safety-sensitive employees to submit to drug and alcohol testing under any circumstance. Safety-sensitive employees are subject to random testing which must be unannounced and spread throughout the year. Whitfield County policy does not require a second supervisor to make a reasonable suspicion referral for safety-sensitive employees and under no circumstances should an impaired employee be sent home without first being tested. 
                  Any safety-sensitive employee who is suspected of providing false information in connection with a test, or who is suspected of falsifying test results through tampering, contamination, adulteration, or substitution will be required to undergo an observed collection. 
                  These regulations are in addition to and do not otherwise alter the substance abuse policy statement.

                  ARTICLE IV. - HARASSMENT POLICY 

                  Sec. 12-51. - Policy. 
                  Whitfield County is committed to maintaining a work environment that is free of discrimination and harassment. In keeping with this commitment, we will not tolerate harassment of employees by anyone, including any supervisor, co-worker, vendor, client or customer of Whitfield County.

                  Sec. 12-52. - Definition. 
                  Harassment consists of unwelcome conduct, whether verbal, physical, or visual, that is based upon a person's protected status, such as sex, color, race, religion, national origin, age, disability or other protected group status as provided for by law. Whitfield County will not tolerate harassing conduct that affects tangible job benefits, that interferes unreasonably with an individual's work performance, or that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. 
                  (Mo. of 7-12-94, § 2) 
                  Sec. 12-53. - Sexual harassment. 
                  Generally, sexual harassment occurs if an employer or department head makes the granting of sexual favors a condition of continued employment or promotion in Whitfield County, or if a hostile or embarrassing atmosphere is created in the workplace as a result of lewd remarks and obscene language. Allowing employees to make unwelcome advances to co-workers also falls under the definition of sexual harassment. 
                  Additionally, unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other physical, verbal, or visual conduct based on sex constitute sexual harassment when (1) submission to the conduct is an explicit or implicit term or condition of employment; (2) submission to or rejection of the conduct issued as the basis for an employment decision; or (3) the conduct has the purpose or effect of reasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. Sexual harassment may include explicit sexual propositions, sexual innuendo, suggestive comments, sexual oriented "kidding," or "teasing," "practical jokes," jokes about gender-specific traits, foul or obscene language or gestures, displays of foul or obscene printed or visual material, and physical contact, such as patting, pinching, or brushing against another's body.

                  Sec. 12-54. - Harassment not tolerated. 
                  Whitfield County will not tolerate any harassment of any nature and any charge of harassment shall be promptly and confidentially investigated. 
                  (Mo. of 7-12-94, § 4) 
                  Sec. 12-55. - Complaint procedure. 
                  (a)  All employees are responsible for helping to assure that we avoid harassment. If you feel that you have experienced or witnessed harassment, either general or sexual, you are to notify immediately (preferably within 24 hours) your immediate supervisor or department head, or the personnel department, or other Whitfield County officials. If any of the above named is the harasser, then obviously, you would bypass that person and go to higher county officials. You will be asked to put your complaint in writing and the county forbids any retaliation against anyone who reports harassment. 
                  (b)  If the allegations warrant, the county's policy is to investigate all such complaints in a prompt and confidential manner. To the fullest extent practicable, the county will keep complaints and the terms of their resolution confidential. If an investigation confirms that harassment has occurred, the county will take corrective action, including such discipline up to and including termination of employment, as is appropriate. 
                  (c)  Whitfield County recognizes that false accusations of sexual harassment can have a serious effect on innocent men and women. Individuals falsely accusing another of sexual harassment will be disciplined in accordance with the nature and extent of his or her false accusation. The county encourages any employee to raise questions he or she may have regarding sexual harassment or this policy, with his or her immediate supervisor, a higher level department head, personnel department, or other county officials. 
                  (d)  All harassment is strictly forbidden by the county and shall not be condoned or sanctioned in any way. Whitfield County shall deal forcefully, quickly and thoroughly with any violator as circumstances dictate and in keeping with due process of law.

                  (a)  Guidelines. Decisions as to which travel is authorized begins with the budgetary process. Travel needs must be anticipated and submitted in the budget each year for approval by the board of commissioners. The authorizing party's responsibility is to stay within departmental budget travel appropriations as approved by the board of commissioners. Prior to approving a travel request, the authorizing party is responsible for determining that a sufficient unexpended or unencumbered appropriation remains in the travel budget to reimburse all expected costs of the travel. Requests for travel, travel advances, and actual expense reimbursement should be authorized as follows: 

                   
                  (b)  Expense reimbursement policies. The following reimbursement guidelines are intended to set forth maximum standards. Employees and officials of the county are expected to spend funds conservatively and to the best interest of county operations. Personal items are not authorized. (If the county does not pay for it while at work, it will not be reimbursed for while traveling.) The expense of family members is not authorized except in those instances where the employee's spouse is a registered participant in the conference, meeting, etc., or the attendance of the spouse is authorized, in advance, by the authorizing party. Expense reports must be prepared to reflect only actual expenses essential to the conduct of the county business. 
                  (1)  Subsistence. 
                  a.  Lodging. Reimbursement for lodging is authorized when the individual's travel requires overnight accommodations. Overnight accommodations must be authorized. Receipts are required for all lodging costs. 
                  1.  Lodging shall be in a standard hotel/motel consistent with other facilities available in the travel vicinity. Room rates should be obtained at "government rates" if possible. 
                  2.  Advance registration, prepaid by county check, shall be used unless documentation from the vendor expressly stating they accept no checks whatsoever. 
                  3.  Employees are responsible for obtaining a tax-exempt certificate from the finance department prior to travel. This certificate is to be presented to the hotel/motel at the time of check-in. Employees and officials shall not be reimbursed for taxes eligible for exemption by this certificate except for inmate transport or emergency situations. 
                  4.  Should a check not be available as outlined in 2., above, then accommodations shall be reimbursed at actual costs incurred at the single room rate unless the room is shared by two employees. When two employees share a room, one employee shall pay and request reimbursement for the full lodging charge. The second employee shall not be entitled to any reimbursement. Costs will be properly allocated through the travel expense report in the finance department. 
                  b.  Meals. Employees are entitled to a standard per diem rate for meals and incidentals in the amount of $40.00 (when travel requires overnight stay) not payable in advance but reimbursed with the documentation supporting the attendance of the conference or event for the dates claimed. Employees are entitled to a standard per diem rate for meals and incidentals in the amount of $20.00 (when overnight stay is not required) not payable in advance but reimbursed with the documentation supporting the attendance of the conference or event for the dates claimed. Incidentals include the following: Parking, tips and telephone calls. 
                  c.  Business meals. Management is required to meet with persons of other governments and professional associations in which the exchange of information will prove to be beneficial to the county. When, in the opinion of the administration, such an exchange has occurred, it may be deemed appropriate to pay for the cost of the meal as a guest of the county. Reimbursements for these meals are pursuant to the following stipulations: 
                  1.  The requesting party is a department head, the county administrator, or an elected official. 
                  2.  A receipt is provided. 
                  3.  It is submitted on a travel expense report. 
                  d.  Inmate transport. When travel is required for inmate transport, a county credit card may be signed out through the finance department to use for this purpose (if available). If a credit card is used, or if officers bear the cost up front, all meal tickets and lodging receipts are required and shall be submitted on a travel reimbursement form with proper approval. Expenditures not supported with proper documentation shall be the responsibility of the officer. The credit card, along with all supporting documentation shall be returned to the finance department immediately upon return. 
                  (2)  Travel. The mode of transportation that incurs the least cost to the county and otherwise conforms to the provisions of this policy, shall be authorized. 
                  a.  Air, rail, and bus fare. Air, rail, and bus fare forms of travel will be provided for destinations not within reasonable driving distance. Transportation shall be obtained at the most economical rate available. "Economy" or "tourist" level shall be the standard mode of travel where such services are available. Receipts are required for reimbursements of these transportation costs. 
                  b.  County vehicles. The use of a county vehicle is authorized for business purposes in accordance with the Whitfield County Vehicle Usage Policy. Operation of the county vehicle outside the State of Georgia requires the prior approval of the authorizing authority. 
                  1.  Ride-sharing will be requested when more than one employee attends the same conference, meeting, training, etc. 
                  2.  Gas cards assigned to county vehicles should be used for all gas purchases. No other purchase is allowed with the gas card. Drivers will be assigned a user ID number by the finance department for pooled vehicles. Receipts must be obtained and submitted for all county vehicle expenses excluding gas card purchases. 
                  3.  County vehicles are to be driven only by county employees and officials. 
                  c.  Personal vehicles. Use of personal vehicles is allowed for employees with authorized auto allowance or when no county vehicle is available. 
                  1.  The reimbursement rate for personal vehicle mileage is $0.375 per mile. 
                  2.  When more than one employee is attending a particular function, separate car allowances will not be approved unless separate arrival and departure times are dictated by other county business or the number of attendees is greater than four. 
                  3.  The authorizing party is responsible for assuring that the total number of miles requested is appropriate as compared to published standard mileage charts. 
                  d.  Rental cars. A rental car may be used when it is determined that no other mode of transportation is economical or practical (i.e. taxi, mass transit, etc.). 
                  1.  Rentals shall be limited to "mid-size" cars with standard accessories, unless special circumstances dictate a larger vehicle. 
                  2.  Rentals should be covered by appropriate insurance, as required by applicable state laws. 
                  3.  All county policies/procedures governing the use of vehicles shall apply to rental vehicles. 
                  4.  Receipts are required for the reimbursements of any rental cars costs, including gasoline. 
                  (3)  Registration. Registration, tuition, or conference fees, when representing the county on official business, are reimbursable when supported by a receipt. Advance registration, prepaid by county check, should be used as stated in (1)a.2., above.

                  (a)  Travel advances. Travel advances for subsistence, travel, registration and incidentals shall not be granted for authorized travel. The use of advance checks for registration and hotels as well as the provision of per diem reimbursement as stated herein alleviate the need for the use of travel advances. 
                  (b)  Reimbursements. Upon returning from any properly authorized trip, the employee shall present to their authorizing party a complete itemization of all trip expenses on a travel expense report. This final expense statement, with all required receipts, shall be submitted to the authorizing party within 30 days after returning from the authorized trip. The authorizing party shall review, sign, and promptly submit the itemization of expenses to the finance department.

                  (a)  Any utility using or occupying any part of a county road which the department has undertaken to improve or intends to improve shall remove and relocate its facility when, in the reasonable opinion of the department, the facility constitutes an obstruction or interference with the use or safe operation of such road by the travelling public or when, in the reasonable opinion of the department, the facility will interfere with such contemplated construction or maintenance. 
                  (b)  Whenever the department reasonably determines it necessary to have a utility facility removed and relocated, the department shall give to the utility at least 60 days' written notice directing the removal and relocation of such utility obstruction. If the utility does not thereafter begin removal within a reasonable time sufficient to allow for engineering and other procedures reasonably necessary to the removal and relocation of the utility facility, the department may give the utility a final notice directing that such removal shall commence not later than ten days from the receipt of such final notice. If such utility does not, within ten days from receipt of such final notice, begin to remove or relocate the facility or, having so begun removal or relocation, thereafter fails to complete the removal or relocation within a reasonable time, the department may remove or relocate the same with its own employees or by employing or contracting for the necessary engineering, labor, tools, equipment, supervision, or other necessary services or materials and whatever else is necessary to accomplish the removal or relocation. 
                  (c)  The expenses incurred by the department as a result of utility removal and relocation pursuant to subsection (b), above, shall be paid by the utility. A statement of such expenses shall be submitted to the utility, which shall make payment to Whitfield County, Georgia. In the event the utility does not make payment or arrange to make payment to the county, within 60 days after the receipt of said statement, the department shall certify the amount for collection to the county attorney. 
                  Sec. 13-22. - Permit requirements and procedures. 
                  (1)  Purpose. The purpose of the permit process is to regulate and control modification of and access to the county highway system. Regulations are necessary in order to preserve the functional integrity of the county highway system and to promote the safe and efficient movement of people and goods within the county. The development of a management program serves to protect the traveling public through an orderly control of traffic entering and leaving the county highway system, to prevent hazardous parking adjacent to the travel way, to insure uniform design and construction of driveways on the county highway system, to make certain that modification of the county right-of-way [does not create unsafe conditions for the traveling public, to prevent unauthorized use of county right-of-way] and to allow beautification of property fronting on the county highway system. The permit process applies to all roads under the jurisdiction of Whitfield County. 
                  (2)  Permit required. Any third party desiring to physically modify any portion of a county road shall first file with the office of the county road superintendent an application in writing in such form as the county road superintendent may prescribe, and obtain a formal permit for such modification. 
                  (3)  Application and approval procedure. 
                  (a)  Application forms. Applications for the various permits must be made on the proper form. These forms may be obtained from the department. Only original forms may be used when making application for one of these permits. Each copy of the application must be signed in ink by the applicant. Application forms will not be furnished for future needs; rather, they will be provided for each permit request after the geometric design and location of the requested driveway and/or other encroachments are agreed upon. 
                  (b)  Applicant qualifications. Application for a permit under these rules will be accepted only from the property owner, leasor or an official representing the company, organization or group which owns or leases the property abutting the R/W and upon which the driveway or other permit work will be constructed. In the event the applicant leases the property, the lease should be for a period of at least three years, or the permit must be issued to the property owner. In any case, written acknowledgement of the permit work must be obtained from the owner or his agent. 
                  (c)  Where to file application. Applications must be filed with the Whitfield County Road Department. 
                  (d)  Plan requirements. A plan must accompany the application which complies with the department's commercial driveway specifications or other encroachments. In addition, the department require in appropriate circumstances to be determined by the department whether a plan should accompany any other application. Data relative to the requested permit must be furnished by the applicant without cost to the department. The permit engineer is available for consultation and advice in these matters to help the applicant develop a plan and design to serve his development while working within the rules and regulations of the department. 
                  (e)  Provisions of a permit. The provisions of any permit granted shall be construed as regulatory and not as contractual. No interest or right of an applicant shall be transferred to another except by written consent of the department. No inherent or related right or privilege belonging to any abutting property owner is affected, interfered with or abridged by these standards or by any permit issued thereunder, nor is the county responsible for any damage claim which may arise as between the applicant and any adjacent property owner. 
                  (f)  Cost. The department does not charge for these permits at this time. However, the applicant must furnish copies of the approved plans and is responsible for all engineering and construction costs, unless the provisions of the resolution of the Board of Commissioners of Whitfield County dated January 25, 1994 amended July 26, 1994 pertaining to certain installations of drainage pipe and drain tile apply. Job review and inspection and limited engineering service may be rendered by the department during the time the work is being accomplished. When the complexity of the work requires continuous inspection, as determined by the county road superintendent. This determination and an estimate of inspection costs will be made part of the approved permit. 
                  (g)  Department approval. The processing of permits will be accomplished by department personnel in an expeditious manner. The district permit engineer will see that all requests for permits are acted on in a timely fashion. 
                  (4)  Conditions placed on permits. The conditions enumerated in this subsection are agreed to by the applicant for a driveway or encroachment permit and are part of the terms of such permit. These conditions to the permit continue in effect unless changes are made or authorized by the department. 
                  (a)  General restrictions. 
                  1.  Parking is prohibited on county roads except in those instances where temporary conditional special encroachment permit is approved for parking on the R/W. 
                  2.  Driveways shall not be provided within the R/W for purposes of parking, loading, servicing, etc. 
                  3.  Geometric and safety requirements must be maintained as stipulated in the permit and shall not be altered by the applicant. 
                  4.  An approved permit must be picked up by the applicant within 60 days of approval. If not, the permit must be canceled. 
                  5.  Work under the permit must begin within 90 days after approval. Failure to begin work will be cause for the permit to be canceled. 
                  6.  Construction work authorized by an approved permit should be completed within 12 months following approval of the permit. Permitted work not completed within 12 months, for just reasons, may be officially extended for additional six-month increments. 
                  7.  New driveways to new businesses should not be opened for use by the traveling public until the final inspection. 
                  (b)  Liability and responsibility of applicant. 
                  1.  Applicants to whom permits have been approved shall at all times indemnify and save harmless the department and county from responsibility for any damages or liability arising from the maintenance, repair, operation or use of any installation, parts of installation, construction procedures or actual construction approved under the permit. When determined necessary by the department, the applicant must exhibit satisfactory evidence of adequate liability insurance to cover all phases of work specified under the permit for the protection of the traveling public. Limits of such coverage shall be determined separately for each applicant and declared by the department at its discretion. 
                  2.  The applicant must move, relocate or remove any installation or construction placed on DOT R/W without cost to Whitfield County when instructed in writing to do so by the department. 
                  (c)  Permit change or modification. No driveway approach or other improvement constructed on a county road as an exercise of the permit shall be relocated or its dimensions altered without the written permission of the department. 
                  (d)  Property interest. No property interest is created by the granting of a permit even if the applicant, or his transferee or a subsequent transferee, has incurred expenses or expended effort in reliance on such permit. 
                  (5)  Violation of conditions in permit. A violation of conditions specified in a permit shall be grounds for revocation of the permit, removing, correcting, barricading, displacing or closing such driveway and restoring the R/W. 
                  Sec. 13-23. - Other driveways. 
                  (1)  Utility driveways. Access to utility sites such as power substations, water tanks, or telephone service sites are to be permitted and should be treated much the same as a residential drive for design and sight distance. The vehicle must not reduce sight distance for driveways located along the same section of roadway. A utility driveway may or may not count as one allowed access point along an applicant's frontage, depending on the length of frontage and safety considerations. 
                  (2)  Farm use, logging and mining driveways. These driveways are to be permitted by the department in a manner similar to a utility driveway. A logging driveway will usually be a temporary drive which will either be removed when the logging operation is completed or left in to become a farm use driveway. A mining operation may require a more substantial design to function properly. 
                  Sec. 13-24. - Commercial driveway specifications. 
                  (1)  Purpose. The specifications presented herein are intended to provide basic information for permit approval. When presented with this information, the department can review the application in a timely manner and fulfill its responsibility to preserve the functional integrity of the county highway system and to promote the safe and efficient movement of people and goods throughout the county and to treat all applicants fairly and equitably. 
                  (2)  Plan requirements. Five blue line or black line copies of the plans, "A1" metric series - 594 × 841 mm (22 inches × 34 inches) maximum, will normally be submitted with a properly completed permit application. 
                  (a)  Design information. The following information should be included on, or with, each plan submission: 
                  1.  An overall site plan and location sketch map. 
                  2.  All existing features should be shown with dashed lines and all proposed features shown with solid lines. This should be clearly shown on the plan legend. 
                  3.  Location of all property lines and the names of the property owner on either side of the property being developed. 
                  4.  The distance from the centerline of the highway or road to the R/W line. (A general statement such as "Right-of-Way Varies" is not acceptable.) 
                  5.  Existing and proposed elevations sufficient to show the natural and proposed drainage features within the property to be developed. This should include all of the adjacent highway R/W and any elevations needed to show how water flows once it leaves this property. 
                  6.  A north arrow. 
                  7.  All existing traffic signs within the frontage being developed. 
                  8.  The width of existing roadway pavements, lane widths, lane lines and direction of travel (using directional arrows) within the lanes. 
                  9.  The total length of frontage of the property owned and, if different, the length of the frontage being developed under the permit. 
                  10.  Location, size and type of any trees, shrubs, bushes or other vegetation which exist on county R/W. 
                  11.  The distance from the edge of pavement to the side ditch and the direction of the flow of water within the ditch. 
                  12.  The location and size of any existing and proposed side drain or cross drain culverts. 
                  13.  Location of existing and proposed buildings, pumps, signs, grease racks, wash racks, underground storage tanks, etc. 
                  14.  The proposed driveway width, measured either from face of curb to face of barb or from edge of pavement to edge of pavement. This measurement shall be perpendicular to the centerline of the driveway at its narrowest point. 
                  15.  The distance from the centerline of the driveway to each property line, measured along the R/W line. 
                  16.  Driveways and any new shoulder work on a tangent section should slope downward and away from the edge of pavement for a distance of at least 3.6m (12 feet) at a slope rate of 2.08% (one-quarter) inch per foot), generally, including any accel/decel lane. If located in a super elevated section, all construction should match the superelevation for at least 3.6m (12 feet). 
                  17.  Sight distance at each driveway. 
                  18.  The difference in elevation between the roadway and the driveway at the R/W line. The slope should not be greater than +/- 6.25%, if practical. There are situations which require greater slopes; these should be examined carefully before approving their use. In no case should the slope exceed ten percent. 
                  19.  Georgia DOT Standard 9031-W (wheelchair ramps) must be included at all driveways and streets where sidewalk is installed or there is evidence of pedestrian traffic. 
                  (b)  Driveway encroachment. 
                  1.  Connecting curve or curb return. No portion of a driveway, including the radius, should intersect a curb return or the pavement on a curve connecting two highways or streets. 
                  2.  R/W line projection. No portion of a driveway should be within the area between the normal R/W lines projected to the curbline or edge of pavement at an intersection. The department may waive this provision when a deep R/W or an acute angle formed by the intersection makes such action appropriate. 
                  3.  R/W miter. No part of any driveway should be permitted to encroach upon the R/W miter. The R/W miter is that additional R/W which has been secured for the highway behind the prolongation of the normal R/W lines in order to provide for channelization of traffic or more adequate sight distance. 
                  4.  Intersection features. 
                  a.  The legs, connections, ramps, and other roadway features of a highway intersection or interchange are a part of the intersection or interchange. The safety of the public and the planned movement of traffic require that no driveway be connected with such features for the purpose of serving a commercial business. 
                  b.  A driveway serving a roadside area should not be connected to a service or frontage road of a limited access road in the area where said service road serves the dual purpose of a leg, connector or ramp of an intersection or interchange. 
                  c.  No driveway should be connected to a frontage road or service road in the area where the service road is widened or curved for the connection with an interchange or intersection connection, ramp or leg. 
                  d.  No portion of a driveway, other than a normal radius, should enter the R/W at a point which is less than 7.6m (25 feet) from the point of intersection of the R/W lines. Where limited access R/W exists and the frontage is limited in a manner which would deny all access to the property, this distance may be reduced to 3m (ten feet). 
                  Sec. 13-25. - When a driveway may be closed or altered. 
                  In addition to the conditions agreed to by the applicant, the department may alter or close driveway(s) or require the applicant to alter or close driveway(s) to property abutting county roads for the following reasons: 
                  (a)  If the driveway(s) creates an unreasonable interference with the proper use of a public road by the traveling public. 
                  (b)  When it becomes necessary to use the R/W to widen and improve the existing roadway or to construct service roads or to make any other revisions in location, alignment or grade of the roadway, making the approved drive(s) impractical, hazardous or otherwise objectionable. 
                  Sec. 13-26. - Other encroachments, permit required. 
                  Any third party desiring to encroach upon a county right-of-way for any reason other than to use said right-of-way for its intended purposes must file an encroachment permit application including a site plan, and, if requested by the department, a landscaping plan and a cross-section plan, each of which conforms to the department's standards and specifications. 
                  (a)  Site plan. The following information should be included on or with each application for a special encroachment permit: 
                  1.  An overall site plan and location sketch map. 
                  2.  All existing features should be shown with dashed lines and all proposed features shown with solid lines. This should be clearly shown on the plan legend. 
                  3.  Location of all property lines and the names of the property owner on either side of the property being developed. 
                  4.  The distance from the centerline of the highway or road to the R/W line. (A general statement such as "Right-of-Way Varies" is not acceptable.) 
                  5.  County route numbers, state route numbers and U.S. route numbers (if applicable) and names of all highways and roads which appear on the plans. Designations such as "County Road," "Cross Road," or "City Street" are not specific enough and should not be used.

                  9.  The DOT milepost, if available, estimated to the nearest hundredth of a mile, at the center of the property being developed. When using milepost along an interstate route, use the cumulative milepost instead of the county milepost. 
                  10.  The posted speed limit. 
                  11.  All existing and proposed DOT signs within the frontage being developed. 
                  12.  The width of existing roadway pavements, lane widths, lane lines and direction of travel (using directional arrows) within the lanes. 
                  13.  The total length of frontage of the property owned and, if different, the length of the frontage being developed under the permit. 
                  14.  Location, size and type of any trees, shrubs, bushes or other vegetation which exist on county R/W. 
                  15.  A title block showing the name of the property owner and the permit applicant, if different from the property owner, and the county in which the project is located. The name of the engineer or individual who prepared the plans should be included also. 
                  16.  Existing and proposed ditches on the applicant's property. 
                  17.  Location, size, length, type of material and direction of flow within any existing or proposed pipes or culverts on the site. 
                  18.  Station numbers along the edge of pavement to match cross-section locations. Use highway stationing if possible. 
                  (b)  Cross-section plan. 
                  1.  Cross-sections, if requested by the department, taken at right angles to the centerline of the highway at 15m (50-foot) intervals, or less depending on the consistency of the terrain along the property frontage, with at least one cross-section showing the existing ground line beyond the proposed grading limits at either end. 
                  2.  Cross-sections should start at the pavement edge and extend at least 15m (50 feet) behind the R/W line. 
                  3.  Cross-sections should always be plotted on a 1:12 (1″ = 1′) ratio. 
                  4.  Existing and proposed finished contours should be shown in order to clarify proposed work. 
                  5.  Slopes with a county R/W should be 4:1 or flatter. 
                  6.  Quantities of cut and fill within county R/W should be calculated and shown on the plan apart from overall earthwork quantities. 
                  7.  A dashed line should be used to indicate existing ground line and a solid line to indicate the proposed finished ground line. 
                  8.  Spot elevations should be shown at sufficient intervals to depict existing ground conditions. 
                  9.  Requests involving limited access highways may require suitable photographs of the site showing all existing features. 
                  10.  In "cut" sections, a high point rollover should be established or maintained between the ditch or curb and the R/W line. This rollover should be at least 0.3m (one foot) above a line from the edge of pavement to the finished grade of the applicant's site. If headlight glare is a likely problem, enough landscaping to screen the glare or a 1.2m (four-foot) high rollover may be required. 
                  (c)  Landscaping plan.

                  5.  The distance from the centerline of the highway or road to the R/W line. (A general statement such as "Rights-of-Way Varies" is not acceptable.) 
                  6.  County route numbers, state route numbers and U.S. route numbers (if applicable) and names of all highways and road which appear on the plans. Designations such as "County Road," "Cross Road," or "City Street" are not specific enough and should not be used. 
                  7.  Existing and proposed contour lines or elevations sufficient to show the natural and proposed drainage features within the property to be developed. This should include all of the adjacent highway R/W and any elevations needed to show how the water flows once it leaves this property. Flow arrows should also be used along with contour lines and elevations. 
                  8.  Distance from one corner of the property, along the R/W of the abutting road, to the centerline of the nearest named street, road or highway. 
                  9.  A north arrow.

Some flexibility may be exercised relative to maximum trunk diameter when protected by guardrail or some other suitable type barrier. Almost any type of vegetation may be planted beyond 9m (30 feet) from the pavement edge. AASHTO design guidelines for clear zone must be observed as a minimum separation between plants over 100mm (four inches) in diameter and the edge of the through-traffic lane. 
                  Sec. 13-27. - Prohibited encroachments. 
                  [The following encroachments are prohibited:] 
                  (1)  County R/W must not be used for parking or storage of any vehicle, except for temporary parking of disabled vehicles on the shoulder of roads. 
                  (2)  No materials can be stored or placed upon county R/W unless authorized by the department. 
                  (3)  Stormwater from property adjacent to the R/W may not be diverted into the highway drainage system. Commercial wastewater will not be allowed on county R/W. 
                  (4)  No walls, fences, signs, large rocks, monuments, structures, trees or other plant life can be placed on or removed from county R/W without a special encroachment permit.

                  Sec. 14-58. - Intersection design. 
                  Intersection design shall be in compliance with the specifications contained in Table 14.3.6 and as follows. These standards shall govern for all residential-residential, residential-collector, and collector-collector intersections. 
                  (1)  Intersections shall be designed with flat grade wherever practical. In rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a leveling area shall be provided. 
                  (2)  Centerline grades are to meet at the crown of each roadway unless the proposed road is a local road connecting to a collector or arterial road. In such case the proposed road centerline shall match the edge of pavement. 
                  (3)  Intersection design shall be in compliance with the specifications contained in Table 14.3.6. These standards shall govern for all residential-residential, residential-collector, and collector-collector intersections. 
                  (4)  The intersection of two roads shall be designed to provide proper sight distance. Minimum sight distances as shown in Table 14.3.6 are required at all intersections. 
                  (5)  Where any intersection is created which would create a traffic hazard by limiting visibility within the clear sight distance, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent deemed necessary to comply with the sight distance requirements of this ordinance and shall not erect any sign or improvement which would preclude safe sight distance. 
                  (6)  It shall be required that all intersection approaches meet at approximately a 90 degree angle. Mitigating circumstances may require the intersection approach to meet at an angle less 90 degrees; however, such approved angle shall not be less than 75 degrees. Any oblique road shall be curved approaching an intersection and shall be approximately at right angles for at least 50 feet therefrom. Not more than two roads shall intersect at any specific point. 
                  (7)  Offsets of at least 150 feet between centerlines shall be required between local roads. In the case of two collector road intersections, this offset shall be increased to at least 200 feet in order to allow for left-turn storage between intersections. 
                  (8)  When offset intersections are used at an arterial; they should be located to avoid conflicting left turns. Such left-turn conflicts exist when an intersection offsets to the right rather than to the left. 
                  (9)  For a local road intersecting a local road, any proposed new intersections along one side of an existing road shall coincide, wherever practicable, with any existing intersections on the opposite side of such road. 
                  (10)  It is desirable to provide a tangent section of roadway approaching intersections, when the road leg has a minimum or near-minimum radius curve. The guideline values in Table 14.3.6 would not apply to a collector with a 1,000-foot radius that is intersected by a residential street. It would apply to an intersecting residential road with a 200-foot radius leg.

                  Sec. 14-65. - Wellhead protection areas. 
                  Every wellhead protection area consists of two zones, as follows: 
                  (1)  The control zone shall be a circle outward from the well bore, with a radius of 15 feet for impervious surface material, such as concrete, or a radius of 25 feet for permeable surface material. Within the control zone, activities shall be restricted so that there are minimal sources of potential pollution in the immediate vicinity of the well bore. Only chemicals used for water treatment may be stored in this zone. Motor fuels, oil, motor vehicles, or portable equipment powered by an internal combustion engine shall not be stored in the control zone. On-site fuel storage for auxiliary power shall have a spill containment system for the entire volume of fuel.

Wells drawing water only from confined aquifers will have an inner management zone extending outward from the center of the well bore or spring head for a radius of 100 feet. Wells drawing water from unconfined aquifers, except those lying areas of karst, will have an inner management zone extending outward from the center of the well bore or spring head for a radius of 250 feet. Wells drawing water from unconfined aquifers identified as being in areas of karst, will have an inner management zone extending outward from the center of the well bore or spring head for a radius of 500 feet. The outer management zone shall be determined as follows: Wells drawing water only from confined aquifers are not required to have an outer management zone. Wells drawing water from unconfined aquifers identified as being in areas of karst, will have an outer management zone determined by hydrological mapping. Wells drawing water from unconfined aquifers utilizing fractured crystalline rock aquifers will have an outer management zone determined according to the "Health Method Curve" contained in the EPA approved Georgia Wellhead Protection Plan. Other wells not meeting the above criteria will have their outer management zones determined by time of travel calculations (minimum of a five-year time of travel) or by volumetric calculations as appropriate.

                  The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain, and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and non-point source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It is determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure; safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public; and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
                  (1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities which protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
                  (2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in its post-development state as nearly as practicable, in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, non-point source pollution, and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
                  (3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
                  (4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities which can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
                  (5)  Encourage the use of non-structural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable; 
                  (6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater, control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure continued functionality as designed, maintenance, and that they pose no threat to public safety; and, 
                  (7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up.

                  (1)  Exempt subdivision.

                  (2)  Minor subdivision. Any division of a lot or parcel into two or more lots, building sites, parcels, or other divisions (or redivision of the same parcel which alters lot lines) which fronts upon an existing public or private road and which does not require any new or improved road, public water, sewer service, or other utility extensions and which is not otherwise in conflict with any provision of this chapter. 
                  a.  For any lot or parcel located within the General Agriculture (GA) zoning district, there shall be excepted from the three acre minimum lot requirement any subdivision of a lot or parcel for purposes of transfer, either by sale or by gift, to a family member of the original owner thereof: 
                  1.  The original parcel may be subdivided at one time or over a period of time; however, each exception for each proposed divided parcel shall be considered separately.

                  4.  Any misstatement of a material fact or violation of any of the provisions of this subsection by the original owner or a family member shall constitute sufficient grounds for denial by the Whitfield County Building, Zoning and Development Department, either for the pending request or for any future requests concerning the original or previously divided parcels. 
                  5.  A divided parcel as well as any remaining portion of the original parcel must at all times meet applicable minimum lot size standards then in effect pursuant to the provisions of this article.

                  Sec. 15-31. - Purposes. 
                  The purposes of appropriate subdivision and site design is to promote the health, welfare, and safety of the public; to create a functional and aesthetically pleasing development; to minimize adverse impacts; and to ensure that projects will be designed to result in a well-planned community without adding unnecessarily to development costs. 
                  (Ord. of 9-24-01, § 3-1; Res. of 5-13-02) 
                  Sec. 15-32. - General design principles. 
                  (1)  Land suitability. Land which is unsuitable for subdivision or development due to flooding, wetlands, improper drainage, steep slopes, rock formations, adverse earth formations or topography, utility easements, or other features which would be harmful to the safety, health, and general welfare of inhabitants of the land and/or the general public and surrounding areas shall not be subdivided or developed unless adequate methods are designed by the developer/subdivider to solve the problems created by the unstable land conditions. Said design methods shall include but not be limited to Georgia Department of Transportation Standard Manuals and Specifications for the Construction of Roads and Bridges and the Utility Accommodations Policy and Standards, current editions, and supplements thereto; American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Manuals for Arterial Streets, Rural, Urban, and Interstate Highways, current editions; American Water Works Association (AWWA) standards, current editions, Georgia State Department of Natural Resources (DNR), Environmental Protection Division (EPD), Rules for Safe Drinking Water, Rules and Regulations for Water Quality Control, latest editions; American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Standards, latest editions; and American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standards, latest editions. Any such design(s) shall be subject to review and approval by the Whitfield County Engineer. The county engineer shall provide a written statement justifying the denial of the final plat based on land suitability. 
                  (2)  Annexation. Subdivisions planned for future annexation by any city shall be developed to then-current city standards, if any such standard shall exceed that of Whitfield County, and shall be subject to the review and comment of such city. 
                  (Ord. of 9-24-01, § 3-2; Res. of 5-13-02) 
                  Sec. 15-33. - General subdivision design standards. 
                  (1)  Monuments. The developer/subdivider shall place permanent reference monuments in the subdivision as required herein and as approved by a Georgia Registered Land Surveyor. Monuments shall be located and set as follows: 
                  (a)  Monuments shall be located upon road right-of-way lines, at road intersections and at the beginning and ending points of curves. 
                  (b)  All lot corners shall be marked by iron rods, pipe, or pins at least 18 inches long and one-half inch in diameter. 
                  (c)  Lot lines which extend to any state waters shall be monumented in the field by iron pins at least 18 inches long and one-half inch in diameter or by round or square iron bars at least 18 inches long. Such pins shall be placed at the point of intersection of the state waters and lot line, with a meander line established not less than 20 feet back from the bank of the state waters. 
                  (d)  All monuments and pins shall be properly set in the ground and approved by a registered surveyor prior to the submittal of any plat. 
                  (2)  Name of subdivision. The name of the subdivision shall be approved by the Whitfield County Building, Zoning and Development Department and shall neither duplicate nor closely approximate the name of any existing subdivision. Whitfield County may regularly maintain a register of such names, accessible to the public, updated not less than monthly. 
                  (3)  Residential development design. 
                  (a)  The Whitfield County Engineer and/or the planning commission may require additional lot area and/or setbacks provided that lots conform to the minimum requirements of this chapter and the Whitfield County Zoning Ordinance. 
                  (b)  Each lot or parcel shall have sufficient access to it for emergency vehicles as well as for those requiring access to the property for its intended use. 
                  (c)  The design of lots in residential developments shall take into consideration topography, privacy, orientation, drainage, and aesthetics. 
                  (4)  Manufacturing and commercial development design. Manufacturing and commercial development shall be designed according to similar principles governing the design of residential developments. Buildings shall be located according to topography, with environmentally sensitive areas avoided to the maximum extent practicable. Factors such as drainage, noise, odor, surrounding land uses and sufficient access shall be considered. 
                  (5)  Circulation system design. Road systems shall be designed to permit the safe, efficient and orderly movement of traffic; to meet the needs of the present and future population served; to have a simple and logical pattern; to respect natural features and topography; and to present an attractive roadscape. 
                  (6)  Access by private roads. Private roads may [be] approved in subdivision developments where controlled access or privacy is desired by the developer/subdivider provided such roads meet the following conditions: 
                  (a)  The preliminary and final plats of a development proposing private roads shall show a statement indicating: "The road system is private and will not be maintained or improved by Whitfield County." 
                  (b)  The plat review process shall also include evidence of the legal formation of a property owners association to be charged with the minimum responsibility for maintenance of the private road. Such legal documentation shall be recorded and referenced as an attachment to the final plat. 
                  (Ord. of 9-24-01, § 3-3; Res. of 5-13-02; Res. of 1-9-07, § 2; Ord. of 3-19-07) 
                  Sec. 15-34. - Lot design standards. 
                  All lots hereafter established in connection with the development of a subdivision shall comply with the following design standards: 
                  (1)  Lot lines. Insofar as practicable, side lot lines shall be perpendicular to or radial to roadways. 
                  (2)  Jurisdictional limits and lot lines. Lots shall not be divided by preexisting city or county boundary lines. 
                  (3)  Lot access. Each lot or parcel created shall have direct abutting access to an approved public or private road. Each lot must front for at least 50 feet upon an approved road. Construction and/or maintenance of driveways connecting to the public road right-of-way or to the private road shall be the sole responsibility of the lot or parcel owner. 
                  (4)  Building setback lines. Residential building setback lines shall be at least 25 feet from the front property line for lots abutting local roads. With the exception of panhandle or flag lots, the minimum lot width of any lot shall be achieved at a distance into the lot that is not greater than the total frontage distance of the lot. 
                  (5)  Adequate building sites. Each lot shall contain an adequate building site not subject to flooding and outside the limits of any existing easements or building setback lines required by this chapter and any existing ordinance, as is appropriate. 
                  (6)  Panhandle or flag lots. Flag lot designs are generally discouraged and shall only be approved by the planning commission, and such approval is only justified when extreme topographic circumstances, environmental factors, or socio/economic factors make standard design impossible or impractical. Where such lots are allowed, the panhandle access of the lot shall not be less than 50 feet wide for its length, and not more than two such panhandle access points shall abut each other. The following additional criteria apply: 
                  a.  The length of the panhandle access ("the pole") shall generally be no longer than the average depth of the lots adjacent to the panhandle access that are fronting the street; and 
                  b.  In computing the minimum lot size, the geometric area encompassed in the panhandle access shall be excluded. 
                  (7)  Double and/or reverse frontage lots. Double and reverse frontage lots shall be prohibited except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography, orientation, and property size. A planted screen reservation of at least five feet, and across which there shall be no right of access, may be required along the line of lots abutting such traffic arterials or other disadvantageous use. 
                  (8)  Corner lots. Corner lots shall be sufficiently large to permit the location of structures so as to conform to the minimum setback requirement upon both roads. Corner lot lines at road intersections shall have a minimum radii of 20 feet. 
                  (9)  Lot remnants. Lot remnants, except those in excess of three acres created in connection with an exempt subdivision, shall be prohibited. Such remnant areas shall be added to adjacent lots or shall be set aside as green space with permanent conservation easements, rather than to remain as unusable parcels. 
                  (10)  Easements. Easements shall be provided in subdivisions for the following purposes: 
                  a.  Utility easements. When necessary and desirable to locate public utility lines in other than road rights-of-way, easements shall be shown upon the plat for such purposes. Such easements shall be not less than 15 feet in width and, where possible, shall be centered upon rear or side lot lines. 
                  b.  Watercourse and drainage easements. Where a proposed subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, or stream, appropriate provisions shall be made to accommodate stormwater and drainage through and from the proposed subdivision. Such easement shall conform substantially with the lines of said watercourse and be of sufficient width or construction. 
                  c.  Family easement access exemption. There shall be exempted from the access requirement set forth hereinabove at section 15-11 any subdivision of a lot or parcel into not more than five total parcels (which shall include any remaining portion of the original parcel and any other preexisting lots or parcels accessed by such casement) for purposes of transfer, either by sale or by gift, to a family member of the original owner thereof. 
                  1.  The original parcel may be subdivided at one time or over a period of time; however, each exemption for each proposed divided parcel shall be considered separately. 
                  2.  Such exemption shall be requested in writing upon forms provided by the Whitfield County Building, Zoning and Development Department, which shall thereafter request the Whitfield County Fire Chief or his designee to inspect the proposed divided parcel, including the proposed access, and to report back in writing whether such proposed access is or is not adequate for fire protection and other emergency services. 
                  3.  The transfer of any portion of the original parcel or of any divided parcel other than by the laws of testate or intestate succession shall automatically result in the prohibition of any further access exemption for any portion of the original parcel. 
                  4.  The original owner shall provide birth certificates and/or other documentation to the Whitfield County Building, Zoning and Development Department, as reasonably requested, to establish a sufficient family connection for purposes of the exemption. 
                  5.  Any misstatement of a material fact or violation of any of the provisions of this subsection by the original owner or a family member shall constitute sufficient grounds for denial by the Whitfield County Building, Zoning and Development Department, either for the pending request or for any future requests concerning the original or previously divided parcels. 
                  6.  A divided parcel as well as any remaining portion of the original parcel must at all times meet applicable minimum lot size standards then in effect pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. 
                  7.  A divided parcel created pursuant to the terms of this exemption shall include, as an appurtenance thereto, a specifically described nonexclusive easement, 50 feet in width, for purposes of ingress, egress, and above and below ground utility services, allowing access from such divided parcel to a public right-of-way. 
                  8.  The proposed subdivision plat shall contain a statement to read as follows: 
                  FAMILY EXEMPTION PROPERTY 
                  The property shown hereon has been exempted from certain provisions of the Whitfield County Subdivision Ordinance pursuant to subsection 3-10c, of said ordinance. Said property is not located on a public road and, due to such fact, certain county services may not be provided to said property. 
                  9.  No divided parcel or portion thereof shall be eligible for a family easement exemption allowed herein. 
                  10.  Such family easement exemption shall be prohibited in the R-4, R-5, R-6, C-1, C-2, C-2C, M-1, and M-2 zoning districts (as set forth in the Whitfield County Zoning Ordinance). 
                  (11)  Lot depth. Residential lot depth shall not be less than 120 feet or more than four times the lot width at the building line, unless approved by the planning commission after considering topographic circumstances or environmental factors. 
                  (12)—(14) Reserved. 
                  (15)  Minimum lot dimensions and area. The minimum lot area and the minimum lot width at the front building line shall be as shown in the following tables: 
                  Minimum Residential Lot Dimensions and Area 

                   
                  ** Determination of minimum lot size will be made by the Environmental Division of the Whitfield County Health Department based upon suitability of the soils to support an on-site sewage management system. 
                  *** See subsection 15-34(4) for additional information. 
                  Minimum Commercial and Industrial Lot Dimensions and Area 

                   
                  ** Determination of minimum lot size will be made by the Environmental Division of the Whitfield County Health Department based upon suitability of the soils to support an on-site sewage management system. 
                  *** See subsection 15-34(4) for additional information. 
                  (Ord. of 9-24-01, § 3-4; Res. of 5-13-02; Ord. of 7-10-06; Res. of 1-9-07; Ord. of 3-19-07) 
                  Sec. 15-35. - Road design standards. 
                  All roads, whether public or private, which shall hereafter be established in connection with the development of a major subdivision shall comply with the Whitfield County Site Design Ordinance. 
                  (1)  Access to arterials and collectors. Where a subdivision borders upon or contains an existing or proposed arterial or collector route, as defined upon the Georgia Department of Transportation Functional Classification Map, it may be required that access to such road be limited by: 
                  a.  The subdivision of lots so as to back on the arterial or collector road and front on a parallel local road; 
                  b.  A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped roads, or short loops entered from and designed generally at right angles to such a parallel road, with the rear lines of their terminal lots backing onto the arterial or collector road; or 
                  c.  A frontage road. 
                  (2)  Reserve strips. The creation of reserve strips adjacent to a proposed road in such a manner as to deny access from adjacent property to such road shall generally not be permitted. However, in extraordinary circumstances, the Whitfield County Engineer may allow creation of a reserve strip to enable a more appropriate pattern of lots or roads. A notation to this effect shall be entered upon the final plat or approved as an auxiliary instrument attached thereto. 
                  (3)  Arrangement of continuing and dead-end roads. Temporary or permanent dead-end roads shall be designed as follows: 
                  a.  Arrangement of continuing roads. The arrangement of roads shall provide for the continuation of arterial and/or collector roads between adjacent properties when such continuation is necessary for convenient movements of traffic, effective fire protection, efficient provision of utilities, and when such continuation is in accordance with the arterial and/or collector road or road plan. If the adjacent property is undeveloped and the road must be a dead-end road temporarily, the right-of-way shall be extended to the property line. A temporary cul-de-sac, temporary "T", or "Y"-shaped turnabout shall be provided on all temporary dead-end roads as required in the following turnabout standards, with a notation on the subdivision plat that land outside the normal road right-of-way shall revert to abutting property owners whenever the road is continued. 
                  b.  Dead-end roads. Where a road does not extend beyond the boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not required by the Whitfield County Engineer for access to adjoining property, its terminus shall normally not be nearer to such boundary than 50 feet. However, the Whitfield County Engineer may require the reservation of an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage facilities, pedestrian traffic, or utilities. A cul-de-sac turnabout shall be provided at the end of a dead-end road in accordance with the Whitfield County Site Design Ordinance. 
                  (4)  Intersections. Intersections of new roads in a subdivision shall comply with the following standards: 
                  a.  Roads shall intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. A proposed intersection of two roads at an angle of less than 75 degrees shall not be permitted. An oblique road should be curved approaching an intersection and should be approximately at right angles for at least 100 feet therefrom. Not more than two roads shall intersect at any one point unless approved by the Whitfield County Engineer. 
                  b.  Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing road shall coincide, wherever practicable, with any existing intersections on the opposite side of such road. Where roads intersect arterial or collector routes, their alignment shall be continuous as specified in the Whitfield County Site Design Ordinance. 
                  c.  Minimum curve radius at the intersection of two local roads shall be specified as indicated in the Whitfield County Site Design Ordinance. Alley intersections and abrupt changes in alignment within a block shall have the corners cut off in accordance with standard engineering practice to permit safe vehicular movement. 
                  d.  Intersections shall be designed with flat grade wherever practical. In rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a leveling area shall be provided as specified in the Whitfield County Site Design Ordinance. 
                  (5)  Additional width on existing roads. In subdivisions which adjoin existing roads, the subdivider shall dedicate additional right-of-way to meet the minimum road width requirements as follows: 
                  a.  The entire right-of-way shall be provided where any part of the subdivision is on both sides of the road. 
                  b.  When the subdivision is located on one side of an existing road, one-half of the required right-of-way measured from the center line of the existing roadway, shall be provided. 
                  (6)  Road names. Roads which are extensions of or in alignment with existing named roads shall bear that name. The names of new roads shall be subject to the approval of the Whitfield County Building, Zoning and Development Department and shall not duplicate or be similar in sound to existing names irrespective of the use of the suffix road, avenue, circle, way, boulevard, drive, place, or court, etc. Whitfield County may regularly maintain a register of such names, accessible to the public, updated not less than monthly. 
                  (7)  Railroads and limited access highways. Railroad rights-of-way and limited access highways, where located so as to affect the subdivision of adjoining lands, shall be treated as follows: 
                  a.  In residential areas, a buffer strip at least 25 feet in depth in addition to the normally required depth of the lot may be required adjacent to a railroad right-of-way or limited access highway. This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated upon the plat: "This strip is reserved for buffers; the placement of structures hereon is prohibited." 
                  b.  In manufacturing or commercial areas, the nearest road extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad or limited access highway shall, wherever practical, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure suitable depth of manufacturing or commercial sites. 
                  c.  Roads parallel to a railroad or limited access highway, when intersecting a road which crosses the railroad at grade, shall, to the extent practical, be at a distance of at least feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients. 
                  (8)  Bridges. Bridges of primary benefit to the developer/subdivider, as determined by the Whitfield County Board of Commissioners, shall be constructed at the full expense of the developer/subdivider without reimbursement from Whitfield County. The sharing of expenses for the construction of bridges not of primary benefit to the developer/subdivider, as determined by the board of commissioners, may be fixed by special agreement between Whitfield County and the developer/subdivider. The cost shall be prorated to the developer/subdivider as to the percentage of his development so served. The engineering design of all bridges shall be reviewed and approved by the Whitfield County Engineer. 
                  (9)  Special purpose roads. 
                  a.  Half roads. Half roads are prohibited. Whenever a road is planned adjacent to the proposed lot or parcel boundary, the entire road right-of-way shall be platted within the proposed subdivision. 
                  b.  Split-level roads. Roads, which are constructed so as to have two traffic ways, each at a different level within the same right-of-way, shall provide a minimum right-of-way of 25 feet per traffic way and such additional right-of-way as necessary to meet the requirements of subsection 15-36(5), and a minimum paved traffic surface of 15 feet. The slope between the two traffic ways shall be not less than two to one. 
                  (10)  Road name signs. The developer shall be fully responsible for payment to Whitfield County for the installation of all road name signs, traffic control signs and any other signs as specified in the Whitfield County Site Design Ordinance. 
                  (Ord. of 9-24-01, § 3-5; Res. of 5-13-02; Ord. of 5-12-03, § 4; Ord. of 3-19-07) 
                  Sec. 15-36. - Stormwater drainage. 
                  (1)  The subdivider/developer shall provide adequate stormwater drainage in accordance with these regulations. The subdivider/developer shall also provide for adequate drainage all surface water drainage. 
                  (2)  The drainage system for a subdivision, residential, commercial, or manufacturing, shall be designed in accordance with sound engineering principles and procedures such that all marketable lots or parcels upon the plat are positively drained. 
                  (3)  The drainage system shall be designed to accommodate drainage from adjacent lots or parcels which naturally drain to or through the lands being subdivided. The drainage system shall be designed such that it does not affect the natural drainage onto adjacent parcels unless an agreement is obtained by the developer/subdivider from the owner of such adjacent parcels. A copy of any such agreement shall be submitted to the Whitfield County Engineer. 
                  (4)  Drainage facilities which are designed to accommodate flowing waters shall be hydraulically designed to function when subjected to the maximum flow rate which may be expected to occur no more often than once in ten years. 
                  (5)  Drainage facilities which are designed to handle water accumulations shall be designed to accommodate the maximum water level which may be expected to occur no more often than once in 25 years. Necessary drainage facilities including, but not limited to, culverts, rights-of-way, and easements, shall be offered for dedication to Whitfield County. 
                  (6)  All drainage systems discharging into any state waters, including but not limited to wetlands, as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, shall pass through an approved sedimentation and detention pond prior to such discharge. 
                  (7)  A master drainage plan shall be submitted to the Whitfield County Engineer simultaneously with the submittal of a preliminary plat. 
                  (Ord. of 9-24-01, § 3-3; Res. of 5-13-02) 
                  Sec. 15-37. - Utilities. 
                  (1)  Water supply and sanitary sewer. The public-governmental water system and sanitary sewer design, materials and construction methods shall be approved by Dalton Utilities, or other applicable governmental authority having jurisdiction. Where a public-governmental water supply and/or sanitary sewer system is available within 200 feet of any portion of any lot or parcel within the subdivision, all subdivisions and/or developments shall connect to such systems and shall provide every lot or parcel therein with public water and/or sewer as available. 
                  (2)  Water mains. When a water main is to be located in a road right-of-way and it will be necessary to cut into the road surface to serve the abutting lots, a connection shall be stubbed out to the property line to serve each lot before the road base is applied. 
                  (3)  Natural gas. When natural gas lines are located in a road right-of-way and it will be necessary to cut into the road surface to serve the abutting lots, a connection shall be stubbed out to the property line to serve each lot prior to applying the road base. 
                  (Ord. of 9-24-01, § 3-7; Res. of 5-13-02) 
                  Sec. 15-38. - Improvement maintenance security. 
                  (1)  Maintenance required. The developer/subdivider shall be required to maintain all public improvements in a development for a period of one year from the date of Whitfield County's acceptance of such infrastructure. 
                  (2)  Maintenance security form and amount. The developer shall post with the Whitfield County Administrator simultaneously with Whitfield County's acceptance of such infrastructure an irrevocable letter of credit or other acceptable security in an amount equal to ten percent of the total cost of the public improvements. The purpose of the security is to insure faithful maintenance of said installations and improvements by the developer. 
                  (3)  Call for security.

                  For purposes of this ordinance, Whitfield County is hereby divided into the following zoning districts: 
                  4-1-1 General agriculture (GA). This district is established to protect and to preserve agricultural and forest resources and associated rural characteristics by allowing only low density residential uses, farming, animal husbandry, forestry, saw milling, and other similar uses upon lots or parcels not less than five acres.

There shall be no manufactured or mobile homes within this district, in order to maintain the traditional residential character of such districts. Only one single-family dwelling unit per lot shall be allowed in this district. 
                  4-1-4 Low density single-family residential (R-2). This district is established to protect single-family detached dwellings, including typical residential subdivisions, on lots of not less than 27,500 square feet if served by on-site sewage management systems and not less than 15,000 square feet if served by public sewer or an approved central on-site sewage management system. All dwellings in this district shall contain in excess of 1,200 square feet of heated floor area upon a permanent foundation and shall have the electrical meter base serving such dwelling attached directly to such dwelling. There shall be no manufactured or mobile homes within this district in order to maintain the traditional residential character of such districts. If served by on-site sewage management system, the lots in this district shall conform at least with the minimum standards for lot sizes as promulgated by the health department or other authority having proper jurisdiction over such minimum lot sizes, as amended from time to time. Only one dwelling unit per lot shall be allowed in this district. 
                  4-1-5 Medium density single-family residential (R-3). This district is established to protect single-family detached dwellings, typically within a more urban atmosphere, including residential subdivisions, on smaller lots of not less than 7,500 square feet and which are served by public sewer or an approved central on-site sewage management system. All dwellings in this district shall contain not less than 1,000 square feet of heated floor area. There shall be no manufactured or mobile homes within this district, in order to maintain the traditional residential character of such districts. Only one dwelling unit per lot shall be allowed in this district. 
                  4-1-6 Zero lot line residential (R-4). This district is established for single-family detached dwellings, configured upon "zero lot lines," which may be located upon lots at a density of up to ten dwellings per acre, exclusive of right-of-ways or other restrictive easements. Any such lots must be served by public sewer or an approved central on-site sewage management system. Such districts encourage the creation of compatible open spaces for enjoyment by several surrounding dwellings. There shall be no manufactured or mobile homes within this district, in order to maintain the traditional residential character of such districts. Only one dwelling unit per lot shall be allowed in this district. 
                  4-1-7 Rural residential (R-5). This district is established to protect single-family detached dwellings, including typical residential subdivision development of all varieties of housing stock, and duplexes. Manufactured housing in this district shall remove all wheels and the tongue (or hitch,) so as to maintain the site-built residential character of the district. The lots in this zoning district that are served by on-site sewage management systems shall conform at least with the minimum standards for lot sizes as promulgated by the health department or other authority having proper jurisdiction over such minimum lot sizes, as amended from time to time. The lots in this zoning district that are served by public sewer or an approved central on-site sewage management system shall be not less than 7,500 square feet for a single-family dwelling and not less than 10,000 square feet for a duplex.

                  4-1-9 High density residential (R-7). This district is established as a high density residential district allowing as many as 20 dwelling units per acre. Multiple structures per lot shall be permitted in this district. Because of the increased density allowed in this district, any such lots must be served by public sewer or an approved central on-site sewage management system. 
                  4-1-10 Planned unit development (PUD). This district is established to permit greater flexibility and more imaginative design for the development of compatible, multi-use residential and neighborhood commercial land uses on a scale larger than not less than 15 acres. The PUD district is intended to promote an orderly and harmonious variety of housing options, along with higher levels of amenities and preservation of open space. To be considered for the PUD district, a full and complete application for rezoning shall include a preliminary site plan. Establishing a PUD district requires the implementation and adherence to the approved site plan as required by: 1) these regulations; 2) any other applicable regulations; or 3) any conditions resulting from the review process. Once submitted, if there are any material alterations to the site plan, the altered site plan shall be resubmitted. 
                  4-1-11 Limited commercial (C-1A). This transitional district is established to provide for specific limited commercial uses, including professional service establishments, often conducted within structures converted from residential uses. 
                  4-1-12 Neighborhood commercial (C-1). This district is established to provide for limited retail activities and personal or professional services designed to serve the convenience needs of nearby neighborhoods. The size of the buildings and parking allowed in this district are limited to create minimal negative impact upon nearby neighborhoods. This district allows uses which will result in a minimum of traffic from outside the surrounding neighborhoods. 
                  4-1-13 Mixed use (MU). This transition district is established to provide for appropriate mixed use opportunities on parcels smaller than those required for the PUD district. Typically, such uses would include apartment or condominium style multi-family housing situated above compatible retail/ service commercial or light manufacturing uses that are intended to serve such residents and the general public. However, the use(s) may also be entirely commercial or light manufacturing, creating more flexibility with respect to access, setbacks, etc., as shown on an approved site plan. To be considered for the MU district, a full and complete application for rezoning shall include a preliminary site plan. Establishing a MU district requires the implementation and adherence to the approved site plan as required by: 1) these regulations; 2) any other applicable regulations; or 3) any conditions resulting from the review process. Once submitted, if there are any material alterations to the site plan, the altered site plan shall be resubmitted. 
                  4-1-14 General commercial (C-2). This district is established to provide for and to encourage appropriate development along collector and arterial thoroughfares, which includes the broadest mix of commercial retail and service uses with associated storage capabilities, and other commercial activities which will both accommodate the needs of residents and those of the traveling public. Shopping centers and large retail stores would be common, along with a host of supporting commercial uses. 
                  4-1-15 Central business district (C-3). The central business district is the historic center of town, city, or community for commercial retail and service uses, financial institutions, office, and government uses, with limited residential uses. This district would typically be characterized by shared parking and loading, and by buildings occupying most, if not all, of the lot or parcel on which it is located. The central business district defines the core activity center around which the community has historically developed. 
                  4-1-16 Transitional commercial (C-4). This district is considered an expansion and transitional area out from the central business district, allowing uses similar to those allowed in the central business district, but with conventional lot designs, requiring off street parking and loading, and typical setbacks. This district is envisioned to accommodate lower traffic, lower visibility commercial operations that are nonetheless near the Central Business District. 
                  4-1-17 Light manufacturing (M-1). This district is established to act as a transition between heavy industrial uses and other commercial or residential uses by providing for industrial activities which are more limited in scope, size, or negative impacts upon surrounding properties. Permitted uses in this district will create a minimum of environmental pollution in the form of traffic, noise, odors, smoke, fumes, glare, or heat. 
                  4-1-18 Heavy manufacturing (M-2). This district is established to provide suitable areas for general industrial, carpet manufacturing, distribution, or warehousing activities and/or other intensive activities of industrial nature which may generate external traffic and may include moderate amounts of environmental pollution in the form of traffic, noise, odors, smoke, fumes, glare, or heat. 
                  4-2 - Zoning district map. 
                  The boundaries of the various zoning districts are shown upon that map designated as the Official Zoning Map of Whitfield County, Georgia, which is sometimes referred to as the "Zoning Map." The zoning map and all notations, references and other information shown thereon are a part of this ordinance and have the same force and effect as if the zoning map and all the notations, references, and other information shown thereon were fully set forth and described herein, which zoning map is properly attested and is on file with the clerks of Whitfield County and of each city, and with the zoning administrator, and is available for public inspection during normal business hours. 
                  4-3 - District boundaries. 
                  All roads, alleys, and railroad right-of-ways, if not otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be in the same zone as the property immediately abutting upon such alleys, roads and railroad right-of-way. Where the center line of a road, alley or railroad right-of-way serves as a district boundary, the zoning of such areas, unless otherwise specifically designated, shall be deemed to be the same as that of the abutting property up to such center line. Where district boundary lines are indicated as approximately following lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be such boundaries. Wherever any uncertainty exists as to the boundary line of any use district as shown on the zoning map incorporated herein, the following rules shall apply: 
                  4-3-1 Where a lot held in one ownership contains more than one actual principal use, such actual uses may be delineated and assigned zone designations consistent with such uses within the parcel. The existence of principal uses and the area assigned to such uses shall be based upon objective physical evidence of separate actual uses of the parcel present at the site at which it occurs. Any disputes regarding actual principal uses shall be resolved by the zoning administrator. 
                  4-3-2 In all other cases, the district boundary lines shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the official zoning map. 
                  4-3-3 Certain parcels located within any historic district designated by any historic preservation commission and noted on the Official Zoning Map shall also be subject to any regulation set forth by the applicable governing authority specifically related to historic properties or historic districts. 
                  4-4 - Permitted uses.

                  6-6 - Buffering tower sites. 
                  6-6-1 Tower sites shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials such that the view of the base of the tower is screened from any public rights-of-way, public property, and any GA, SA, R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6, or R-7 zoned property. 
                  6-6-2 In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, this landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived altogether by the unified board of zoning appeals. 
                  6-6-3 Existing mature growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as when towers are sited upon large, wooded lots, natural growth around the perimeter of the property may be sufficient if so determined by the board of zoning appeals. 
                  6-6-4 In buffer construction, native vegetation shall be preserved to the fullest extent possible. 
                  6-7 - Visual impact. 
                  6-7-1 Towers shall maintain a galvanized matte steel finish or be painted a neutral, earth toned color, unless otherwise required by the FAA. 
                  6-7-2 The design of maintenance/operation buildings and/or accessory structures at the tower site shall use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping which create the greatest level of compatibility with the natural environment and existing land use patterns. 
                  6-7-3 Antennae installed on an alternative tower structure and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment shall be of a neutral color which is similar to or complements the color of the alternative tower structure. 
                  6-7-4 Tower antennae shall be designed to be visually compatible with the exterior of the alternative tower structure to which they are to be attached. 
                  6-8 - Shared use/colocation. 
                  New tower sites may not be permitted if there is technically and commercially reasonable space available for shared use/colocation on a conforming preexisting tower. 
                  6-8-1 The application for a permit to develop a tower shall demonstrate that no existing tower or alternative tower structure can accommodate the proposed antenna. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or alternative tower structure can accommodate the proposed antenna shall consist of the following: 
                  (a)  Certification that no existing tower or alternative tower structures are located within the geographic area necessary to meet the applicant's engineering requirements. 
                  (b)  Certification that existing tower or alternative tower structures have insufficient height and cannot be modified to accommodate the applicant's engineering requirements. 
                  (c)  Certification that existing tower or alternative tower structures do not have sufficient integrity or strength and cannot be modified to support the proposed antenna and related equipment. 
                  (d)  Certification that the proposed antenna would cause interference with the antenna on the existing tower or alternative tower structure, or that the antenna on the existing tower or alternative tower structure would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
                  (e)  Certification that the fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or alternative tower structure or to adapt an existing tower or alternative tower structure for sharing unreasonably exceed market costs. 
                  (f)  The applicant demonstrates that there are other objective limitations which render existing towers unsuitable. 
                  6-8-2 Permit applicants for towers shall certify and demonstrate their intent to allow the shared use of such facilities with other tower apparatus which does not interfere with the primary purpose of the tower or such applicant shall document that the reserved space on the tower is to fulfill the owner's future needs. All applicants shall identify how the applicant will make available such shared use/co location. 
                  6-9 - Application procedures. 
                  Application for a permit for any tower, antenna, or use of an alternative tower structure shall be made to the zoning administrator.

                  ARTICLE VIII. - BUFFERS 

                  8-1 - Buffer requirement. 
                  A buffer, as specified herein below, shall be required when a proposed development abuts property in a less intense zone district, unless the adjacent zone district is already developed with uses similar to the proposed uses. Refer to the following table for the required buffer: 

                   
                  TBD — To be determined by the applicable governing body during the Special Use review approval process. 
                  8-1-1 Buffers shall be located within and along the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel along the side and/or rear lot lines. Buffers shall not be located upon any portion of existing, dedicated, or reserved public or private road right-of-way. 
                  8-1-2 No building permit shall issue for any lot or parcel development requiring a buffer until such time as that buffer, as specified herein, shall be substantially in place or until acceptable surety for the cost of the buffer installation shall be provided to the building inspector. Acceptable surety shall consist either of an irrevocable letter of credit from an approved lending institution or a performance bond from an approved insurer in an amount not less than $15.00 per linear foot of area to be buffered. The required buffer must be completed and in place within 30 days before any such surety shall lapse or within six months of the issuance of the building permit, whichever shall occur sooner. 
                  8-1-3 If the required buffer shall not be completed and in place as set forth herein, then, in such circumstance, the zoning administrator or designee shall have authority to go upon such areas of the subject parcel as reasonable and necessary to construct the required buffer, utilizing the surety previously provided. The governing authority shall not be liable for such action unless the zoning administrator or his or her designee shall act with gross negligence in coming upon and/or damaging such parcel. 
                  8-2 - Passive use. 
                  A buffer may be used for some forms of passive recreation such as pedestrian, bicycle, or equestrian trails; or a buffer may be used to locate a stormwater retention area provided that: 
                  8-2-1 No planted materials shall be eliminated. 
                  8-2-2 The total width of the buffer shall be maintained. 
                  8-2-3 A buffer shall not be used for any active recreational use such as playfields, stables, swimming pools and tennis courts. 
                  8-3 - More intense use must provide buffer. 
                  When adjoining properties are zoned in dissimilar use districts, the property within the more intensive use district shall be required to provide the buffer. However, when adjoining vacant parcels are in dissimilar use districts, no buffer is required when the parcel zoned for the less intensive use seeks a building permit. 
                  8-4 - General buffer design. 
                  All buffers required by this article shall conform to the following specifications: 
                  8-4-1 Prior to development, a buffer plan shall be required to show the types and locations of all screening devices within a required buffer. If a site development plan is required, a buffer plan may be incorporated as part of the site development plan. 
                  8-4-2 Landscaping within buffer areas shall be used to screen objectionable views or nuisances, such as parking and service areas, refuse containers, air conditioning units and transformers. Existing on site plantings may be credited as landscaped open space meeting the requirements of this section if such plant materials achieve the purposes of this section. 
                  8-5 - Zoning buffer standards. 
                  8-5-1 General. 
                  (a)  Buffer areas shall contain no driveways, access easements, parking areas, patios, storm water detention facilities, or any other structures or accessory uses except for a fence, wall or earthen berm constructed to provide the visual screening required to meet the standards of this article. 
                  (b)  Underground utilities including closed storm drains may be permitted to cross perpendicular to a buffer if the screening standards of this article will be subsequently achieved. 
                  (c)  Vehicular access through a buffer may be allowed only as a condition of rezoning, special use or planned unit development zoning approval by the governing authority. 
                  8-5-2 Minimum required screening. A required zoning buffer must create a barrier that substantially blocks the sight lines, noise transmission, and the transfer of artificial light and reflected light up to a height of not less than six feet at the property line (or such greater height as required by conditions of zoning approval on a particular property). 
                  8-5-3 Natural buffers. Natural buffers shall be composed of healthy plants with growth characteristics to produce a dense, compact visual screen not less than six feet in height. Natural buffers may contain deciduous or perennial vegetation, but shall contain existing or planted evergreen shrubs and trees suitable to local growing conditions that will provide an opaque visual screen during all seasons of the year. 
                  8-5-4 Structural buffers. A structural buffer shall provide a continuous visual screen throughout its entire length, and may consist of any combination of the following, as approved by the zoning administrator: Opaque fencing constructed of cedar, redwood, treated and stained or painted wood, vinyl replicating wood, or other suitable all-weather material; masonry walls of brick or stone; concrete block walls treated with a decorative finish; planted or natural vegetation; or earthen berms. Structural buffers shall meet the following criteria: 
                  (a)  Structural buffers shall be vegetated throughout the minimum area required for the buffer around any fences or walls and upon any earthen berms, which may include ground covers, shrubs and trees, and areas that are mulched. 
                  (b)  All earthen berms shall have a maximum side slope of 50 percent (one foot of vertical rise to two feet of horizontal run.) Earthen berms shall not be constructed within the drip line of any existing trees that will remain on the property; new trees that overhang the berm may be planted after the berm is constructed. 
                  (c)  Trees shall be located or planted within any structural buffer at a density of not less than one tree for each 25 feet of buffer length or portion thereof (or every 35 feet for shade trees). New deciduous trees shall have a caliper of not less than two inches upon planting, and new evergreens shall be at least six feet tall when planted. Trees may be clustered following professional landscaping standards for spacing, location and design 
                  (d)  Fences and freestanding walls shall present a finished and decorative appearance to the abutting property, and shall be located not closer to the property line than two feet. Shrubs, ground covers, or other vegetation shall be provided between the fence or wall and the property line so as to provide a decorative effect, following professional landscaping standards for spacing, location and design. 
                  (e)  Examples of buffers are shown in the following illustration: 

                  8-6 - Maintenance of buffers. 
                  Every buffer required under this article shall be maintained by the owner of the property where the buffer is located, so as to provide an opaque visual screen to a height of six feet on a continuous, year-round basis. Dead or dying plants or trees must be replaced immediately with the same or an equivalent species. 
                  8-7 - Reduction for unnecessary buffers. 
                  The governing authority may reduce a zoning buffer requirement to a temporarily appropriate level of screening if the comprehensive plan anticipates future development on the adjoining property in a land use category such that a zoning buffer would not be required or may be reduced by this ordinance once the adjoining property is rezoned or developed. such determination shall be based upon the future development map in the comprehensive plan, surrounding land use and zoning patterns, and the propriety of a future zoning change on the adjoining property. 
                  8-8 - Variances. 
                  The requirements of this article may be altered, amended, or waived by the unified board of zoning appeals, depending upon circumstances, if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence either that the existing topography and/or vegetation will achieve the purposes of the article or that, because of the topography, no required screening device could screen the ground level activities of the more intense use from the ground level activities of the abutting less intense use. 
                  ARTICLE IX. - NON-CONFORMING USE, STRUCTURE, OR LOT 

                  9-1 - Use of land. 
                  Any use of land legally established at the time of enactment or subsequent amendment of this ordinance, which would not be permitted as a new use in the zone district in which it is located, or any structure or accessory structure which is legally established at the time of enactment or subsequent amendment of this ordinance and is not built in conformity with the current requirements of this ordinance, or any lot of record whose area, frontage, width or other dimensions, or location which no longer meets or exceeds one or more such requirements of the applicable zoning district, may be continued pursuant to compliance with all of the following limitations: 
                  9-1-1 A non-conforming use may not be changed, altered, or amended to any other non-conforming use. 
                  9-1-2 A non-conforming use may not be re established after discontinuance of such use for a period of 12 months. 
                  9-1-3 A non-conforming use, structure, or accessory structure may not be enlarged beyond its size at the time it shall become non-conforming, nor shall the intensity of the use therein increase. This provision shall include, but shall not be limited to, the size of the building, the use of additional land, or the use of additional or more powerful equipment. Approval for such expansion of a non-conforming use shall require a successful rezoning of the lot or parcel in order to bring such use or parcel into compliance with this ordinance. This provision shall not apply to any residential addition onto an existing non-conforming single-family dwelling, provided such addition does not further encroach upon the required setback area. This provision also shall not apply to the replacement of an existing, non-conforming mobile or manufactured home used for residential purposes with another manufactured home, with the same or fewer bedrooms. 
                  9-1-4 A non-conforming structure may be rebuilt, altered without enlargement or expansion in any sense, repaired, or replaced at a size, use, or impact not larger than the original size and in substantially the same location for the same use within 12 months following damage or loss to such structure. This provision, however, shall not apply to condemnation or voluntary demolition, the effect of which shall be immediate forfeiture of the non-conforming use upon the affected lot or parcel or portion thereof. 
                  ARTICLE X. - ADMINISTRATION, ENFORCEMENT, AND PENALTIES 

                  10-1 - Administration by Zoning Administrator's Office. 
                  The provisions of this ordinance shall be administered by the zoning administrator, who is hereby given the authority to perform such functions and/or to designate such other persons as he or she shall deem necessary to administer and to enforce the requirements of this ordinance, including, but not limited to, the issuance of stop work orders, the issuance of citations (in any appropriate form) to the Whitfield County Magistrate Court for violation hereof, and the seeking of injunctive relief in the Whitfield County Superior Court. 
                  10-2 - Fees. 
                  A schedule of permit, application, and/or use fees, as adopted from time to time by the governing authority, shall be attached hereto as Appendix "A." 
                  10-3 - Permit. 
                  It shall be unlawful to commence the excavation or filling of any lot for the construction of any structure which requires a permit to build or to commence construction of any structure which requires a permit to build or to commence the moving or alteration of any structure which requires a permit to build or to commence the development or improvement of land for a use not requiring a structure until a permit has issued for all such work. 
                  10-4 - Enforcement. 
                  The zoning administrator, any code enforcement officer, or any duly authorized Whitfield County Sheriff's Deputy or city police officer within the applicable municipality, or the lawful designee of any such person, shall have the authority to issue citations for violations of this ordinance. Any such person shall investigate every written complaint received which shall charge that a specific lot or parcel is not in compliance herewith. 
                  10-5 - Owner, occupant, or tenant may be cited. 
                  An owner, as shown by the records of the Whitfield County Tax Assessor's Office, or any occupant, tenant, or other person in lawful possession of any lot, parcel, or premises determined to be in violation hereof may be cited therefor. 
                  10-6 - Continuing violation. 
                  Any violation of this ordinance shall be considered a continuing violation, subject to separate citation each day in which such violation remains. 
                  10-7 - Penalties for violation. 
                  Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(b,) any person convicted of violating this ordinance or any provision thereof shall be sentenced to a maximum fine of $1,000.00 or imprisonment for a term of 60 days, or both. Every day a violation continues shall be subject to a separate penalty. 
                  10-8 - Remedies—Injunctive relief. 
                  When any structure or accessory structure which is erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted or maintained; or any structure, accessory structure, land use, or land condition violates any portion of this ordinance, the zoning administrator or his or her designee may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction. Such remedy shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any similar remedy which adjacent or neighboring property holders may already have pursuant to the laws of Georgia and shall have no effect thereon. 
                  10-9 - Remedies—Effect of noncompliance; Notice and hearing before governing authority. 
                  In addition to any other remedies provided hereunder, so as to promote the health, morals, safety, and general welfare of the residents of Whitfield County, if the owner, occupant, tenant, lessee, and/or any other person in lawful possession of any lot, parcel, or premises shall fail to maintain such parcel in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance, the zoning administrator, if he or she shall choose to proceed pursuant to the purview of this section, shall notify in writing all such person(s), specifically including, but not limited to, the owner of record, as may be reasonably determined by records contained in the Whitfield County Tax Assessor's Office, by certified mail, return receipt requested, that such person(s) shall have 30 days from receipt of such notice in which to bring such lot, parcel, or premises into conformity with the provisions of this ordinance. If such notice shall be returned "unclaimed" or is otherwise undeliverable, then notice by publication in the The Daily Citizen (Dalton, Georgia) once a week for four consecutive weeks shall constitute due and proper notice as of the date of the fourth publication. Notice, whether by mail or by publication, shall advise with reasonable specificity the condition(s) which do not comply with the provisions of this ordinance. Such notice shall further advise that if no response is forthcoming within 30 days, the zoning administrator shall cause such matter to be placed upon the agenda of the next regularly scheduled meeting of the governing authority for public hearing. At such hearing, the zoning administrator or designee shall advise the governing authority of the unlawful condition(s) thereon and then the governing authority shall hear any other person(s) wishing to address it with regard to the condition of the lot, parcel, or premises. The governing authority shall then determine whether it shall cause such condition(s) to be brought into compliance with the provisions of this ordinance, as the particular facts may warrant, and whether it shall cause the costs of such efforts to be charged against the lot or parcel upon which the condition existed as a real property lien and/or cause to be levied as a special tax against the land upon which such conditions existed and/or to recover such costs in an action at law against the owner of such lot or parcel. 
                  10-10 - Adoption and amendments. 
                  The governing authorities of Whitfield County and the municipalities of Dalton and Varnell shall adopt this ordinance and the zoning map that is part of this ordinance only after public notice(s) and public hearing(s) and final action of each governing authority, as required by the adopted Zoning Procedures and Standard Ordinance of the respective governments. 
                  Further, the governing authorities may from time to time amend the text of this ordinance or the Official Zoning Map that is part of this ordinance, according to the procedures in their respective Zoning Procedures and Standards Ordinance, which is included herein in Appendix "E." Appendix E fully describes all applicable final zoning decisions as defined by state law, including but not limited to rezoning, special use review, and annexation, the notice and posting requirements to the public, the procedures for conducting the public hearings, the standards used to review zoning decisions, and the procedures to obtain a final zoning decision. 
                  10-10-1 Application process. Any amendment to the text of this ordinance or the zoning map or any final action upon any other zoning decision shall begin upon an application form. Annexations shall begin on a form provided by the respective municipal governments and all other zoning decisions shall begin on a form provided by the zoning administrator. Such application forms shall include a listing of any and all requirements for consideration of any matter requiring a final zoning decision. Failure to comply with the requirements of the application shall constitute an incomplete application which will not be processed for conclusion of the requested final zoning decision. An application fee, which is established by the governing authority of the county or the municipalities, as applicable, may apply and be adjusted from time to time. Failure of the zoning administrator or city clerks, as applicable, to collect a fee from the governing authority or the respective municipalities or from the planning commission (or equivalent), when they are initiating a proposed zoning decision, shall not void the validity of the application. 
                  10-11 - Conflict with other laws. 
                  Whenever the regulations of this ordinance require a greater width or size of yards, building, or smaller number of stories, or require a greater percentage of a lot to be left unoccupied, or impose other more restrictive standards than are required in or pursuant to any other statute, law, rule, or regulation, the requirements of this ordinance shall govern. Whenever the provisions of any other statute require more restrictive standards than are required by this ordinance, the provisions of such statute shall govern. 
                  10-12 - Separability. 
                  Should any section or provision of this ordinance be declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional or invalid, such declaration shall not affect the validity of the ordinance as a whole or any part thereof other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
                  10-13 - Repeal of conflicting ordinances and validity of prior approvals and actions. 
                  All ordinances and parts of ordinances in conflict herewith are repealed. 
                  10-13-1 This is the Unified Zoning Ordinance, and all other conflicting ordinances or resolutions are hereby repealed; provided, that nothing herein shall be construed as repealing or modifying the condition of operation or conditions of site development accompanying those zoning approvals or use permits issued under previous zoning ordinances or resolutions; however, modification or repeals of these past conditions of approval may be accomplished as provided by this ordinance. 
                  10-13-2 Except as otherwise provided herein with respect to non-conforming uses, all variances and exceptions heretofore granted by the respective planning commission or unified board of zoning appeals shall remain in full force and effect and all terms, conditions and obligations imposed by the respective planning commissions, unified board of zoning appeals, or governing authority shall remain in full force and effect and be binding. Prior ordinances shall remain in effect insofar as required for the initiation of any proceedings against violations thereof and for the prosecution of any violations heretofore commenced. 
                  10-13-3 Notwithstanding anything contained herein and notwithstanding any zoning classification change, all previous special stipulations, conditions, restrictions, agreements and terms contained in prior zoning ordinances shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be amended by this document and shall carry forward to any new zoning classification and shall be binding upon said property. Prior ordinances shall remain in effect and shall remain as such special stipulations, conditions, restrictions, agreements and terms, even though the zoning category itself may be changes hereunder.

                  --- (2) --- 
                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 0509, § 11, adopted May 9, 2016, amended the title of Art. XI to read as set out herein. The former Art. XI title pertained to board of zoning appeals. 

                  11-1 - Appointment. 
                  The Unified Board of Zoning Appeals for the City of Dalton, City of Varnell, and for Whitfield County is hereby created. 
                  11-1-1 The membership of the board shall consist of five members. 
                  11-1-2 The City of Dalton and Whitfield County shall appoint two members each, and the City of Varnell shall appoint one member. Each governing authority shall appoint members with overlapping terms. One member each from Whitfield County and the City of Dalton shall be appointed initially to a five-year term. One member each from Whitfield County and the City of Dalton shall be appointed initially to a four-year term. The City of Varnell member shall be appointed initially to a three-year term. Thereafter, each appointment shall be for a five-year term. If the City of Varnell shall fail to appoint its member within 60 days of notice of expiration of the term, then Whitfield County shall make such appointment for the applicable term. 
                  11-1-3 A member of the board shall be appointed to not more than two consecutive full terms. 
                  11-1-4 A member shall serve at the pleasure of the appointing governing authority and may be removed from the board by a majority vote of the governing authority that appointed the member in the event of absenteeism at three successive called meetings or for other reasons the governing authority may deem appropriate. 
                  11-1-5 When a position becomes vacant before the end of a term, the governing authority that appointed the vacating member shall appoint a new member for the duration of the term remaining consistent with the original appointment. 
                  (Ord. No. 0509, §§ 11, 12, 5-9-16) 
                  11-2 - Powers and duties. 
                  The board shall have the following powers and duties: 
                  11-2-1 To hear and to decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by any representative, officer, or agent of the applicable governing authority. Any such reversal shall be based upon reliable evidence adduced at the hearing, as provided for below, that such decision was erroneous under the facts as the board finds them to be and under the board's reasonable interpretation of the provisions of this ordinance; 
                  11-2-2 To authorize, upon request in specific cases, such variance from the regulations or requirements of this ordinance, as the case may be, as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance will, in such individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed, public welfare and safety secured, and substantial justice done. In order to grant a variance from the requirements of this ordinance, the board must find that every one of the following conditions is met: 
                  (a)  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography; 
                  (b)  The application of this ordinance to the particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship; 
                  (c)  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; 
                  (d)  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of this ordinance, provided, however, that no variance may be granted for the use of land or building or structure which is prohibited by this ordinance or for an increase in the density allowed by this ordinance. 
                  (e)  The applicant must provide either formal or informal written evidence that the intended use, if a variance were granted, would be allowed, either by the Whitfield County Health Department or Dalton Utilities, as applicable, with respect to wastewater treatment. 
                  11-3 - Procedures. 
                  Any person having a legal interest in affected property, or his or her attorney-in-fact, shall have standing to file an appeal or variance request to the board. The appeal or variance request shall be filed upon forms provided by the office of the zoning administrator. The office of the zoning administrator may charge a reasonable fee for the filing of such appeal or variance request, so as to defray the costs of advertisement and case preparation. Any such fee shall be paid with the filing of the notice of appeal or variance request. 
                  11-3-1 The request for an appeal or variance shall be either hand delivered or mailed and must be received by the office of the zoning administrator on or before the 30th day following denial of a permit. 
                  11-3-2 If the 30th day falls upon a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the appeal or variance request shall be due on the next business day upon which the office of the zoning administrator is open to the public. 
                  11-3-3 An appeal or variance request not received by the office of the zoning administrator on or before the 30th day following decision or determination shall be considered untimely and shall be automatically denied. 
                  11-3-4 A timely filed appeal or variance request shall stay all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action from which the appeal is taken unless the zoning administrator or his/her agent shall certify by sworn affidavit, a copy of which shall be provided to the appellant, that a stay would cause imminent peril to life and/or property. In such circumstance, there shall be no stay unless ordered by any court of competent jurisdiction. 
                  11-3-5 At least 15 days but not more than 45 days prior to the public hearing date, a written notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the territorial boundaries of the county, setting forth the time, place, and purpose of the hearing. In addition, a sign shall be placed in a conspicuous location upon the lot or parcel for which a variance is sought, setting forth the time, place, and purpose of the public hearing. Acts of vandalism or natural occurrences limiting the effectiveness of such notice shall not invalidate any proceeding or action taken upon the proposed variance. 
                  11-3-6 The appellant may represent himself or herself before the board or may be represented by an attorney at law, a registered land surveyor, and/or other engineers or professionals, as he or she deems appropriate or helpful. The appellant may not be represented by a layperson unless such person shall be the appellant's attorney-in-fact. 
                  11-3-7 The order of proceeding shall be as follows: An authorized representative of the office of the zoning administrator shall first present all of his or her reasons for the order, requirement, decision, or determination being appealed or requested for a variance. In presenting said reasons, such representative shall present all of the findings of fact and conclusions of law that form the bases for said decision. Then the individual appellant shall present his or her grounds for requesting a waiver or variance, calling witnesses if desired. Any member of the Board may question any witness at any point during the proceeding. Following all witnesses, either side may present rebuttal testimony. At the conclusion of the evidence, the chair may give both sides an opportunity to summarize briefly if the chair shall deem it helpful. 
                  11-3-8 Hearings before the board shall not be governed by the strict rules of evidence as in a court of law, though the chair shall be empowered to disallow any evidence or testimony deemed by him or her to be irrelevant, speculative, or otherwise inappropriate to the issues being heard. Any remark amounting to an attack upon the character or personal integrity of another individual or comment not actually supportable or comment in the form of an emotional outburst shall be non-germane to the purpose of the hearing and shall be ruled out of order by the chair. The chair shall have the authority to remove or censure any person who continues to make such comments or who is otherwise disruptive to the hearing process. 
                  11-3-9 The deliberation and vote by the board must be made in open session, either upon motion and second at the meeting at which the appeal or variance request is presented or at any subsequent regular or special called meeting of the board. The board shall make a decision not later than either 35 days following the initial hearing upon any appeal or variance request or 90 days from the time the application for appeal or variance is filed with the office of the zoning administrator, or said request shall be deemed granted. 
                  The appellant shall be notified in writing at the address provided in the appeal or variance request within 15 days of the decision of the board. 
                  11-3-10 Should the individual appellant desire to appeal any decision of the board, he or she must do so by Writ of Certiorari directly to the Whitfield County Superior Court within 30 days of such decision. There shall be no intermediate appeal to the applicable governing authority, or to any other administrative body. 
                  11-3-11 Any appellant whose appeal or variance request shall be denied by the board shall be required to wait not less than six months before seeking an appeal or variance for the same real property and/or for the same or similar request. Such waiting period shall apply to any agent for appellant, co-owner with appellant, or successor in appellant's interest. 
                  No principal building, structure, or land use shall be permitted except in the zoning districts indicated and for the purposes permitted in the Permitted Use Table. A principal use is permitted by right in any district denoted by the letter "X" and may be subject to additional requirements as indicated in the table, other requirements of state law, and other applicable regulations of this ordinance. A principal use denoted by the letter "S" is permitted only if a special use (conditional use) approval is granted by the applicable governing authority after required review as specified in the Unified Zoning Procedures and Standards Ordinance. For principal uses not included on this list, where after discussion and agreement the building inspector, zoning administrator, planning staff, and legal counsel of the applicable governing authority are unable to determine placement due to similarity of use, application shall be made to the unified board of zoning appeals for interpretation. Failure of the board to determine similarity shall result in a denial of the principal use that is not on the list, until such time that the Zoning Ordinance shall be properly amended and determine the applicable zone district(s) for such use.

                  In addition to the requirements of subsection 1 5.1, if the proposed amendment to the Zoning Ordinance and/or zoning map or proposed special use calls for a zoning decision for the rezoning of a lot or parcel or for the granting of a Special Use thereon, and the proposed amendment or proposed special use is initiated other than by the governmental authority, the following additional conditions apply: 
                  (i)  The published notice shall include the general location of the lot or parcel and shall state the present zoning classification of the lot or parcel and the proposed zoning classification of the lot or parcel or proposed Special Use sought. 
                  (ii)  A sign shall be placed by the zoning administrator in a conspicuous location upon the lot or parcel sought to be rezoned or for which a special use is sought, setting forth the time, place, and purpose of the public hearing, the present zoning classification of the lot or parcel, and the proposed zoning classification or proposed special use. Acts of vandalism or natural occurrences limiting the effectiveness of such notice shall not invalidate any proceeding or action taken upon the proposed amendment. 
                  (iii)  For subject properties within the unincorporated area of Whitfield County, the zoning administrator shall reasonably attempt to notify each owner of a lot or parcel abutting and/or adjoining the subject property proposed for amendment to the zoning map or special use by mailing to each such adjoining owner a copy of the application for amendment to the Zoning Map or Special Use by regular United States mail. In determining the name, address and ownership of each abutting and/or adjoining lot or parcel entitled to notice, the zoning administrator or its designee may conclusively rely upon the records of the office of the Whitfield County Tax Assessor as of the date of the filing of the application for amendment to the zoning map or application for special use with the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator's office may place reasonable requirements upon the applicant to assist in obtaining accurate information concerning adjoining owners and shall require the applicant to reimburse actual mailing costs. The determination by the zoning administrator that the requirements of this Section 1-5.2(iii) have been satisfied shall be final.

                  SECTION 1-6 - PUBLIC HEARING FOR AMENDMENTS TO THE ZONING ORDINANCE AND/OR ZONING MAP AND FOR SPECIAL USE APPROVAL: 
                  A public hearing upon any proposed amendment to the Zoning Ordinance and/or zoning map or special use shall be provided for by the Dalton Whitfield Planning Commission. A public hearing upon any proposed Amendment to the Zoning Ordinance and/or Zoning Map of Whitfield County or Special Use properly initiated shall be conducted at the time and place as set forth in subsection 1-5.1. Any affected governmental authority may, at its discretion, join the Dalton Whitfield County Planning Commission during the public hearing process, such that both bodies simultaneously are present for such public hearing(s). The chairman of the Dalton-Whitfield County Planning Commission shall conduct such public hearing(s), unless he or she shall designate that another person shall serve as chair of the proceedings for such public hearing(s). The purpose of such public hearing(s) shall be to present to the public any proposed amendment to the Zoning Ordinance and/or zoning map or special use and to receive comments thereon from the public. The governing authority shall consider the comments presented by the public at such public hearing(s) in making their respective decisions on the proposed amendment to the Zoning Ordinance and/or zoning map or special use in accordance with the standards as enumerated in section 1-8 or 1-9 of this ordinance, as applicable. 
                  (Ord. No. 2015-08102, 8-10-15) 
                  SECTION 1-7 - CONDUCT AND PROCEDURES OF PUBLIC HEARINGS HELD BEFORE THE WHITFIELD COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS AND THE DALTON WHITFIELD COUNTY PLANNING COMMISSION: 
                  The following policies and procedures shall govern the conduct of hearings before the Dalton Whitfield County Planning Commission and the governmental authority if jointly convened (the joint hearing body is hereinafter, the "joint panel"). 
                  SECTION 1-7.1 
                  The chairman of the Dalton-Whitfield County Planning Commission or his or her designee (hereinafter, "the chair") shall open the hearing(s) with an explanation of the purpose of the hearing(s) and a description of the general rules for the conduct of the hearing(s). The chair may describe the authority and role of both the Dalton Whitfield County Planning Commission, in providing a recommendation only, and of the governmental authority, for final action, in any zoning decision. An individual requesting to be heard upon a matter germane to the purpose of the hearing must be called and recognized by the chair before addressing the joint panel. The chair shall determine the germaneness of any proposed comment or presentation and is authorized to rule any individual or portion of the presentation out of order if not germane to the published purpose of the hearing. Any person recognized by the chair, shall first state his name and residence address before proceeding with any comment, remarks, or presentation. Any person addressing the joint panel shall respond to questions from the chair or anyone he or she shall recognize. The chair may predetermine the length of any hearing, allotting equal time to proponents and opponents of any proposed amendment to the Zoning Ordinance and/or zoning map or special use to the extent that there are both proponents and opponents who desire to be heard. The chair shall be required to offer equal time to both the proponents and opponents of any proposed amendment to the Zoning Ordinance and/or zoning map or special use and the fact that equal time is not in fact utilized by either shall not invalidate any proceeding or action taken upon any proposed amendment to the Zoning Ordinance and/or zoning map or special use. The chair, however, shall allow a minimum time period no less than ten minutes per side for the presentation of data, evidence, and opinion. 
                  SECTION 1-7.2 
                  A proposed amendment to the Zoning Ordinance and/or zoning map or special use applications may be called in any order in the discretion of the chair. The chair shall confirm that proper public notice of the public hearing(s) in accordance with the provisions or this article has been given prior to taking any comments from the public. 
                  SECTION 1-7.3 
                  The chair shall allow the person initiating the proposed amendment to the Zoning Ordinance and/or zoning map or special use, or his or her designee (hereinafter, "the applicant,") to present a description of the request and the reason(s) supporting it. The failure of the applicant to be present for the hearing when called shall result in an automatic continuance in the public hearing thereon until the next regular monthly meeting of the Dalton-Whitfield County Planning Commission, with public notice thereof to all in attendance. Additionally, the zoning administrator shall re-post the sign setting forth the new public hearing date. The failure of the applicant to be present for the hearing when called at the next meeting of the Dalton-Whitfield County Planning Commission shall result in an automatic negative decision from the governing authority when such request shall come before it. 
                  SECTION 1-7.4 
                  The chair shall enter into the record after the presentation of the applicant any written comment, petition or similar written statement, photographs, or any other evidence submitted during the public hearing and such documents and/or exhibits shall be considered by the Dalton-Whitfield County Planning Commission, and subsequently by the governing authority in its analysis of the relevant zoning standards and factors as set forth in Section 1-8 or 1-9 of this ordinance, as applicable. 
                  SECTION 1-7.5 
                  The chair shall then give persons opposed to the proposed amendment to the Zoning Ordinance and/or zoning map or special use the opportunity to address the assembled panel. 
                  SECTION 1-7.6 
                  The chair may then alternate the presentation of persons speaking in favor of and opposed to the proposal, beginning with the applicant, or the chair may divide such presentation into blocks of time beginning with the proponents and thereafter move into the presentation of the opponents, if any. The chair may poll the public assemblage at the hearing concerning its concurrence with the remarks of any speaker. 
                  SECTION 1-7.7 
                  Any remark amounting to an attack on the character or personal integrity of another individual or comment not actually supportable or comment in the form of emotional outburst shall be non germane to the purpose of the hearing and may be ruled out of order. The chair shall have the power to remove or censure any person who continues to make any remarks amounting to an attack on the character or personal integrity of another individual or any comment not factually supportable or any comment in the form of emotional outburst during the proceeding. 
                  SECTION 1-7.8 
                  Upon the conclusion of the presentation of persons, if any, opposing the proposed amendment to the Zoning Ordinance and/or zoning map or special use, the chair may grant to the applicant an allotted time for rebuttal of any new issues raised by opponents, if any. The chair may rule out of order the raising of any new issues in rebuttal unless he or she shall determine that the raising of such new issue is useful to the purpose of the hearing, in which case opponents, if any, shall be allotted an equal amount of time to address such issue(s). 
                  SECTION 1-7.9 
                  When the applicant/proponent(s) and opponents, if any, have been heard in accordance with the foregoing procedures, the chair shall declare the public hearing closed. No further public hearing upon the proposed amendment to the Zoning Ordinance and/or zoning map or special use shall be permitted prior to the final zoning decision by the governing authority, unless the governing authority shall determine that such public hearing should be re opened for the presentation of additional information, in which case the same must be advertised in conformity with subsection 1-5.1. 
                  (Ord. No. 2015-08102, 8-10-15) 
                  SECTION 1-8 - ZONING STANDARDS: 
                  Exercise of zoning power by the governing authority shall constitute an effort to balance the interests of Whitfield County in promoting the public health, safety, morality, and/or general welfare against the right of lot or parcel owners to the unrestricted use of their lot or parcel. The following factors are determined to be relevant in balancing the interest and promoting the public health, safety, morality, and/or general welfare against the right to unrestricted use of lot or parcel: 
                  SECTION 1-8.1 "FACTORS" 
                  SECTION 1-8.1(A) 
                  Whether the proposed amendment would allow a use that is generally suitable for the site compared to other possible uses and whether the proposed change is consistent with the established land use pattern and zoning of adjacent and nearby properties. 
                  SECTION 1-8.1(B) 
                  Whether the proposed amendment would adversely affect the economic value or the uses of adjacent and nearby properties. 
                  SECTION 1-8.1(C) 
                  Whether the subject property has a reasonable economic use as currently zoned, considering the suitability of the subject property for the proposed zoned uses. 
                  SECTION 1-8.1(D) 
                  Whether there is relative gain to the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the public as compared to any hardship imposed upon the individual owner under the existing zoning. 
                  SECTION 1-8.1(E) 
                  Whether the proposed amendment, if adopted or approved, would result in a use which would or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, schools, sewers, water resources, police and fire protection, or other utilities, as contrasted with the impact under the existing zoning. 
                  SECTION 1-8.1(F) 
                  Whether the property sought to be rezoned (or annexed) is in conformity with the policy and intent of the adopted joint comprehensive plan or equivalent. If not, has the plan already been amended, officially or unofficially, by the development of uses which are contrary to the plan recommendation, and if the plan has been amended, does this rezoning or annexation request allow uses which are compatible to the existing uses in the vicinity. 
                  SECTION 1-8.1(G) 
                  Whether there are any other conditions or transitional patterns affecting the use and development of the property to be rezoned or annexed, which give grounds for approval or disapproval of the proposed zoning proposal. Whether the proposed zoning change constitutes an "entering wedge" and is a deterrent to the use, improvement, or development of adjacent property within the surrounding zone districts or would create an isolated, unrelated district (spot zone) as interpreted by current Georgia law. 
                  SECTION 1-8.1(H) 
                  Whether the subject property, as currently zoned, is vacant and undeveloped for a long period of time, considered in the context of land development in the vicinity or whether there are environmental or cultural factors, like steep slopes, flood plain, storm water, or historical issues, that influence the development of the subject property under any zoning designation. 
                  SECTION 1-8.2 
                  The governing authority shall consider any proposed zoning amendment properly initiated in light of the factors set forth in Section 1-8.1. In evaluating the factors set forth in [Section] 1-8.1, it shall be the policy of the governing authority to exercise its zoning power in conformity with the policy intent of the Joint Comprehensive Plan for Whitfield County and the cities of Dalton and Varnell insofar as that plan is current in its application to the specific subject lot or parcel sought to be rezoned. It is further the policy of the governing authority to exercise the zoning power for the purposes of assuring the compatibility of use of adjacent and nearby properties and the preservation of the economic value of adjacent, abutting, and nearby properties while enabling a reasonable use of all lot or parcel within the territorial boundaries of the governmental entity.

                  As set forth in Section 10-10-1 of the Unified Zoning Ordinance, a request for a special use shall be duly evaluated pursuant to the following factors, which are intended to be objective in character:

                  SECTION 1-9.1(A) 
                  Whether the proposed use would impact upon anticipated traffic volume and/or traffic flow and/or pedestrian safety within the vicinity; 
                  SECTION 1-9.1(B) 
                  Whether the hours and manner of operation of the proposed use would impact upon nearby properties and uses within the vicinity; 
                  SECTION 1-9.1(C) 
                  Whether parking, loading/service, and/or refuse areas of the proposed use would impact upon nearby properties and uses within the vicinity, particularly with regard to noise, light, glare, smoke, and/or odor; 
                  SECTION 1-9.1(D) 
                  Whether the height, size, and/or location of any proposed structure is compatible with the height, size, and/or location of structure(s) upon nearby properties and uses within the vicinity; 
                  SECTION 1-9.1(E) 
                  Whether the size of the lot or parcel is sufficiently large for the proposed use, and for reasonable growth opportunity of such proposed use, within the parameters of the Zoning Ordinance and within the probable limits of the soils thereon if an on site sewage system is to be installed; 
                  SECTION 1-9.1(F) 
                  Whether the benefits of and need for the proposed use are, on balance, greater than reasonable anticipated depreciating effects and/or damages, if any, to nearby properties within the vicinity.

                  SECTION 1-10 - OFFICIAL ACTION BY THE GOVERNING AUTHORITY: 
                  Consideration of any proposed amendment to the Zoning Ordinance and/or zoning map or special use properly initiated and subsequent to the public hearing(s) shall be as follows: 
                  SECTION 1-10.1 
                  After the close of all the public hearings, the Dalton Whitfield County Planning Commission shall make a recommendation, which shall later be reduced to writing, to the applicable governmental authority, as to the advisability of adoption of any proposed amendment to the Zoning Ordinance and/or zoning map or special use, and which shall be based upon the "Factors" set forth in Section 1-8 or 1-9, as applicable. 
                  SECTION 1-10.2 
                  If consideration of any proposed amendment to the Zoning Ordinance and/or zoning map or special use shall be tabled by the Dalton Whitfield County Planning Commission, it shall be reconsidered not later than its next regular monthly meeting. Under any circumstances, however, if no recommendation shall be forthcoming within 60 days of the date upon which the advertisement of the public hearing referenced in Section 1-5.1 hereinabove, it shall be deemed that the recommendation of the Dalton Whitfield County Planning Commission shall have been favorable to the request. 
                  SECTION 1-10.3 
                  The authority of the Dalton Whitfield County Planning Commission regarding any zoning decision shall be advisory only. However, the governing authority shall await either such recommendation or the 60 days referenced in Section 1-10.2 hereinabove prior to taking final action upon any such proposed amendment to the Zoning Ordinance and/or zoning map or special use. 
                  SECTION 1-10.4 
                  If the governing authority shall take official action defeating a proposed amendment to the Zoning Map which seeks to rezone a lot or parcel or Special Use, the same property may not be considered again for rezoning or for a Special Use until the expiration of 12 months from the date of the official action of the governing authority. This subsection shall specifically include, but not be limited to, an automatic denial due to the failure of the applicant to appear at the public hearing when called.

                  SECTION 1-11 - ANNEXATION OF UNINCORPORATED ISLANDS BY MUNICIPALITIES:

Any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration or improvements to a building, taking place during the life of a building, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the building as of February 16, 1990, or as of the first time thereafter that any such repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements commenced, whichever is later. The market value of the building should be (1) the appraised value of the building prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the building prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary or safety code specifications which have been identified by the code enforcement official and which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions.

                  2. - GENERAL LEVEL OF SERVICE STANDARDS 

                  2.1. - Detention Requirements. 
                  2.1.1. Discharge rates from new development projects. 
                  Development plans including site grading and drainage plans should be developed to minimize disruption of natural drainage patterns on properties as well as to minimize impacts to downstream drainage infrastructure and structures. Whenever a hydrologic and hydraulic report (as defined in section 8 of this document) indicates a potentially adverse impact resulting from development of a property on a downstream property, that project shall incorporate stormwater detention facilities to reduce the discharge rate. The meaning of adverse impact shall apply to situations where the post development discharge rates, up to and including the 100-year storm event, exceed those determined for the pre-developed conditions. Additionally, no increases in stormwater runoff rates shall be allowed at any discharge point from the site unless approved by the county engineer. 
                  The baseline or pre-developed conditions shall be on an analysis of the existing conditions taking into account existing land use, stormwater management controls and other factors that can affect the hydrologic responsiveness of the site. Proposed developments shall be analyzed for the following storm events: 
                  • 1-year 24-hour Design Storm. 
                  • 2-year 24-hour Design Storm. 
                  • 5-year 24-hour Design Storm. 
                  • 10-year 24-hour Design Storm. 
                  • 25-year 24-hour Design Storm. 
                  • 50-year 24-hour Design Storm. 
                  • 100-year 24-hour Design Storm. 
                  If the total area of the site (i.e. total property area) and the drainage area to each stormwater management facility is less than one acre, then a rainfall intensity based analysis (i.e. rational method) may be performed. However, if detention facilities are to be designed and constructed in series, the 24-hour storm criteria will apply regardless of the drainage area. 
                  Where downstream conditions indicate that the conveyance and/or storage capacity of existing infrastructure could be impacted by the post development conditions, or where existing structures could be impacted by the post developed conditions, a more stringent standard may be required. For example, if the project site drains into an existing detention pond within the study area then the designer will be required to demonstrate that the discharge rates from the proposed development will still allow the detention pond to operate at a level commiserate with the site in an undeveloped state. 
                  Detention facilities should be designed upon the basis of known or projected developments (proposed by the developer) for the contributing drainage basin. Although, the developer is only required to construct the facility with sufficient volume to provide detention for the proposed development, a design shall be provided to the county engineer demonstrating the ultimate configuration of the facility at full build-out. Additionally, the proposed site plan should have sufficient land around the facility reserved to construct the ultimate configuration without significant demolition. 
                  2.1.2. Discharge rates from redevelopment projects. 
                  Development plans including site grading and drainage plans should be developed to minimize disruption of natural drainage patterns on properties as well as to minimize impacts to downstream drainage infrastructure and structures. Whenever a hydrologic and hydraulic report (as defined in section 8 of the LDM) indicates a potentially adverse impact resulting from development of a property on a downstream property, that project shall incorporate stormwater detention facilities to reduce the discharge rate. The meaning of adverse impact shall apply to situations where the post development discharge rates, up to and including the 100-year storm event, exceed those determined for the pre-developed conditions. Additionally, no increases in stormwater runoff rates shall be allowed at any discharge point from the site unless approved by the county engineer. 
                  The baseline or pre-developed conditions shall be based on an analysis of the existing conditions taking into account existing land use, stormwater management controls and other factors that can affect the hydrologic responsiveness of the site. Proposed developments shall be analyzed for the following storm events: 
                  • 1-year 24-hour Design Storm. 
                  • 2-year 24-hour Design Storm. 
                  • 5-year 24-hour Design Storm. 
                  • 10-year 24-hour Design Storm. 
                  • 25-year 24-hour Design Storm. 
                  • 50-year 24-hour Design Storm. 
                  • 100-year 24-hour Design Storm. 
                  If the total area of the site (i.e. total property area) and the drainage area to each stormwater management facility is less than one acre, then a rainfall intensity based analysis (i.e. rational method) may be performed. However, if detention facilities are to be designed and constructed in series, the 24-hour storm criteria will apply regardless of the drainage area. 
                  Where downstream conditions indicate that the conveyance and/or storage capacity of existing infrastructure could be impacted by the post development conditions, or where existing structures could be impacted by the post developed conditions, a more stringent standard may be required. For example, if the project site drains into an existing detention pond within the study area then the designer will be required to demonstrate that the discharge rates from the proposed development will still allow the detention pond to operate at a level commiserate with the site in an undeveloped state. 
                  Detention facilities should be designed upon the basis of known or projected developments (proposed by the developer) for the contributing drainage basin. Although, the developer is only required to construct the facility with sufficient volume to provide detention for the proposed development, a design shall be provided to the county engineer demonstrating the ultimate configuration of the facility at full build-out. Additionally, the proposed site plan should have sufficient land around the facility reserved to construct the ultimate configuration without significant demolition. 
                  2.2. - Conveyance Systems. 
                  The following subsections outline the specifications for the design of stormwater conveyance systems. In no case, shall a drainage system be designed to directly or indirectly discharge stormwater runoff into a sanitary sewer line or system. 
                  2.2.1. Bridges. 
                  All bridges shall be designed to accommodate the 100-year 24-hour design storm with the established 100-year flood elevation 1-foot below the low cord of the bridge (i.e. the lowest part of the bridge deck structure or girders whichever is lower). 
                  2.2.2. Culverts and pipe systems. 
                  The level of service provided by culverts and pipe systems in Whitfield County, City of Dalton, City of Tunnel Hill and the City of Varnell is dependent on a number of different factors. These include the type of road that the system will service, the potential for upstream flooding, floodplain impacts and other service issues. Generally, the level of service to be provided by culverts is outlined in the table below: 

                   
                  The level of service standards outlined above are considered minimum standards, where warranted the level of service may be increased at the discretion of the designer. For determining the maximum allowable head at any structure, the hydraulic grade line (HGL) should be designed to no less than six inches below the elevation of the inlet (catch basins, yard inlets, drop inlets, hooded grate inlets, etc.). The HGL should be designed to no less than six inches below the rim elevation for all junction boxes. Other inlets such as headwalls, flared end sections, etc. should be designed based on the guidance outlined in section 2.2.4 of the LDM. 
                  Culverts with contributing drainage areas greater than 25 acres shall be designed to the 24-hour storm. For example, if a culvert is to be designed to convey stormwater runoff from a 25-acre drainage basin under a neighborhood road, the design storm shall be a 25-year, 24-hour storm. If a culvert is designed to connect to an existing system of a differing design level of service, then the system with the greater design requirement will be used to size the proposed system. 
                  All pipes should be designed to maintain a minimum velocity of three feet per second during the 2-year design storm to promote sediment removal. 
                  2.2.3. Inlets (catch basins, yard inlets, drop inlets, hooded grate inlets and flumes). 
                  Inlets collecting stormwater runoff from street surfaces and area inlets shall be sized to capture the storm event specified for the pipe system to which it drains and a maximum flooding depth as determined by the following table: 

                   
                  Inlets and grading adjacent to habitable structures shall be designed to prevent stormwater runoff from entering the structure during the 100-year design storm. 
                  In no case shall inlets located on public streets be spaced in excess of the following table: 

                   
                  2.2.4. Inlets (headwalls, flared end sections, etc.). 
                  Inlets that utilize the opening of the pipe as the inlet (i.e. headwalls, flared end sections, etc.) shall be sized to capture the storm event specified for the pipe system to which it drains. The HGL should be designed to be no less than six inches below the edge of pavement or the point at which water would bypass the inlet (i.e. bypass to another inlet, etc.) whichever is less. Additionally, the headwater conditions induced by the inlet should not cause an impact on any upstream drainage structures such that the upstream structure will realize a loss in performance. In simpler terms, the headwater from an inlet should not back water into another culvert or drainage system. This requirement can be waived by the county engineer in situations where it would be infeasible to design the culverts due to proximity of the culverts or extremely shallow grades between the culverts. 
                  2.2.5. Roadside ditches. 
                  Roads constructed without curb and gutter shall incorporate ditches that are designed to the specific design storms. The level of service provided by the ditches shall match the level of service provided by a comparable pipe system as outlined in section 2.2.2 of the LDM above. The level of service standards are considered minimum standards, where warranted the level of service may be increased at the discretion of the designer. 
                  Culverts with contributing drainage areas greater than 25 acres shall be designed to the 24-hour storm. For example, if a culvert is to be designed to convey stormwater runoff from a 25-acre drainage basin under a neighborhood road, the design storm shall be a 25-year, 24-hour storm. 
                  2.2.6. Drainage channels. 
                  For drainage channels designed to convey stormwater runoff either from or to a culvert, the channel should be sized to accommodate the same storm event specified for the pipe system at a minimum. Channels designed to convey stormwater runoff to detention ponds shall be sized to accommodate the 100-year design storm. 
                  2.2.7. Groundwater dewatering. 
                  Sub-drainage will be installed to control the surplus groundwater by intercepting seepage or by lowering or regulating the groundwater level where such conditions exist. 
                  2.2.8. Flood elevation impacts. 
                  It is the policy of Whitfield County, City of Dalton, City of Tunnel Hill and the City of Varnell that raising the elevation of flooding on an adjacent property shall not be acceptable. As such, the level of service standards outlined in section 2.2 of the LDM shall be considered minimum standards. Where flood elevations on an adjacent property will be increased due to development and/or construction of a drainage system, the level of service may be increased by the county engineer to result in no impact to the adjacent property. This requirement may be waived at the county engineer engineer's discretion if the adjacent property owner provides a permanent drainage easement between the two property owners. The easement shall provide that the owner of the impacted property acknowledges that an increase in flood elevations will occur on their property as a result of the proposed development. Additionally, the easement shall include at a minimum a map showing the extent of the pre-development and post-development 100-year floodplains. Finally, the easement must be recorded with the county as an attachment to the affected property's land deed and shall be binding on all future property owners. 
                  2.3. - Stormwater Quality Treatment. 
                  2.3.1. Stormwater quality in new development. 
                  Stormwater management systems for new development shall be designed to treat or retain the runoff from 85 percent of the storms that occur in an average year, and reduce average annual post-development total suspended solids loadings by 80 percent. Averaged from rainfall events across the state of Georgia, this equates to treating storm events of 1.2 inches or less, as well as the first 1.2 inches of runoff for all larger storm events. 
                  The county engineer will waive the water quality treatment requirement if 100 percent of the 1.0-inch runoff reduction volume (RRv) is achieved. If the entire 1.0-inch runoff reduction standard cannot be achieved, the remaining runoff from the 1.2-inch rainfall event must be treated by BMPs to remove at least 80 percent of the calculated average annual post-development TSS loading from the site. 
                  This standard is quantified and expressed in terms of engineering design criteria through specification of the water quality volume (WQV), which is equal to the runoff generated on a site from 1.2 inches of rainfall. The WQV must be treated to the 80 percent TSS removal performance goal. This standard assumes that BMPs will be designed, constructed and maintained according to the criteria in the GSMM. Stormwater discharges from land uses or activities with higher or special potential pollutant loadings may require the use of specific structural practices and pollution prevention practices. A detailed overview of BMPs is provided in chapter 4 of the GSMM. 
                  For further discussion on this standard, see section 2.2.4.1 of the GSMM. 
                  The County encourages the designer to implement specific stormwater credits for reducing the water quality treatment requirements on site. These credits can be found in section 2.3.3 of the GSMM. However, the county recognizes that water quality treatment of stormwater runoff from certain areas of a site is not feasible. As such, the following areas are exempt from water quality treatment. 
                  • Portions of the site that lie within state mandated undisturbed buffers. 
                  • Portions of the site that lie within 50 feet of the property line and drain away from the site assuming that no impervious surfaces (including compacted gravel/rock) lie within the 50 foot zone except retaining walls. 
                  • Impervious surfaces associated with the driveway for the first 50 feet as measured from the edge of pavement of the public street to which it connects. 
                  • Portions of the site which will remain undisturbed and which does not drain to a water quality or detention facility/BMP. These undisturbed areas must contain at least 10,000 square feet of contiguous area. Additionally, these areas must not be used for any purposes during construction and must be protected from such activities by construction fencing or other means to prevent construction personnel ingress. 
                  Additional, water quality requirements may be specified for hotspot land uses and activities. 
                  2.3.2. Stormwater quality in redevelopment. 
                  Stormwater management systems for redevelopment shall be designed to treat or retain the runoff from the disturbed area of the site from 85 percent of the storms that occur in an average year, and reduce average annual post-development total suspended solids loadings by 80 percent. Averaged from rainfall events across the state of Georgia, this equates to treating storm events of 1.2 inches or less, as well as the first 1.2 inches of runoff for all larger storm events. 
                  The county engineer will waive the water quality treatment requirement if 100 percent of the 1.0-inch runoff reduction volume (RRv) is achieved. If the entire 1.0-inch runoff reduction standard cannot be achieved, the remaining runoff from the 1.2-inch rainfall event must be treated by BMPs to remove at least 80 percent of the calculated average annual post-development TSS loading from the site. 
                  This standard is quantified and expressed in terms of engineering design criteria through specification of the water quality volume (WQV), which is equal to the runoff generated on a site from 1.2 inches of rainfall. The WQV must be treated to the 80 percent TSS removal performance goal. This standard assumes that BMPs will be designed, constructed and maintained according to the criteria in the GSMM. Stormwater discharges from land uses or activities with higher or special potential pollutant loadings may require the use of specific structural practices and pollution prevention practices. A detailed overview of BMPs is provided in chapter 4 of the GSMM. 
                  For further discussion on this standard, see section 2.2.4.1 of the GSMM. 
                  The county encourages the designer to implement specific stormwater credits for reducing the water quality treatment requirements on site. These credits can be found in section 2.3.3 of the GSMM. However, the county recognizes that water quality treatment of stormwater runoff from certain areas of a site is not feasible. As such, the following areas are exempt from water quality treatment. 
                  • Portions of the site that lie within 50 feet of the property line and drain away from the site assuming that no impervious surfaces (including compacted gravel/rock) lie within the 50 foot zone except retaining walls. 
                  • Impervious surfaces associated with any new driveway (maximum width of each driveway allowed for exemption is 50 feet) for the first 50 feet as measured from the edge of pavement of the public street to which it connects. 
                  Additional, water quality requirements may be specified for hotspot land uses and activities. 
                  2.3.3. Stormwater quality requirements for hotspot land uses. 
                  Stormwater hotspots are land uses that often produce higher concentrations of certain pollutants, such as hydrocarbons or heavy metals, than are normally found in urban stormwater runoff. For the purposes of stormwater regulation, the following land uses/activities are defined as hotspots: 
                  • Gas/Fueling Stations 
                  • Landfills 
                  • Vehicle Washing/Steam Cleaning 
                  • Auto Recycling Facilities (Stormwater Permitted Sites Only) 
                  • Large Parking Lots with Greater than 200 Car Parking Spaces or 20 Semi-truck parking Spaces 
                  • Outdoor Material Storage Areas 
                  • Loading and Transfer Areas 
                  • Vehicle Maintenance Areas 
                  • Construction Sites 
                  • Industrial Sites (NPDES Industrial) 
                  For the purposes of this regulation, activities that are required to be compliant with National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits issued by the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) will be considered compliant with the water quality requirements of this section if the requirements for the EPD permit are fully met unless noted below. These activities typically include construction site activities and certain industrial activities. Those sites which do not meet these exemption criteria will be required to implement additional requirements. 
                  Gas/fueling stations are required to construct and maintain oil/water separators (or equivalent pre-treatment device approved by county engineer) to collect and treat stormwater runoff from those areas where gas/fuel will be dispensed or loaded to underground and/or above ground storage tanks. 
                  Large parking lots with greater than 200 car parking spaces or 20 semi-truck parking spaces are required to construct and maintain oil/water separators to collect and treat stormwater runoff from those areas where vehicles will be parked. 
                  Vehicle maintenance areas are required to construct and maintain oil/water separators to collect and treat stormwater runoff from those areas where vehicle maintenance will occur and vehicles will be parked awaiting maintenance. 
                  Vehicle washing/steam cleaning areas are required to construct and maintain oil/water/grit separators to collect and treat stormwater runoff from those areas where washing will occur. Sand filters may be utilized in lieu of oil/water/grit separators with prior approval from the county engineer. 
                  Auto recycling facilities are required to construct and maintain oil/water separators to collect and treat stormwater runoff from those areas where vehicles will be stored as well as areas where active recycling is occurring. 
                  Outdoor material storage areas are required to construct and maintain sedimentation basins meeting the minimum standards outlined in the Georgia Manual for Sedimentation and Erosion (current edition) to collect and treat stormwater runoff from those areas where materials will be stored. 
                  Loading and transfer areas other than truck docks which shall be considered exempt will be evaluated on a case by case basis. Generally, where the primary concern will be solids transport to nearby streams and drainage structures, the area will be required to construct and maintain sedimentation basins meeting the minimum standards outlined in the Georgia Manual for Sedimentation and Erosion (the Green Book, current edition). If the primary concern will be hydrocarbons and other floatable contaminants, the area will be required to construct and maintain oil/water separators to collect and treat stormwater runoff. 
                  All oil/water separators should be designed to the following criteria: 
                  • Sized to treat the water quality volume. 
                  • Designed as an off-line system. 
                  • Designed to pre-treat stormwater runoff before entering other water quality BMPs. 
                  2.4. - Channel Protection. 
                  2.4.1. Channel protection for new development projects. 
                  Channel protection shall be provided for each discharge point from the site unless meeting the exemption criteria outlined below. Channel protection shall be accomplished by providing for 24-hour extended detention of the 1-year, 24-hour storm event. 
                  Channel protection shall not be required if one of the following criteria is applicable to an outfall point on the site: 
                  • Point discharges that do not exceed two cubic feet per second for the 1-year, 24-hour storm in a post developed condition. 
                  • Sheet flow discharges that do not have more than 100 feet of contributing drainage area assuming that no impervious surfaces are within the contributing drainage area. 
                  • Point or sheet flow discharges from drainage areas consisting entirely of undisturbed lands on the site. 
                  • Point discharges which drain directly to a piped drainage system and which the county engineer has determined that the outfall of the system will not experience significant channel erosion as a result of not providing channel protection via extended detention of the 1-year, 24-hour storm. 
                  • Point discharges which drain directly to streams, rivers, wetlands, lakes or other scenarios where reduction of the 1-year, 24-hour storm will in the opinion of the county engineer result in no impact to downstream channel integrity. 
                  2.4.2. Channel protection for redevelopment projects. 
                  Channel protection shall be provided for each discharge point from the disturbed portion site unless meeting the exemption criteria outlined below. Channel protection shall be accomplished by providing for 24-hour extended detention of the runoff from the disturbed portion of the site for the 1-year, 24-hour storm event. 
                  Channel protection shall not be required if one of the following criteria is applicable to an outfall point on the site: 
                  • Point discharges that do not exceed two cubic feet per second for the 1-year, 24-hour storm. 
                  • Sheet flow discharges that do not have more than 100 feet of contributing drainage area assuming that no impervious surfaces are within the contributing drainage area. 
                  • Point discharges which drain directly to a piped drainage system and which the county engineer has determined that the outfall of the system will not experience significant channel erosion as a result of not providing channel protection via extended detention of the 1-year, 24-hour storm. 
                  • Point discharges which drain directly to streams, rivers, wetlands, lakes or other scenarios where reduction of the 1-year, 24-hour storm will in the opinion of the county engineer result in no impact to downstream channel integrity. 
                  2.5. - Energy Dissipation. 
                  Energy dissipation shall be employed whenever the velocity of flows leaving a new stormwater facility exceeds the erosion velocity of the downstream area. 
                  3. - APPROVED CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS AND BMPS

Underground detention ponds may be considered on non-residential development projects after the designer has shown that construction of an aboveground detention pond is infeasible to the satisfaction of the county engineer. If allowed, all structures which are designed to store water shall be constructed of reinforced concrete or HDPE. Additionally, the structures should be designed such that vehicular traffic meeting an H-20 loading standard could traverse the area over the detention pond once backfilled or completed without resulting in structural failure of the pond. When designing the pond, the designer should design the structure such that routine maintenance can be accommodated without unreasonable demands being placed on future property owners. 
                  3.2.3. Wet detention ponds. 
                  Wet detention ponds may be constructed if the facilities are designed to the criteria outlined in section 4.25 of the GSMM (Volume 2). However, the designer will be required to submit a water balance simulation as part of the hydrologic and hydraulic report submittal.

                  3.3.1. Proprietary structural controls. 
                  The county engineer may at their discretion allow proprietary structural controls. Prior to specification of such a device, the designer shall consult the county engineer to determine if the control will be acceptable. Sufficient evidence through testing reports must be submitted to the county engineer meeting the water quality requirements of removing at least 80 percent of the calculated average annual post-development TSS loading. 
                  3.4 - Drainage Pipe Easements. 
                  All drainage pipe easements are to be the diameter of the pipe plus the width required for trench and slopes to safely maintain or replace drainage structures at a future date. At minimum this easement must be 20 feet and under no circumstance may the easement be within the influence zone of a structural foundation. Additional building set-backs shall be added to the plan as necessary to ensure that structures are not constructed within the easements. This easement width is to account for the required trench and slopes to safely maintain or replace drainage structures at a future date.

Triangular rational method runoff hydrographs may not be utilized in the design of detention facilities. 
                  4.1.2. SCS method. 
                  In most cases, the soil conservation service (SCS) method must be utilized to size detention ponds with contributing drainage areas greater than one acre and culverts with contributing drainage areas greater than 25 acres. All computations shall be in accordance with section 3.1.5 of the GSMM (Volume 2). Rainfall depths shall be derived from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Atlas14 publication, Volume 9, Version 2, Dalton Station. The following table also provides the rainfall depths for use in Whitfield County engineer:

                  The Conasauga River Special District incorporates all properties discharging directly into the Conasauga River. Those properties that fall within the special district shall not be required to meet the detention requirements outlined in section 2.1 of the LDM. Additionally, extended detention of the 1-year, 24-hour storm as outlined in section 2.4 of the LDM will not be required. All other requirements outlined in this manual will remain applicable to the properties. 
                  Those properties lying adjacent to properties in the special district as defined that are able to secure an agreement that is acceptable to the adjacent property owner and Whitfield County will also be considered to lie in the Conasauga River Special District. The agreement should stipulate that the adjacent property owner (i.e. downstream property owner) is aware that stormwater discharges onto their property will increase as a result of the lack of controls and that flooding may be increased on their property. The agreement should also include a release of liability for resultant damages from increased stormwater discharge rates from the upstream property owner and Whitfield County. 
                  5.2. - Coahulla Creek Special District. 
                  The Coahulla Creek Special District incorporates all properties discharging directly into Coahulla Creek and which lie downstream of the confluence of Coahulla Creek and Mill Creek. Those properties that fall within the special district shall not be required to meet the detention requirements outlined in section 2.1 of the LDM. Additionally, extended detention of the 1-year, 24-hour storm as outlined in section 2.4 of the LDM will not be required. All other requirements outlined in this manual will remain applicable to the properties. 
                  Those properties lying adjacent to properties in the special district as defined above and lying below the confluence of Coahulla Creek and Mill Creek that are able to secure an agreement that is acceptable to the adjacent property owner and the Whitfield County will also be considered to lie in the Coahulla Creek Special District. The agreement should stipulate that the adjacent property owner (i.e. downstream property owner) is aware that stormwater discharges onto their property will increase as a result of the lack of controls and that flooding may be increased on their property. The agreement should also include a release of liability for resultant damages from increased stormwater discharge rates from the upstream property owner and Whitfield County. 
                  6. - REQUIREMENTS FOR WAIVER REQUEST 
                  The county engineer does not intend to waiver from the requirements outlined in this manual.
