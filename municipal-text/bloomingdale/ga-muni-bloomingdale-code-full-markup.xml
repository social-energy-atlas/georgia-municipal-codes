PREFACE
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE
                  This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Bloomingdale, Georgia.

                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1983 Code, as supplemented through 1983, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the mayor and council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1983 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein.

                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code.

                  Chapter and Section Numbering System

                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters.

                  Page Numbering System

                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:
                  CHARTER	CHT:1
                  RELATED LAWS	RL:1
                  CHARTER AND RELATED LAWS COMPARATIVE TABLE	RLCT:1

                  CHARTER INDEX	CHTi:1
                  CODE INDEX	CDi:1


                  Indexes

                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested.

                  Looseleaf Supplements

                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.

                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

                  Acknowledgments

                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Ron K. McLaughlin, Code Attorney, and Sherry Allbritton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.

                  The publisher is most grateful to the staff of the city for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(3)"Homestead" means homestead as defined and qualified in Code Section 48-5-40 of the O.C.G.A. [O.C.G.A. § 48-5-40], with the additional qualification that it shall include only the primary residence and not more than five contiguous acres of land immediately surrounding such residence. (b)Each resident of the City of Bloomingdale is granted an exemption on that person's homestead from all City of Bloomingdale ad valorem taxes for municipal purposes in an amount equal to the amount by which the current year assessed value of that homestead exceeds the base year assessed value of that homestead. This exemption shall not apply to taxes assessed on improvements to the homestead or additional land that is added to the homestead after January 1 of the base year. If any real property is removed from the homestead, the base year assessed value shall be recalculated accordingly. The value of that property in excess of such exempted amount shall remain subject to taxation. (c)A person shall not receive the homestead exemption granted by subsection (b) of this section unless the person or person's agent files an application with the governing authority of the City of Bloomingdale, or the designee thereof, giving such information relative to receiving such exemption as will enable the governing authority of the City of Bloomingdale, or the designee thereof, to make a determination as to whether such owner is entitled to such exemption. (d)The governing authority of the City of Bloomingdale, or the designee thereof, shall provide application forms for the exemption granted by subsection (b) of this section which shall require such information as may be necessary to determine the initial and continuing eligibility of the owner for the exemption. (e)The exemption shall be claimed and returned as provided in Code Section 48-5-50.1 of the O.C.G.A. [O.C.G.A. § 48-4-50.1] The exemption shall be automatically renewed from year to year as long as the owner occupies the residence as a homestead. After a person has filed the proper application as provided in subsection (c) of this section, it shall not be necessary to make application thereafter for any year and the exemption shall continue to be allowed to such person. It shall be the duty of any person granted the homestead exemption under subsection (b) of this section to notify the governing authority of the City of Bloomingdale, or the designee thereof, in the event that person for any reason becomes ineligible for that exemption. (f)The exemption granted by this Act shall not apply to or affect state ad valorem taxes, county ad valorem taxes for county purposes, or school district ad valorem taxes for educational purposes. The homestead exemption granted by subsection (b) of this section shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any other homestead exemption applicable to municipal ad valorem taxes. (g)The exemption granted by subsection (b) of this section shall apply to all taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2001.

                  No such ordinance shall be construed to revive any ordinance or part of an ordinance that has been repealed by a
                  subsequent ordinance which is repealed by this chapter. All such ordinances are hereby recognized as continuing
                  in full force and effect to the same extent as if set out at length in this Code.
                  (Code 1983, § 1-6)
                  Sec. 1-7. - Provisions considered continuations of existing ordinances.
                  The provisions appearing in this Code, so far as they are the same as ordinances adopted prior to this Code and
                  included in such Code, shall be considered as continuations and not as new enactments.
                  Sec. 1-8. - Amendments to Code.

                  numbered in accordance with the numbering system of this Code and printed for inclusion in this Code. In the
                  case of repealed chapters, sections and subsections or any part thereof, by subsequent ordinances, such repealed
                  portions may be excluded from the Code by omission from reprinted pages. The subsequent ordinances as
                  numbered and printed or omitted, in the case of repeal, shall be prima facie evidence of such subsequent
                  ordinances until such time that this Code and subsequent ordinances numbered or omitted are readopted as a new
                  code by the city council.

                  The Code of Bloomingdale, Georgia, is hereby amended by adding a section (or article or chapter) to be
                  numbered ____________, which section reads as follows:…." The new section may then be set out in full as

                  city council during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made by the supplement in the Code.
                  The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where
                  necessary, replace pages that have become obsolete or partially obsolete; and the new pages shall be so prepared
                  that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest
                  ordinance included in the supplement.

                  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code that have been repealed shall be excluded from
                  the Code by their omission from reprinted pages.
                  (c)
                  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person authorized to prepare the
                  supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the
                  supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier
                  may:
                  (1)
                  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions.
                  (2)
                  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the
                  supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles.
                  (3)
                  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to
                  accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers.
                  (4)
                  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division,"
                  etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ to ____________" (inserting section numbers to indicate
                  the sections of the Code that embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code).

                  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of ordinance sections inserted
                  into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material
                  included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

                  deemed to be of a greater value than $500.00 by the mayor shall be sold by receiving bids from the general
                  public. The buyer willing to pay the highest price shall be awarded the right to purchase the property in question
                  provided such purchaser can satisfy the city council that such person is in a position to produce the money, check
                  or similar negotiable instrument only at the discretion of the council. The council may delegate the abovementioned power to the mayor to be exercised in the mayor's sole judgment.

                  Such sale, as described in subsection (a) of this section, shall be advertised for a period of two weeks, once each
                  week. On the 14th day after first being advertised or any day thereafter, the city council shall decide which bid to
                  accept. Such sale may be advertised in any paper of general circulation in the city or such sale may be advertised
                  by placing notice of such sale in any public building in the city. Potential purchasers shall give their bids to the
                  city clerk at the city hall on or before the closing date (the closing date shall be mentioned in the advertisement).
                  Bids presented to the clerk should be in a sealed container. The mayor shall open such bids in the presence of at
                  least one other person. The council may refuse any or all bids in its discretion for good and proper reason.
                  (c)
                  The city's surplus personal property may also be sold at public auction. Notice of such auction shall be given by
                  advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation at least once no less than 15 nor more than 60 days before
                  the day of the auction. When appropriate, an experienced auctioneer should be used to cry the sale and assist in
                  the preparation of the sale. The notice shall contain a general description of the property to be sold, all the terms
                  and conditions of the sale, that a deposit may be required in order to participate in the bidding, that the purchaser
                  must remove within a stated time all surplus property purchased, and that the city retains the right to reject any
                  and all bids.
                  (d)
                  Surplus personal property which has an estimated value of $500.00 or less may be sold in established markets
                  where such personal property is regularly sold in wholesale lots and prices are set by open competition. Surplus
                  personal property may be sold at posted prices as determined by the city clerk, provided that such prices are
                  based on fair market value. Surplus personal property may be traded in only when the city clerk determines that
                  the trade-in value is expected to exceed the value estimated to be obtained through the sale or other disposition
                  of such personal property.
                  (e)
                  Only United States postal money orders, certified checks, cashier's checks, or cash shall be accepted for sales of

                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  21/425
                  City employment shall be considered to be the primary employment of all full-time employees. No employee
                  may engage in outside employment which will interfere with the interests of city service. The standard by which
                  some employment is not acceptable includes, but is not limited to:
                  (1)
                  Illegal activity;
                  (2)
                  Employment that by virtue of association will reflect upon the reputation of the city; and
                  (3)
                  High hazard or fatiguing work which might detract from or reduce city job performance.
                  (b)
                  Prior to beginning any regularly scheduled outside employment, employees will obtain specific written approval
                  from the city clerk or his designee on request forms which indicate the name of the outside employer, the nature
                  of the work, hours of work, address and telephone number where the employee can be reached. Such information
                  will become a part of the employee's official personnel record. Employees are required to obtain approval from
                  the city clerk or designee for any change in a previously approved outside employment request.
                  (c)
                  Any employee accepting or engaging in outside employment under the terms of this rule shall make
                  arrangements with the outside employer to be available to respond immediately to any emergency call of duty
                  whenever the city clerk or his designee shall determine that the employee's services are necessary.
                  (d)
                  Employees sustaining injuries while engaged in outside employment are normally ineligible to receive benefits
                  under the city's workers' compensation program. If an employee sustains an injury while engaged in outside
                  employment, but is performing duties within the scope of his city responsibilities (i.e., a police arrest), he may be
                  eligible for partial city workers' compensation benefits.

                  appointed by the council, and the third appointed by the two above named subject to approval by a majority of
                  the mayor and council. All members shall be residents of the city and shall serve a two-year term. No person
                  shall serve as a member of the ethics committee if the person has, or has had within the preceding one-year
                  period, any interest in any contract, transaction, or official action of the city.
                  (b)
                  Members of the ethics committee shall serve without compensation. The city shall provide public meeting space
                  for the committee as requested. Subject to budgetary procedures and limitations, the city shall provide the ethics

                  complaints, and complaints illegibly or informally drawn, be reduced to a memorandum of complaint in such
                  form as it may prescribe.
                  (b)
                  Upon receipt of a complaint in proper form, the ethics committee shall commence a review to determine whether
                  the complaint is justified, unjustified, or fails to state facts sufficient to invoke the disciplinary jurisdiction of the
                  governing authority. Complaints must be reviewed within 60 days from time of receipt. Reviews not initiated
                  within 60 days shall become null and result in dismissal. Dismissed complaints may not be re-filed for a period
                  of six months. The ethics committee shall be empowered to collect evidence and information concerning any
                  complaint and to add the findings and results of its investigations to the file containing such complaint.
                  (c)
                  The ethics committee as appointed herein shall cause the complaint to be served on the member of the governing
                  authority or city employee charged without unreasonable delay. Service may be by personal service or certified
                  mail, return receipt requested. A hearing shall be held within 90 days after filing of the complaint. The
                  committee shall conduct the hearing in accordance with the procedures and regulations it establishes, but in all
                  circumstances, the hearing shall include the taking of testimony and the cross-examination of witnesses.
                  (d)
                  Upon completion of its investigation of a complaint, the ethics committee shall be empowered to dismiss those
                  complaints which are unjustified, frivolous, patently unfounded or which fail to state facts sufficient to invoke
                  the disciplinary jurisdiction of the governing authority; provided, however, that a rejection of such complaint by
                  the ethics committee shall not deprive the complaining party of any action he might otherwise have at law or in
                  equity against the respondent government servant.
                  (e)
                  The ethics committee shall be empowered to adopt forms for formal complaints, subpoenas, notices, applications
                  for reinstatement and any other written instruments necessary or desirable under its rules.
                  (f)
                  The ethics committee shall report its findings to the mayor and council for such action as the mayor and council
                  deem appropriate.

                  (a)
                  Any member of the governing authority who knowingly violates any provision of the code of ethics provided in
                  this article shall be subject to public reprimand or censure by the mayor and council of the city. A city
                  employee's failure to comply with the provisions of this article may result in disciplinary action. Power to
                  administer a greater punishment shall include power to administer the lesser.

                  Any final decision by the mayor and council pursuant to this code of ethics for governing authority members and
                  employees may be reviewed by the superior court of the county. The review by the superior court shall be limited
                  to an inquiry of whether there was any evidence before the mayor and council which supported the decision of
                  the mayor and council. Provided, however, no action of the mayor and council refusing or failing to take action
                  pursuant to this code of ethics may be reviewed by the superior court.

                  (d)
                  If after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question is unfit

                  applicable codes, is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes, or constitutes an

                  any parties in interest that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order:
                  (1)
                  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable
                  cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time
                  specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full
                  compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so
                  that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or,
                  (2)
                  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full
                  compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation
                  to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the
                  order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property.
                  For the purposes of this article, the court shall make its determination of reasonable cost in relation to the present
                  value of the dwelling, building, or structure without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure
                  is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair alter, or improve a structure may
                  be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be factor in the court's determination. The
                  present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits
                  of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. tit. 41, ch. 39A, qualified
                  building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair,
                  alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with
                  the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction.
                  (e)
                  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the public
                  officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure, to be repaired, altered, improved, to be vacated and
                  closed, or demolished. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling,
                  or structure a placard with the following words:
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with
                  the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  41/425
                  an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or
                  occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful."
                  (f)
                  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials
                  for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged
                  materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper
                  records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made
                  without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and the city are relieved of any and all
                  liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation,
                  defects in such salvaged materials.
                  (g)
                  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by
                  the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration
                  to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was
                  incurred.
                  (1)
                  The lien provided for in this paragraph (g) of Code section 14-123 shall attach to the real property upon the filing
                  of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure or demolition in the office of the clerk of the superior
                  court of Chatham County, Georgia, and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice
                  required under subsection (g) of O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12. The clerk of the superior court shall record and index such
                  certified copy of the order in the deed records of Chatham County, Georgia, and enter the lien on the general
                  execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the
                  lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk
                  of the superior court, the public officer shall forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the
                  county tax commissioner. It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in
                  conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it
                  were a real property ad valorem tax, including specifically O.C.G.A. tit. 48, ch. 4; provided, however, that the
                  limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure
                  shall not apply. The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the city.
                  Thirty days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same
                  amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes.
                  (2)
                  The tax commissioner shall collect and retain an amount equal to the cost of administering a lien authorized by
                  O.C.G.A. § 41-2-7 et seq. unless such costs are waived by resolution of Chatham County. Any such amount
                  collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of
                  administering the lien.
                  (3)
                  The city may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into
                  a contract with the county or municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property of the
                  dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such
                  rehabilitation.

                  Where the abatement action does not commence in the superior court, review of a court order requiring the
                  repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the
                  superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29.
                  (5)

                  optional building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted by ordinance, and conditions creating a public health
                  hazard or general nuisance, and may seek to enforce such citation in courts of competent jurisdiction prior to
                  issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this article.

                  Sec. 14-171. - Purposes.
                  This article is designed and intended to balance the interests of the residents of the city, telecommunications
                  providers, and telecommunications customers in the siting of telecommunications facilities within the city so as
                  to protect the health, safety and integrity of residential neighborhoods and foster, through appropriate zoning and
                  land use controls, a competitive environment for telecommunications carriers that does not unreasonably
                  discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services and shall not prohibit or have
                  the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, and so as to promote the city as a proactive
                  city in the availability of personal wireless telecommunications services. To that end, this article shall:
                  (1)
                  Provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities in the city;
                  (2)
                  Protect the city's built and natural environment by promoting compatible design standards for
                  telecommunications facilities;
                  (3)
                  Minimize adverse visual impacts of telecommunications facilities through careful design, siting, landscape
                  screening and innovated camouflaging techniques;
                  (4)
                  Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower or antennae failure through engineering and careful
                  siting of telecommunications tower structures and antennae;
                  (5)
                  Maximize use of any new and existing telecommunications towers so as to minimize the need to construct new
                  towers and minimize the total number of towers throughout the city;
                  (6)
                  Maximize and encourage use of alternative telecommunication tower structures as a primary option rather than
                  construction of additional single-use towers; and
                  (7)
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  46/425
                  Encourage and promote the location of new telecommunications facilities in areas which are not zoned for
                  residential use.

                  ten feet above the roofline, parapet or top of the structure. Macro telecommunication facilities may exceed the
                  height limitation specified for the zoning district.
                  Micro telecommunications facilities means those facilities which are located on existing buildings, poles or other
                  existing support structures where antennae do not project more than three feet above the top of the structure and
                  there are no more than six antennae per site.
                  Monopole tower means a telecommunications tower consisting of a single pole, constructed without guy wires or
                  ground anchors.
                  Telecommunications facilities means antennae and towers, either individually or together.
                  Tower means a structure, such as a lattice tower, guy tower, or monopole tower, constructed as a freestanding
                  structure or in association with a building, other permanent structure or equipment, on which is located one or
                  more antennae intended for transmitting or receiving analog, digital, microwave, cellular, telephone, personal
                  wireless service or similar forms of electronic communication. The term includes microwave towers, common
                  carrier towers, and cellular telephone towers.

                  Any person who attempts to erect or erects a telecommunications facility covered by this article without having
                  first obtained the necessary building permit, special use permit or variance in the manner provided in this article
                  shall be deemed in violation of this article. Any responsible party or other persons convicted by a court of
                  competent jurisdiction of violating any provision of this article shall be guilty of violating a duly adopted
                  ordinance of the city and shall be punished as provided in section 1-11 of this Code. The court shall have the
                  power and authority to place any person guilty of violation of this article on probation and to suspend or modify
                  any fine or sentences.

                  Sec. 14-176. - Preferred and disfavored location sites.
                  (a)
                  Preferred location sites.
                  (1)
                  Collocation sites. Any existing telecommunications towers currently being used for transmitting or receiving
                  analog, digital, microwave, cellular, telephone, personal wireless service or similar forms of electronic
                  communication shall be a preferred location site regardless of the underlying zoning designation of the site;
                  provided, however, that locations which meet this criteria shall be subject to the design and siting components of
                  this article and collocation sites shall not become an antenna farm or otherwise be deemed by the building
                  inspector or the mayor and council to be visually obtrusive.
                  (2)
                  Publicly-used structures. Publicly-used structures are preferred locations throughout the city because they appear
                  in virtually all neighborhoods, are dispersed throughout the city, and due to their institutional or infrastructure
                  uses are generally similar in appearance to or readily adaptable for telecommunications facilities. Therefore,
                  telecommunications facilities should be less noticeable when placed on publicly-used structures than when
                  placed on commercial or residential structures. Publicly-used structures include, but are not limited to, facilities
                  such as police or fire stations, libraries, community centers, civic centers, courthouses, utility structures, water
                  towers, elevated roadways, bridges, flagpoles, schools, hospitals, clocks or bell towers, light poles and churches.
                  (3)
                  Industrial and commercial structures. Wholly industrial and commercial structures such as warehouses,
                  factories, retail outlets, supermarkets, banks, garages, or service stations shall be preferred locations particularly
                  where existing visual obstruction or clutter on the roof or along a roofline can and will be removed as part of the
                  installation of the telecommunications facility.

                  (4)
                  Mixed use buildings in high density districts. Mixed use buildings (housing above commercial or other
                  nonresidential space) are also preferred location sites.
                  (b)
                  Disfavored location sites. Any single-family residential structure or site or multifamily duplex shall be a
                  disfavored site for the location of telecommunications facilities.

                  (a)
                  General requirements for all telecommunications facilities. The requirements set forth in this section shall
                  govern the location and construction of all telecommunications facilities governed by this article.
                  (1)
                  Building code and safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of telecommunications facilities, the owner
                  of a telecommunications facility shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in
                  applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for such telecommunications facilities, as amended
                  from time to time. Owners of telecommunications facilities shall conduct periodic inspections of such facilities at
                  least once every year to ensure structural integrity. Inspections shall be conducted by a qualified, independent
                  engineer licensed to practice in the state. The results of such inspection shall be provided to the building
                  inspector.
                  (2)
                  Regulatory compliance.
                  a.
                  All telecommunications facilities must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC
                  and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate telecommunications
                  facilities. If such standards and regulations are changed then the owners of the telecommunications facilities
                  governed by this article shall bring such telecommunications facilities into compliance with such revised
                  standards and regulations within the date established by the agency promulgating the standards or regulations.
                  b.
                  Owners of telecommunications facilities shall provide documentation showing that each telecommunications
                  facility is in compliance with all applicable federal and state requirements. Evidence of compliance must be
                  submitted every 12 months.
                  (3)
                  Security. All telecommunications facilities shall be equipped with an appropriate anticlimbing device or other
                  similar protective device to prevent unauthorized access to the telecommunications facility.
                  (4)
                  Lighting. No illumination is permitted on telecommunications facilities unless required by the FCC, FAA or
                  other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction or unless necessary for air traffic safety. If lighting is
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  50/425
                  required or necessary, the building inspector may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the
                  design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views.
                  (5)
                  Advertising. No advertising is permitted on telecommunications facilities. However, a whip antenna may be
                  allowed on any legally permitted permanent billboard or outdoor advertising sign as long as the other
                  requirements of this article are met.
                  (6)
                  Visual impact.
                  a.
                  Telecommunications facilities shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable
                  standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color or painted and/or
                  textured to match the existing structure so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
                  b.
                  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and associated electrical and mechanical
                  equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting
                  structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. Roof-mounted
                  antennas shall be made visually unobtrusive by screening to match existing air conditioning units, stairs, elevator
                  towers or other background.
                  c.
                  Where feasible, telecommunications facilities should be placed directly above, below or incorporated with
                  vertical design elements of a building to help in camouflaging.
                  d.
                  Telecommunications facilities shall not be placed in a direct line of sight with historic or scenic view corridors as
                  designated by the mayor and council or by any state or federal law or agency.
                  e.
                  Any equipment shelter or cabinet that supports telecommunications facilities must be concealed from public
                  view or made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment
                  shelters or cabinets shall be screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent
                  with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained.
                  (7)
                  Landscaping.
                  a.
                  Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the telecommunications facility from adjacent public
                  ways, public property and residential property.
                  b.
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  51/425
                  Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site
                  plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost.
                  c.
                  The building inspector may waive or modify the landscaping requirement where lesser requirements are
                  desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes, for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural
                  or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms or where an antenna is placed on an existing structure. In
                  certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural
                  locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be modified or waived by the
                  building inspector.
                  (8)
                  Maintenance impacts. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to
                  reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector or local street, access for
                  maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector or local street.
                  (9)
                  Principal, accessory and joint uses.
                  a.
                  Accessory structures used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall be allowed but not be used for
                  offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a
                  telecommunications facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the telecommunications facility.
                  b.
                  Telecommunications facilities may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable
                  area.
                  (10)
                  Lot size and setbacks.
                  a.
                  The following setback requirements shall apply to all telecommunications facilities; provided, however, that the
                  building inspector may reduce the standard setback requirements of this section if the goals of this article would
                  be better served thereby.
                  1.
                  Telecommunications towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower from any off-site
                  residential structure.
                  2.
                  Towers, guy wires and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements.
                  3.
                  Telecommunications facilities must be set back from any property line a sufficient distance to protect adjoining
                  property from the potential impact of telecommunications facility failure by being large enough to accommodate
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  52/425
                  such failure on the site, based on the engineer's analysis required in section 14-178
                  b.
                  For antennas attached to the roof or a supporting structure on a rooftop, a 1:1 setback ratio (example: ten-foot
                  high antenna and supporting structure requires ten-foot setback from edge of roof) shall be maintained unless an
                  alternative placement is shown to reduce visual impact.
                  (b)
                  Additional requirements for towers.
                  (1)
                  Site location and development shall preserve the preexisting character of the surrounding buildings and land uses
                  and the zone district as much as possible. Personal wireless telecommunication towers shall be integrated
                  through location and design to blend in with existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical.
                  (2)
                  Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography shall be
                  minimized, unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact of the site to the surrounding area.
                  (3)
                  At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials,
                  colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower and related facilities to the natural setting
                  and built environment.
                  (4)
                  Towers shall not be located any closer than 1,500 feet from an existing tower unless technologically required or
                  visually preferable.
                  (5)
                  When a tower is adjacent to a residential use, it must be set back from the nearest residential lot line a distance of
                  at least equal to its total height.
                  (6)
                  In no case shall a tower be located in the required front yard, back yard or side yard in a residential district.
                  (7)
                  Towers shall not be sited where they will negatively affect historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the
                  mayor and council or any state or federal law or agency or where they will create visual clutter.
                  (8)
                  Towers shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped
                  with an appropriate anticlimbing device or other similar protective device designed to prevent tower access.
                  (9)
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  53/425
                  Upon approval of city council, placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided all
                  setback design and landscape requirements are met as to each tower.
                  (Ord. of 3-1-2001, § 19-6; Ord. of 1-3-2008)

                  1.
                  Street address;
                  2.
                  Assessor's block and lot or other applicable ad valorem tax identification number;
                  3.
                  Zoning district;
                  4.
                  Type of building (commercial, residential, mixed use) and number of stories;
                  5.
                  The number of antennas and base transceiver stations per site and the location and type of antenna installation
                  (stand alone rooftop, building facade, etc.) and location of the base transceiver station installation(s);
                  6.
                  The height from grade to the top of the antenna installation; and

                  b.
                  If the applicant does not know specific future tower and antenna site locations but does know of areas where
                  telecommunications facilities will be needed within the next five years to provide service, the applicant shall list
                  the assessor's blocks contained within the anticipated geographic service area and identify each geographic
                  service area with a number that will correspond to the future telecommunication facility site.
                  (3)
                  Additional information requirements for towers.
                  a.
                  If the proposed site is zoned R-1, R-2, R-3, PUD, O-I, or RA, and there are alternative sites in I-1, I-2, C-1, C-2,
                  or PW, applicants must justify why those alternate sites have not been proposed. The building inspector will
                  review with special care justifications that appeal only to undue expense and/or to undue difficulties in entering
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  56/425
                  into a lease agreement. The building inspector shall carefully weigh such claims, and the evidence presented in
                  favor of them, against a project's negative impacts at the proposed site.
                  b.
                  Applicants must identify all existing towers and all towers for which there are applications currently on file with
                  the building inspector. Applicants must provide evidence of the lack of space on all suitable existing towers to
                  locate the proposed antenna and of the lack of space on existing tower sites to construct a tower for the proposed
                  antenna. If collocation on any such towers would result in less visual impact than the visual impact of the
                  proposed tower, applicants must justify why such collocation is not being proposed. If collocation on any such
                  tower would increase negative visual impact, then the applicant must so state and demonstrate. The building
                  inspector will review with special care justifications that appeal only to undue expense and/or to undue
                  difficulties in entering into a lease agreement. The building inspector shall carefully weigh such claims, and the
                  evidence presented in favor of them, against a project's negative impacts at the proposed site.
                  c.
                  In all zones, applicants must demonstrate that they cannot provide personal wireless communication service
                  without the use of a telecommunications tower.
                  d.
                  The applicant shall quantify the additional tower capacity anticipated, including the approximate number and
                  types of antennae. The applicant shall provide a drawing for each tower showing existing and proposed antennae
                  locations. The applicant shall also describe any limitations on the ability of the tower to accommodate other uses,
                  e.g., radio frequency interference, mass height, frequency or other characteristics. The applicant shall describe
                  the technical options available to overcome those limitations and reasons why the technical options considered
                  were not chosen to be incorporated. The building inspector shall approve those limitations if they cannot be
                  overcome by reasonable technical means.
                  e.
                  The applicant must provide a utilities inventory showing the locations of all water, sewage, drainage and power
                  lines impacting the proposed tower site.
                  (4)
                  Other information requested by the building inspector. The applicant must provide any other information which
                  may be requested by the building inspector to fully evaluate and review the application and the potential impact
                  of a proposed telecommunications facility.
                  (b)
                  Expedited review for building permits only. When a telecommunications facility will be a use as of right pursuant
                  to section 14-175 and requires only a building permit and design review before it may be erected, the building
                  inspector will expedite review of the application and render a decision on the application within ten business
                  days after receipt of a complete application.
                  (c)
                  Special use permits.
                  (1)
                  A request for a special use permit shall be initiated by application to the building inspector. The board of zoning
                  appeals may then issue a special use permit under this section, provided the building inspector shall have
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  57/425
                  determined that all of the requirements of section 14-177 have been satisfied and, further, that the benefits of and
                  need for the proposed tower are greater than any possible depreciating effects and damage to the neighboring
                  properties.
                  (2)
                  In granting a special use permit, the board of zoning appeals may impose additional zoning conditions to the
                  extent determined necessary to buffer or otherwise minimize adverse effects of the proposed tower or antenna on
                  surrounding properties.

                  Sec. 14-179. - Collocation.
                  The applicant and owner under this article shall allow other future personal wireless service companies,
                  including public and quasipublic agencies, using functionally equivalent personal wireless technology to
                  collocate antennae, equipment and facilities on a telecommunications facility unless specific technical constraints
                  prohibit such collocation. The applicant and other personal wireless carriers shall provide a mechanism for the
                  construction and maintenance of shared facilities and infrastructure and shall provide for equitable sharing of
                  cost in accordance with industry standards.

                  Sec. 14-180. - Appeals.
                  Appeals from any decision of the building inspector under this article may be taken by any person aggrieved or
                  any official of the city affected by the decision of the building inspector. Such appeal shall be to city council
                  pursuant to section 1108 of the city's zoning code. Any decision by the building inspector or by city council
                  denying a request to place, construct or modify a telecommunications facility shall be in writing and supported
                  by substantial evidence in a written record.

                  Sec. 14-181. - Nuisances.
                  Telecommunications facilities, including, without limitation, power source, ventilation and cooling, shall not be
                  operated so as to cause the generation of heat that adversely affects a building occupant and shall not be
                  maintained or operated in such a manner as to be a nuisance.
                  (Ord. of 3-1-2001, § 19-10)
                  Sec. 14-182. - Removal of antennae and towers.
                  All telecommunications facilities shall be maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable
                  building and technical codes so as to ensure the structural integrity of such facilities. If, upon inspection by the
                  building inspector, any such telecommunications facility is determined not to comply with the code standards or
                  to constitute a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the facility and the
                  owner of the property if such owner is different, such owners shall have 30 days to bring such facility into
                  compliance. If such telecommunications facility is not brought into compliance within 30 days, the city may
                  provide notice to the owners requiring the telecommunications facility to be removed. If such
                  telecommunications facility is not removed within 30 days of receipt of such notice, the city may remove such
                  facility and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal. Delay by the city in taking action shall not in
                  any way waive the city's right to take action. The city may pursue all legal remedies available to it to ensure that
                  telecommunications facilities not in compliance with the code standards or which constitute a danger to persons
                  or property are brought into compliance or removed. The city may seek to have the telecommunications facility
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  58/425
                  removed regardless of the owner's or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any
                  permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted.
                  (Ord. of 3-1-2001, § 19-11)
                  Sec. 14-183. - Abandoned towers.
                  (a)
                  Any telecommunications facility that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered
                  abandoned, whether or not the owner or operator intends to make use of it or any part of it. The owner of a
                  telecommunications facility and the owner of the property where the facility is located shall be under a duty to
                  remove the abandoned telecommunications facility. If such antenna and/or tower is not removed within 60 days
                  of receipt of notice from the city notifying the owner(s) of such abandonment, the city may remove such tower
                  and/or antenna and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal. The city may pursue all legal
                  remedies available to it to ensure that abandoned telecommunications facilities are removed. Delay by the city in
                  taking action shall not in any way waive the city's right to take action. The city may seek to have the
                  telecommunications facility removed regardless of the owner's or operator's intent to operate the tower or
                  antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted.
                  (b)
                  If the owner of an abandoned tower or antenna wishes to use such abandoned tower or antenna, the owner first
                  must apply for and receive all applicable permits and meet all of the conditions of this article as if such tower or
                  antenna were a new tower or antenna.
                  (Ord. of 3-1-2001, § 19-12)
                  Sec. 14-184. - Preexisting towers, nonconforming uses.
                  (a)
                  All telecommunications facilities operative on March 1, 2001, shall be allowed to continue their present usage as
                  a nonconforming use and shall be treated as a nonconforming use in accordance with article VII of the city's
                  zoning code. Routine maintenance, including replacement with a new tower or antenna of like construction and
                  height, shall be permitted on such existing telecommunications facilities. New construction other than routine
                  maintenance shall comply with the requirements of this article.
                  (b)
                  A telecommunications facility that has received city approval as of March 1, 2001, in the form of either a
                  building permit or special use exception, but has not yet been constructed or placed in operation shall be
                  considered an existing telecommunications facility so long as such approval is current and not expired.
                  (c)
                  Placement of an antenna on a nonconforming structure shall not be considered an expansion of the
                  nonconforming structure.

                  Whenever the mayor and council finds that the application of this article would unreasonably discriminate
                  among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services or prohibit or have the effect of

                  Sec. 14-221. - Definitions.
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in
                  this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
                  Jurisdictional wetland means an area that meets the requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army
                  Corps of Engineers.
                  Jurisdictional wetland determination means an official written statement or map signed by the U.S. Army Corps
                  of Engineers that states whether or not jurisdictional wetlands are present on a site.
                  Wetland delineation means a delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of
                  Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1344, as amended.
                  Wetlands inventory area means wetlands identified on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency West Chatham
                  County ADID Map of Wetlands and Uplands (ADID Map) where available or, for property outside the study
                  area defined on the ADID Map, wetlands identified on the current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National
                  Wetlands Inventory (NWI) map for the county. A wetlands inventory area does not necessarily represent
                  jurisdictional wetlands and cannot serve as a substitute for a jurisdictional wetland determination or a wetland
                  determination.

                  Cross reference— Definitions generally, § 1-2.
                  Sec. 14-222. - Wetlands assessment.
                  Prior to the issuance of a building permit or a demolition permit, the building inspector shall assess whether the
                  proposed activity is of a type that could result in a disturbance of wetlands, and, if so, shall also assess whether
                  the proposed activity is located within a wetland inventory area or within 100 feet of a wetland inventory area.
                  To assess whether the proposed activity is located within a wetland inventory area or within 100 feet of a
                  wetland inventory area, the building inspector shall consult with the current U.S. Environmental Protection
                  Agency county ADID map of wetlands and uplands (ADID map). If the proposed activity is not located within
                  the study area defined on the ADID map, the building inspector shall consult the current U.S. Fish and Wildlife
                  Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) Map for the county.

                  Sec. 14-223. - Issuance of permits.
                  (a)
                  If the building inspector determines that the proposed activity is of a type that could not result in a disturbance of
                  wetlands or if the proposed activity is not located within a wetland inventory area or within 100 feet of a wetland
                  inventory area, the building inspector shall follow normal procedures for issuing a building permit or a
                  demolition permit.

                  If the building inspector determines that the proposed activity is of a type that could result in a disturbance of
                  wetlands and that the proposed activity is located within a wetland inventory area or within 100 feet of a wetland
                  inventory area, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers jurisdictional wetland determination shall be required prior to
                  the issuance of a building permit or a demolition permit.
                  (1)
                  If the U.S. Corps of Engineers determines that Department of the Army permit is required a building permit or a
                  demolition permit shall be issued only following issuance of the Department of the Army permit.
                  (2)
                  If the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determines that the proposed activity would not require a Department of the
                  Army permit, the building inspector shall proceed with normal procedures for issuing a building permit or a
                  demolition permit.

                  Wetlands inventory areas do not necessarily represent jurisdictional wetlands within the county and cannot serve
                  as a substitute for a jurisdictional wetland determination or a wetlands delineation. No permit issued pursuant to
                  these regulations relieves a landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.

                  This article shall not apply if the applicant can provide to the building inspector a valid U.S. Army Corps of
                  Engineers wetland delineation that verifies whether the proposed activity is not located within jurisdictional
                  wetlands, or if the applicant can provide a valid U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit or a letter that authorizes
                  the proposed activity within jurisdictional wetlands. If such evidence of compliance with U.S. Army Corps of
                  Engineers permitting requirements is provided, the building inspector shall follow normal procedures for issuing
                  a building permit or a demolition permit.

                  limits specified in this section, then such person must apply for a franchise in accordance with the provisions of
                  this article, and the use of specifically identified streets pursuant to all previously granted revocable licenses shall
                  thereafter be pursuant to and in accordance with any such franchise that may be granted.

                  provision of telecommunications services or private telecommunications services.
                  (f)
                  A franchise may be granted for all or any defined portion of the city. A revocable license may only be granted for
                  use of specifically identified streets.
                  (g)
                  The grant of franchises and revocable licenses to persons providing telecommunications services by the city shall

                  been designated as a disaster area, for any person located or doing business in the city to overcharge for any

                  The existence of overcharging shall be presumed from a substantial increase in the price at which the goods,
                  materials, services, or housing was offered in the usual course of business immediately prior to the onset of the
                  emergency, but shall not include increases in costs to the supplier directly attributable to higher costs of
                  materials, supplies, and labor costs resulting from the emergency.

                  (a)
                  If the municipal judge at the hearing required by section 34-34 shall determine that a condition does exist as
                  alleged that constitutes a nuisance or a condition which under this Code or the ordinances of the city is required
                  or subject to be demolished, removed or abated, the judge shall issue his order and judgment so finding and shall
                  order the property owner or other responsible person to demolish, remove or abate the condition within a period
                  of time to be fixed by the judge. The order shall provide how the condition is to be abated, including, but not

                  against the property upon which the condition existed, ranking equally with the lien for city taxes.

                  Execution shall issue for such costs as in the case of city taxes, and the procedure for the enforcement of the
                  execution shall thereafter be the same as in the case of city taxes.

                  (a)
                  The building official will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been
                  issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required
                  in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate
                  both primary and secondary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees
                  shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee
                  is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and
                  maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing
                  activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein
                  has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a
                  written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to
                  achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person
                  engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation
                  of this article.
                  (b)
                  The building official shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to
                  carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property,

                  requirements and standards for certification and the procedures for decertification of a local issuing authority.
                  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as
                  local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to,
                  review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance
                  with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the
                  governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not
                  administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement
                  entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or
                  municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 30 days
                  within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the
                  county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 30 days after notification by the division,
                  the division may revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is
                  not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop work order requiring
                  that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided,
                  however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the landdisturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing
                  authority shall issue an immediate stop work order in lieu of a warning;
                  (2)
                  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop
                  work order;
                  (3)
                  All stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary
                  corrective action or mitigation has occurred;

                  111/425
                  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant
                  amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his designee, have been or
                  are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed,
                  installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his
                  designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the
                  necessary correction action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing
                  activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and
                  sediment controls.
                  (c)
                  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has
                  failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice
                  shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which
                  such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within
                  the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be
                  deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 34-202(g).
                  The issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a
                  contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance.
                  (d)
                  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation
                  established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or
                  emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed
                  $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in
                  the city Charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00
                  for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of
                  county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as
                  violations of this article under county ordinances approved under this article shall be authorized to impose
                  penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or
                  failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

                  issuing authority upon finding that the holder is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sediment
                  control plan; or that the holder is in violation of permit conditions; or that the holder is in violation of any
                  ordinance; shall entitle the person submitting the plan or holding the permit to a hearing before the mayor and
                  council within 15 days after receipt by the issuing authority of written notice of appeal.

                  (a)
                  Neither the approval of a plan under the provisions of this article, nor the compliance with provisions of this
                  article shall relieve any person from the responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed
                  by law nor impose any liability upon the issuing authority or district for damage to any person or property.
                  (b)
                  The fact that a land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of
                  another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in
                  this article or the terms of the permit.
                  (c)
                  No provision of this article shall permit any persons to violate the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of
                  1975 (O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq.) or the

                  Sec. 34-202. - Application requirements.
                  (a)
                  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first
                  obtaining a permit from the issuing authority of the city to perform such activity.
                  (b)
                  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the issuing authority and must include the applicant's erosion
                  and sedimentation control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the
                  data specified in section 34-203. Soil erosion and sedimentation control plans shall conform to the provisions of
                  sections 34-232 and 34-233. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by six copies of
                  the applicant's soil erosion and sedimentation control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  113/425
                  that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan or that such a visit was
                  not required in accordance with rules and regulations established by the board.
                  (c)
                  A fee, as set forth in the schedule of fees and charges on file in the office of the city clerk, shall be charged for
                  each application.
                  (d)
                  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided
                  that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and
                  paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity
                  included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to
                  issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of
                  such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is
                  required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division,
                  regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction.
                  (e)
                  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the
                  application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the
                  erosion and sedimentation control plan. A district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt.
                  Failure of a district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the
                  district review shall be forwarded to the issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been
                  approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 34-233(15) and (16) and bonding, if required
                  as per subsection (g) of this section have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the issuing authority
                  and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the issuing authority to conduct such review and
                  approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district.
                  (f)
                  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the erosion and
                  sedimentation act (O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.), within three years prior to the date of filing of the application
                  under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application.
                  (g)
                  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security,
                  cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or
                  fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not
                  comply with this article or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call
                  the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of
                  the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect
                  an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the
                  local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations.

                  (c)
                  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase.
                  (d)
                  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the
                  land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the
                  approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this
                  article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected
                  by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit.

                  Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities. Therefore,
                  plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for
                  application of soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices. The provisions shall be
                  incorporated into the erosion and sedimentation control plans. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures
                  and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of sections 34-232 and 34-233. The application of
                  measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage
                  facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control
                  erosion and sedimentation pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity.

                  Sec. 34-232. - Best management practices.
                  (a)
                  Best management practices as set forth in this section and section 34-233 shall be required for all land-disturbing
                  activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete
                  defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b) of this
                  section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant
                  to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection, the terms "proper
                  design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained
                  in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b).
                  (b)
                  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly
                  designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a
                  local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30 (f),
                  the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of
                  receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm
                  water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The
                  turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director.
                  This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes
                  which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such
                  construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
                  (c)
                  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any landdisturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division
                  pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure
                  occurs.
                  (d)
                  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent
                  monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur.

                  Sec. 34-233. - Conservation and engineering practices.
                  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this article for the purpose of governing
                  land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit;
                  and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize
                  erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices
                  contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the state soil and water
                  conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well
                  as the following:
                  (1)
                  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to
                  minimize erosion;
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  118/425
                  (2)
                  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
                  (3)
                  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion
                  potential;
                  (4)
                  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
                  (5)
                  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
                  (6)
                  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
                  (7)
                  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
                  (8)
                  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable;
                  (9)
                  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins,
                  silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is
                  stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-
                  1 et seq.;
                  (10)
                  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or
                  the sloping of fills;
                  (11)
                  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
                  (12)
                  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect
                  other property owners;
                  (13)
                  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are
                  not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum;

                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  119/425
                  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or
                  control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or
                  preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 34-232(b);
                  (15)
                  Except as provided in subsection (16) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all
                  state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow
                  or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural
                  resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where
                  a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control
                  measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; provided, however, the
                  buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of article 5, chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water
                  Quality Control Act" (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq.), shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the
                  director as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
                  a.
                  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural,
                  undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the
                  final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective
                  vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient
                  quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family
                  residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may
                  thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water
                  quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
                  b.
                  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as
                  measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of
                  disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated
                  into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:
                  (i)
                  Stream crossings for water lines; or
                  (ii)
                  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and
                  (16)
                  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested
                  by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant
                  to article 2 of chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act" (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq.), except
                  where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams
                  classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a
                  25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing
                  for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream
                  landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The
                  director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion
                  control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following
                  requirements shall apply to such buffer:
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  120/425
                  a.
                  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural,
                  undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once
                  the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a
                  protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in
                  sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a singlefamily residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy,
                  may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water
                  quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed;
                  b.
                  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as
                  measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of
                  disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated
                  into the project plans and specifications and are implemented:
                  (i)
                  Stream crossings for water lines; or
                  (ii)
                  Stream crossings for sewer lines.
                  c.
                  Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations,
                  ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in
                  sections 34-232 and 34-233
                  d.
                  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of
                  another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in
                  this article or the terms of the permit.

                  (4)
                  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational,
                  camping, travel, or seasonal use.
                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of
                  construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start
                  means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings,
                  installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the
                  placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land
                  preparation, such as clearing, grading or filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways;
                  nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms;
                  nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as
                  garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: accessory structures are not
                  exempt from any ordinance requirements). For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means
                  the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration
                  affects the external dimensions of the building.
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, or a gas or
                  liquid storage tank.
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the
                  structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure
                  before the damage occurred.
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  124/425
                  Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a
                  building, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the
                  market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of the building should be the appraised
                  value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or in the case of damage, the value of
                  the structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed.
                  For purposes of this definition, the term "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first
                  alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that
                  alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The terms does not, however, include those
                  improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which
                  are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions, which have been preidentified by the code enforcement
                  official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project.
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means the repair, reconstruction,
                  rehabilitation, or improvement of the streets, utilities, and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the
                  streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner
                  otherwise prohibited by this article.

                  (a)
                  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property,
                  health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures
                  for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
                  safety and general welfare.
                  (b)
                  The flood losses cited in this section are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to
                  floods which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the
                  cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.

                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public
                  and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
                  (1)
                  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood
                  damage at the time of initial construction.
                  (2)
                  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved
                  in the accommodation of floodwaters.
                  (3)
                  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage.
                  (4)
                  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may
                  increase flood hazards to other lands.
                  (5)
                  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or
                  which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities.

                  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 38-34, the
                  building inspector shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data
                  available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer the provisions of division 4 of this article.
                  (4)
                  Verify and record the actual elevation, in relation to mean sea level (or highest adjacent grade) of the lowest
                  floor, including the basement, of all new or substantially improved structures, in accordance with section 38-
                  83(a)(2).
                  (5)
                  Verify and record the actual elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which the new or substantially improved
                  structures have been floodproofed, in accordance with section 38-83(a)(2).
                  (6)
                  When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, the building inspector shall obtain certification from a
                  registered professional engineer or architect, in accordance with section 38-103
                  (7)
                  Notify adjacent communities and the state department of natural resources prior to any alteration or relocation of

                  (8)
                  For any altered or relocated watercourse, submit engineering data/analysis within six months to the Federal
                  Emergency Management Agency to ensure accuracy of community flood maps. Ensure flood-carrying capacity
                  of any altered or relocated watercourse is maintained.
                  (9)
                  Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for
                  example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions) the
                  building inspector shall make the necessary interpretation. The person contesting the location of the boundary

                  Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed
                  development.
                  (2)
                  Construction stage. For all new construction and substantial improvements, the permittee shall provide as-built
                  regulatory floor elevation or floodproofing certification immediately after the lowest floor or flood-proofing is
                  completed. The permit holder shall submit to the building inspector an as-built certification of the elevation of
                  the lowest floor or floodproofed elevation (in relation to mean sea level or highest adjacent grade, whichever is
                  applicable). Lowest floor certification relative to mean sea level shall be prepared by or under the direct
                  supervision of a registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same. When floodproofing is

                  130/425
                  The mayor and council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or
                  determination is made by the building inspector in the enforcement or administration of this article.
                  (c)
                  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the mayor and council may appeal such decision to the county superior
                  court.
                  (d)
                  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the
                  proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure
                  and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
                  (e)
                  Variance may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the
                  criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that
                  minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
                  (f)
                  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
                  discharge would result.
                  (g)
                  In reviewing such requests, the mayor and council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and
                  all standards specified in this and other sections of this article.
                  (h)
                  Conditions for variances:
                  (1)
                  A variance shall be issued only when there is:
                  a.
                  A finding of good and sufficient cause;
                  b.
                  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
                  c.
                  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
                  public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or
                  conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
                  (2)
                  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction therefore any deviation from the
                  standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  131/425
                  minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a
                  determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of
                  the building.
                  (3)
                  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the
                  base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance
                  will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest flood
                  elevation.
                  (4)
                  The building inspector shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal
                  emergency management agency upon request.
                  (i)
                  Upon consideration of the factors listed in subsections (a)—(h) of this section, and the purposes of this article,
                  the mayor and council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further
                  the purposes of this article.

                  Sec. 38-108. - Floodways.
                  Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 38-34 are areas designated as floodways. A
                  floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In
                  addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without
                  increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
                  (1)
                  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other
                  development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted, however, provided it is
                  demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering
                  practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base
                  flood discharge. A registered professional engineer shall provide supporting technical data and certification
                  thereof.
                  (2)
                  Only if section 38-101(1) is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvements shall comply with
                  all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division.

                  Sec. 38-109. - Standards for subdivision proposals.
                  (a)
                  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
                  (b)
                  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electric and water systems
                  located and constructed to minimize flood damage.

                  136/425
                  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
                  (d)
                  Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed development, including
                  manufactured home parks and subdivisions, greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less.

                  person placing said items in the right-of-way or easement fails and refuses to remove such erected or deposited
                  items immediately, after such person has been ordered to do so by the governing body or its representative, such
                  person shall be guilty of a violation and shall be punished as provided in section 1-8, and each day a violation
                  continues shall be considered a separate offense.

                  (a)
                  If, after the warning notice pursuant to section 46-37 of a first violation by a juvenile, a parent violates section
                  46-35 (in connection with a second violation by a juvenile), this shall be treated as a first offense by the parent.
                  For the first offense by a parent, the fine shall be $250.00, and for each subsequent offense by a parent the fine
                  shall be increased by an additional $50.00, e.g., $300.00 for the second offense, $350.00 for the third offense.
                  The municipal judge, upon finding a parent guilty, shall sentence the parent to pay this fine and the cost of
                  prosecution.
                  (b)

                  incurred by the city for providing personnel to remain in the company of a juvenile who has been detained as a
                  curfew violator if the parent or guardian does not pick up the juvenile within one hour after receiving notice from
                  the city that the city is detaining the juvenile for a curfew violation. The amount to be paid by the parent or
                  guardian shall be based on the hourly wage of the city employee who is assigned to remain with the juvenile plus
                  the cost of benefits for that employee.
                  (c)
                  The parent or legal guardian having custody of a juvenile subject to this section shall be liable for any fine or
                  condition of restitution or reparation imposed by a court upon a curfew violator, provided that the curfew
                  violator has not paid the fine or made restitution or reparation within the time ordered by the court, and further
                  provided that the parent or legal guardian has been made a party defendant in all enforcement proceedings
                  against the curfew violator and shall be served with all citations, summons, complaints, notices, and other
                  documents required to be served on the curfew violator defendant.
                  (d)
                  Any juvenile who shall violate any of the provisions of this article more than three time shall be reported by the
                  chief of police to the juvenile authorities as a juvenile in need of supervision and the chief of police may proceed
                  to file such charges with the juvenile court as he may deem appropriate.

                  If, after the warning notice pursuant to section 46-37 of a violation of this article, an operator of an establishment
                  violates section 46-36 a second time, this shall be treated as a first offense by the operator. For the first offense by
                  an operator, the fine shall be $250.00, and for each subsequent offense by an operator the fine shall be increased
                  by an additional $50.00, e.g., $250.00 for a second offense, $300.00 for a third offense.

                  (3)
                  When the juvenile is on an errand as directed by his parent until the hour of 12:30 a.m.
                  (4)
                  When a juvenile is exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United States Constitution, such as the
                  free exercise of religion, freedom of speech and the right of assembly, by first delivering to the person designated
                  by the chief of police to receive such information a written communication, signed by the juvenile and
                  countersigned, if practicable, by a parent of the juvenile with their home address and telephone number,
                  specifying when, where and in what manner the juvenile will be in a public place during the hours when this
                  article is applicable to such minor in the exercise of a First Amendment right specified in such communications.
                  (5)
                  In case of reasonable necessity for the juvenile remaining in a public place but only after the juvenile's parent has
                  communicated to the chief of police or the person designated by the chief of police to receive such notifications,
                  the facts establishing the reasonable necessity relating to a specified public place at a designated time for a
                  described purpose including points of origin and destination. A copy of the communication, or of the police
                  record thereof, duly certified by the chief of police to be correct, with an appropriate notation of the time it was
                  received and of the names and addresses of the parent and juvenile, shall be admissible evidence.

                  159/425
                  (6)
                  When a juvenile is on the sidewalk or property where the juvenile resides, or on either side of or across the street
                  from the place where the juvenile resides and the adult owner or resident of that property has given permission
                  for the juvenile to be there.
                  (7)
                  When a juvenile is returning home by a direct route (without any unnecessary detour or stop) from and within
                  one hour of the termination of a school activity or an activity of a religious or other voluntary association, or a
                  place of public entertainment, such as a movie, play or sporting event. If the event is not commercial in nature or
                  does not have a fixed, publicly known time at which it will or does end, the sponsoring organization must
                  register the event with the chief of police (or his assigned representative) at least 24 hours in advance, informing
                  the police department of the time that such event is scheduled to begin, the place at which it shall be held, the
                  time at which it shall end, and the name of the sponsoring organization.
                  (8)
                  When authorized, by special permit from the chief of police carried on the person of the juvenile thus authorized,
                  as follows. When necessary nighttime activities of a juvenile may be inadequately provided for by other
                  provisions of this article, then recourse may be had to the chief of police for a special permit as the
                  circumstances warrant. Upon the findings of reasonable necessity for the use of a public place to the extent
                  warranted by a written application signed by a juvenile and by a parent of the juvenile, if feasible, stating:
                  a.
                  The name, age and address of the juvenile;
                  b.
                  The name, address, and telephone number of a parent thereof;
                  c.
                  The height, weight, sex, color of eyes and hair and other physical characteristics of the juvenile;
                  d.
                  The necessity that requires the juvenile to remain upon a public place during the curfew hours otherwise
                  applicable;
                  e.
                  The public place; and
                  f.
                  The beginning and ending of the period of time involved by date and hour.
                  The chief of police may grant a permit in writing for the juvenile's use of a public place at such hours as in the
                  opinion of the chief of police may reasonably be necessary and consistent with the purposes of this article. In an
                  emergency this may be handled by telephone or other effective communication, with a corresponding record
                  being made contemporaneously, to the chief of police or to the person designated by the chief of police to act on
                  his behalf in an emergency, at the police station.

                  When the juvenile is legally employed and carries a certified card of employment, renewable each calendar
                  month when the current facts so warrant, dated or reissued not more than 45 days previously, signed by the chief
                  of police and briefly identifying the juvenile, the addresses of the juvenile's home and of the juvenile's place of
                  employment, and the juvenile's hours of employment.
                  (10)
                  When the juvenile is, with parental consent, engaged in normal interstate travel through the city or originating or
                  terminating in the city.

                  It shall be unlawful for a parent having legal custody of a juvenile knowingly to permit or by inefficient control
                  to allow the juvenile to remain in any public place in the city under circumstances not constituting an exception
                  to, or otherwise beyond the scope of, this article. The term "knowingly" includes knowledge that a parent should
                  reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a juvenile in that parent's legal custody. This
                  requirement is intended to hold a neglectful or careless parent up to a reasonable community standard of parental
                  responsibility through an objective test. It shall, therefore, be no defense that a parent was completely indifferent
                  to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such juvenile.

                  It shall be unlawful for any operator of an establishment to knowingly permit a juvenile to remain at the
                  establishment under circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope of, this
                  article. The term "knowingly" includes knowledge that an operator should reasonably be expected to have
                  concerning the patrons of the establishment. The standard for "knowingly" shall be applied through an objective
                  test: whether a reasonable person in the operator's position should have known that the patron was a juvenile in
                  violation of this article.

                  (a)
                  If a police officer reasonably believes that a juvenile is in a public place in violation of this article, the officer
                  shall notify the juvenile that he is in violation of this article and shall require the juvenile to provide his name,
                  address and telephone number and how to contact his parent or guardian. In determining the age of the juvenile,
                  and in the absence of convincing evidence, a police officer shall, in the first instance of violation of this article,
                  use his best judgment in determining age.
                  (b)

                  161/425
                  The police officer shall issue the juvenile a written warning that the juvenile is in violation of this article and
                  order the juvenile to go promptly home. The chief of police shall send the parent or guardian of the juvenile
                  written notice of the violation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section.
                  (c)
                  The police officer may deliver to a parent or guardian thereof a juvenile under appropriate circumstances; for
                  example, a juvenile of tender age, near home, whose identity and address may readily be ascertained or are
                  known.
                  (d)
                  Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, when a juvenile has received one previous written warning for
                  violation of this article or a police officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the juvenile has engaged in
                  delinquent conduct, the procedure shall then be to take the juvenile to the police station where a parent or
                  guardian shall immediately be notified to come for the juvenile whereupon the parent or guardian and the
                  juvenile shall be questioned. This is intended to permit ascertainment, under constitutional safeguards, of
                  relevant facts, and to centralize responsibility in the person designated there and then on duty for accurate,
                  effective, fair, impartial and uniform enforcement, and recording, thus, making available experienced personnel
                  and access to information and records.
                  (e)
                  When a parent or guardian, immediately called, has come to take charge of the juvenile, and the appropriate
                  information has been recorded, the juvenile shall be released to the custody of such parent. If the parent cannot
                  be located or fails to take charge of the juvenile, then the juvenile shall be released to the juvenile authorities,
                  except to the extent that in accordance with police regulations, approved in advance by juvenile authorities, the
                  juvenile may temporarily be entrusted to an adult, neighbor or other person who will on behalf of a parent or
                  guardian assume the responsibility of caring for the juvenile pending the availability or arrival of a parent or
                  guardian.
                  (f)
                  In the case of a first violation of this article by a juvenile, a chief of police shall by certified mail send to a parent
                  or guardian written notice of the violation with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in full
                  enforcement of this article, including enforcement of parental responsibility and of applicable penalties.
                  (g)
                  For the first violation of this article by an operator of an establishment who permits a juvenile to remain on the
                  premises, a police officer shall issue a written notice of the violation with a warning that any subsequent
                  violation will result in full enforcement of this article, including enforcement of operator responsibility and of
                  applicable penalties.
                  (h)
                  In any event, the police officer shall, within 24 hours, file a written report with the chief of police or shall
                  participate to the extent of the information for which he is responsible in the preparation of a report on the
                  curfew violation. It is not the intention of this section to require extensive reports that will prevent police officers
                  from performing their primary police duties. The reports shall be as simple as is reasonably possible and may be
                  completed by police departmental personnel other than sworn police officers.

                  Sec. 46-108. - No response to frequent false alarms; appeal of no response determination.
                  (a)
                  When the chief of police determines whether to make an immediate dispatch in response to notification of a
                  signal from a security alarm system, the chief may disregard a call for police assistance when:
                  (1)
                  The call for assistance comes from an alarm system for a premises that has a record of sending more than three
                  false alarms within a calendar year; and
                  (2)
                  The call is the only basis for making the dispatch.
                  (b)
                  The chief of police may consider such a call for assistance as an additional factor in the chief's decision to order
                  an immediate police response when an in-person call, verification from a person at or near the premises, or other
                  independent evidence shows a need for immediate police assistance at the premises.
                  (c)
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  165/425
                  To discourage alarms, the chief of police shall adopt a process of sending a letter or delivering other written
                  notice informing the alarm user who has had a false alarm of the consequences of excessive false alarms, the
                  need to take corrective action, and the prospect that more than three false alarms in a calendar year shall result in
                  the police disregarding alarms from the premises and not responding to requests for immediate police assistance
                  unless there is an in-person call for assistance from someone at or near the premises or other independent
                  information that verifies the need for an immediate police response.
                  (d)
                  Before determining not to respond to alarms from a premises as specified in this section, the chief of police shall
                  send or deliver notice to the alarm user that:
                  (1)
                  More than three false alarms have been received from the premises within a calendar year;
                  (2)
                  The remedy authorized in subsection (a) of this section may be taken;
                  (3)
                  The alarm system user may request a hearing before the chief or the chief's designee and explain why the chief
                  should not take the proposed action;
                  (4)
                  If no hearing is requested, the department will after ten days from the delivery of the notice disregard alarms
                  from the premises unless there is an in-person call for assistance from someone at or near the premises or other
                  independent information that verifies the need for an immediate police response; and
                  (5)
                  A requirement of an in-person communication or other verification shall remain in effect for a period of six
                  months.
                  (e)
                  If a hearing is requested, the chief of police shall schedule the hearing within ten days of the receipt of the
                  request. At the hearing, the chief of police may consider such factors as the steps that the alarm user has taken, or
                  is taking, to correct the problem; the incidents of crime in the area of the premises; the facts and circumstances of
                  the false alarm; and other relevant information presented by the alarm user.
                  (f)
                  The chief of police may suspend or cancel the remedy under subsection (a) of this section if the chief determines
                  that the alarm user has taken appropriate actions to prevent the reoccurrence of false alarms.

                  its business certificate or license has been withheld for nonpayment of the false alarm service fee, will be deemed
                  to be operating without a certificate or license, and will be subject to the penalties resulting therefrom.

                  Sec. 54-105. - Computation of fee.
                  (a)
                  (1)
                  At the option of the developer, the amount of the development impact fee may be determined from the fee
                  schedule established by the city, and maintained in the office of the director and/or city clerk, or as per the
                  provisions of subsection (2) below.
                  (2)
                  If a building permit is requested for a building with mixed uses, the fee shall be determined according to the fee
                  schedule established by the city by apportioning the space committed to uses specified on the fee schedule. If the
                  type of development activity for which a building permit is applied for is not specified on the fee schedule, the
                  director shall use the fee applicable to the most nearly comparable type of land use on the fee schedule. The
                  director shall be guided in the selection of a comparable type by the reports and studies done by the United States
                  Environmental Protection Agency and/or the state, and/or the city department of public works, and/or
                  professional organizations such as the American Society of Civil Engineers.
                  If the director determines the fee by using from the above-named sources and applying the formula set forth in
                  subsection (b) below. In the case of change of use, redevelopment or modification of an existing use which
                  requires the issuance of a building permit, the development impact fee shall be based upon the net increase in the
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  177/425
                  fee for the new use as compared to the previous use. The director shall be guided in this determination by the
                  above-named sources.
                  (b)
                  If a developer elects not to have the development impact fee determined according to subsection (a), above, then
                  the developer may apply for an individual fee determination. A developer applying for an individual fee
                  determination shall prepare and submit to the director an individual fee calculation study for the development
                  activity for which a building permit is sought. The individual fee calculation study shall follow the prescribed
                  methodologies and formats for the study established by the director, or, subject to the prior approval of the
                  director, such other professionally accepted methodology that identifies a project's proportionate share. The
                  developer shall attend a pre-application meeting with the director and no agreement or understanding in regard to
                  data, assumptions or methodology shall be binding upon the city unless provided to the developer in writing. The
                  service demand documentation submitted shall show the basis upon which the individual fee calculation was
                  made, including but not limited to the following:

                  Cost documentation studies including documentation of the cost per unit of impact for construction and
                  documentation credits attributable to the development activity which can be expected to be available to replace
                  the portion of the service volume/demand generated by the development activity.
                  This documentation shall be prepared and presented by qualified professionals in their respective fields and shall
                  follow best professional practices and methodologies. The following formula, as explained in the methodology
                  report, shall be used by the director to determine the development impact fee per unit of development based on
                  the type of land use:
                  [Unit Cost × Demand] - Credit = Proportionate Share
                  Whereby:
                  Unit cost = The average cost per unit of capacity to provide infrastructure or facilities within the service district.
                  Demand = The average volume/capacity or demand expected to be utilized by a given land use on an annual
                  basis.
                  Credit = The average present value of future payments by a land use towards the retirement of debt incurred to
                  construct facilities and infrastructure.
                  The director shall provide the developer with a written individual fee determination within 30 days after
                  presentation of the individual fee calculation study.

                  Upon application to the director, any person engaging in development activity requiring payment of a
                  development impact fee may apply for and shall receive from the director a certification of the application of the
                  development impact fee schedule to a particular development activity proposal or a certification of an individual
                  fee determination for a particular development proposal.
                  (2)
                  Applications for certification shall include the following information items:
                  a.
                  A full and complete description of the project;
                  b.
                  A full and complete description of the proposed land use and the particular proposed development activity;
                  c.
                  A statement as to whether the applicant seeks a certification of the development impact fee schedule as applied to
                  that particular development proposal of a certification of an individual fee determination; and
                  d.
                  If the applicant seeks a certification of an individual fee determination, an individual fee calculation study
                  complying with the requirements of subsection (b) above.
                  (3)
                  The director shall provide an applicant with a written certification of the application of the development impact
                  fee schedule to a particular proposed development activity within five days after the director's receipt of a
                  completed application. The written certification of the director shall establish the development impact fee for a
                  particular proposed development activity for a period of 180 days from the date of certification. The director
                  shall provide the applicant with a written certification of an individual fee determination within 30 days after
                  receipt of a completed application. The individual fee determination certified by the director shall establish the
                  development impact fee for the 180-day period immediately following the date of such certification.
                  Notwithstanding the issuance of any such certification, any changes in or additions to the proposed development
                  activity different from the particular proposed development activity identified in the original application shall be

                  (d)
                  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, prior to engaging in development activity generating
                  demand and impacting city-provided services, and in addition to any other applicable requirements, the
                  developer shall certify in writing to the director:

                  writing to the director the actual land use or uses of the project, and shall present an architect's certificate of the
                  actual gross square footage attributable to each use. In the event that the actual use or uses and/or the actual gross
                  square footage applicable to the actual use or uses differs from that originally certified, and in the event that the
                  development impact fee was previously paid, the developer shall be required to pay the amount of the excess as a
                  condition of final inspection. The amount of the excess shall be based upon the most current development impact
                  fee schedule in effect on the date of final inspection.

                  Any person required to pay a development impact fee pursuant to this article shall pay such fees to the director
                  prior to the issuance of a building permit.
                  (b)
                  All funds collected pursuant to this article shall be identified by the development impact fee district from which
                  it was collected and promptly transferred for deposit into the appropriate development impact fee trust fund to be
                  held in separate accounts as provided in section 54-112. Funds shall be used solely for the purposes specified in
                  this article.

                  services specified in subsection 54-108(2) below. Any such offer must comply with the requirements of section
                  54-108. The portion of the fee represented by the facility and/or infrastructure improvements shall be deemed
                  paid when the construction is completed and accepted by the city for maintenance or when the person claiming
                  such credit posts security for the cost of construction as provided in subsection 54-108(2)e. below. That portion
                  of the fee represented by land dedication shall be deemed paid when the title to such land has been accepted by
                  the city.
                  Notwithstanding subsection (a) above, the city may issue a building permit prior to accepting title to land if the
                  refusal to issue the permit will result in an exceptional hardship to the developer and the city is otherwise
                  reasonably assured that title will be conveyed and accepted within a reasonable time there after. For the purposes
                  of this subsection, an exceptional hardship shall not include a hardship solely created by the developer.

                  (a)
                  Funds collected as development impact fees shall be used for system improvements. No funds shall be used for

                  the amount of development impact fees collected, encumbered, and expended during the preceding year by
                  category of development impact fee districts. Monies, including any accrued interest, not encumbered in any
                  fiscal period shall be retained in the same development impact fee trust fund(s) until the next fiscal period.

                  Credits against development impact fees shall be given as follows:
                  (1)
                  No credit shall be given for project improvements.
                  (2)
                  Credit shall be given for the present value of the construction of improvements or contribution or dedication of
                  land or money by a developer subsequent to July 1, 2008, required or accepted by the city from the developer or
                  his predecessor in title for system improvements.
                  a.
                  A person claiming credits shall submit to the director a project description in sufficient detail to allow the
                  director to prepare an engineering and construction cost estimate. A person proposing credit for improvements
                  shall present cost estimates and property appraisals prepared by qualified professionals to be used by the director
                  in determining the amount of the credit. All construction must be carried out in accordance with applicable city
                  or state development and design standards. A person proposing credits for land dedication shall present the
                  director with property appraisals prepared by qualified professionals and a certified copy of the most recent
                  assessment of the property for tax purposes to be used by the director in determining the amount of credit.
                  However, the director retains the right to determine the amount to be credited by preparing engineering and
                  construction cost estimates and/or property appraisals for those improvements and/or property dedications.

                  Credits must be claimed at the time of the application for a building permit. Any credit not so claimed shall be
                  deemed invalid.
                  c.
                  In the event a developer contracts with the city to construct, fund, or contribute system improvements so that the
                  amount of the credit created by such construction, funding, or contribution is in excess of the development
                  impact fee which would have been otherwise due and owing, the developer shall be reimbursed for such excess
                  construction, funding, or contribution from development impact fees paid by the development projects located in
                  the development impact fee district which has benefitted by such improvements.
                  d.
                  In the event a building permit is abandoned, credit shall be given for the present value of any development
                  impact fees for the same parcel of land paid upon issuance of such building permit. A building permit shall be
                  deemed abandoned if no construction has commenced prior to the expiration of the building permit.
                  e.
                  Security in the form of a performance bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or escrow agreement shall be posted with
                  the city, made payable to the city in the amount approved by the director equal to 110 percent of the full cost of
                  the construction of such facility and/or infrastructure improvements. If facility and/or infrastructure
                  improvements or construction project will not be constructed within one year of the acceptance of the offer by
                  the city, the amount of the security shall be increased by ten percent compounded, for each year of the life of the
                  security. The security shall be renewed and approved by the city attorney's office prior to the acceptance of the
                  security by the city.
                  (3)
                  Credits are transferable from one developer to another and from one project to another provided that such credits
                  may not be transferred to a project in a different development impact fee district.

                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  183/425
                  of the same use, provided that no additional service demands will be produced over and above those produced by

                  proper, and, if so, the extent of such exemption.
                  (c)
                  Exemptions must be applied for at the time of the application for a building permit. Any exemptions not so

                  Upon application to the director by the feepayor, the city shall refund 97 percent of the development impact fee
                  paid if service capacity is available and the building permit is rescinded or in the event development construction

                  (b)

                  paid and not expended or encumbered if the city, if after collecting the fee when service is not available, has
                  failed to encumber the fee or commence construction within six years from the date the development impact fee
                  was paid. The city shall retain three percent of the fee paid as an administrative fee. In determining whether
                  development impact fees have been expended or encumbered, all fees shall be considered encumbered on a firstin, first-out (FIFO) basis.
                  (2)
                  When the right to a refund exists due to the city's failure to encumber development impact fees, the city shall
                  provide written notice of entitlement of a refund to the feepayor who paid the development impact fee at the
                  address shown on the application for development approval, or to a feepayor's successor in interest who has
                  given the city notice of the transfer or assignment of the right or entitlement to a refund and who has provided
                  the city with a mailing address. The city shall publish notice within 30 days after the expiration of the six-year
                  period from the development impact fee payment date. Such published notice shall contain the heading "Notice
                  of Entitlement to Development Impact Fee Refund."
                  (c)
                  A refund application shall be made to the director within one year from the date such refund becomes payable

                  brush, trash, services are furnished, and any other persons as may be liable therefore. The execution shall be a
                  lien upon said premises, and when recorded in the general execution docket of the county shall be a lien upon all
                  the property of the defendant in execution from the date of such record. The execution may be levied by the
                  marshal of the city, and after advertisement and other proceedings as in the case of sale for the nonpayment of
                  taxes, the property levied upon shall be sold at public outcry to the highest bidder. Such sale shall vest an
                  absolute title in the purchaser; provided that the defendant shall have the right to file an affidavit denying that the
                  whole or any part of the amount for which the execution issued is due, and stating what amount such defendant
                  admits to be due, which amounts so admitted to be due shall be paid or collected before the affidavit is received,
                  and the affidavit received for the balance. All affidavits shall set out in detail the reasons the affiant claims the
                  amount is not due, and when received by the city marshal shall be returned to a court of competent jurisdiction,

                  Or, the city may elect to treat the delinquent payment as a debt and may sue to collect such debt. In the case of a
                  water and/or sewer user who is delinquent in the payment of his garbage bill, the city may elect to terminate his
                  water supply.

                  Sec. 70-93. - Transacting business after delinquency.
                  If any person whose duty it is to obtain a registration or occupation tax under this article shall, after such
                  registration or occupation tax becomes delinquent, transact or offer to transact, in the city, any of the kind of
                  profession, trade, or calling subject to this article without having first obtain such registration, such offender
                  shall, upon conviction by the municipal judge, be punished as provided in section 1-11 of this Code.

                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  212/425
                  There is imposed a penalty upon each business which fails to apply for and obtain an appropriate business
                  registration and pay all taxes and fees as provided in this article before April 1 of each year, on the second day of
                  April of each year thereafter. The penalty for failure to comply with this section shall be assessed in the amount
                  of ten percent of the administrative fee and occupational tax determined to be due and owing under the
                  provisions of this article for the first 30 days or fraction thereof of delinquency and an additional two percent of
                  the administrative fee and occupation tax for each additional month or fraction thereof of delinquency. Such
                  penalties shall be in addition to all other penalties, civil and criminal, and may be collected by the remedies
                  provided in this article for collection of the occupation tax, and shall have the same lien and priority as the
                  occupation tax to which the penalty is applied.
                  (Ord. of 12-7-1995, § 5-73(a))
                  Sec. 70-95. - Lien taken for delinquent occupation tax.
                  In addition to the other remedies provided in this division for the collection of the occupation tax levied by this
                  article, the city clerk, upon any tax or installment of such tax becoming delinquent and remaining unpaid, shall
                  issue execution for the correct amount of such tax against the persons, partnership, or corporation liable for such
                  tax, which such execution shall bear interest at the rate of 18 percent per annum from the date when such tax or
                  installment becomes delinquent, and the lien shall cover the property in the city of the person liable for such tax.
                  The lien of such occupation tax shall become fixed on and date from the time when such tax or any installment
                  thereof becomes delinquent. The execution shall be levied by the marshal or other appropriate officer of the city
                  upon the property of the defendant located in such jurisdiction, and sufficient property shall be advertised and
                  sold to pay the amount of such execution, with interest and costs. All other proceedings in relation thereto shall
                  be had as is provided by ordinances and Charter of the city and state law, and the defendant in such execution
                  shall have the rights of defense, by affidavit of illegality and otherwise, which are provided by the applicable
                  laws in regard to tax executions. When a nulla bona entry has been entered by proper authority upon an
                  execution issued by the city clerk against any person defaulting on the occupation tax, the person against whom
                  the entry was made shall not be allowed or entitled to have or collect any fees or charges whatsoever for services
                  rendered after the entry of the nulla bona. If, at any time after the entry of nulla bona has been made, the person
                  against whom the execution issues pays the tax in full together with all interest and costs accrued on the tax, the
                  person may collect any fees and charges due him as though he had never defaulted in the payment of the taxes.
                  (Ord. of 12-7-1995, § 5-86)
                  Sec. 70-96. - Collection by execution.
                  In addition to the other enforcement provisions of this division, the city clerk may proceed to collect any unpaid
                  or delinquent taxes due under this article in the same manner as provided by law for tax executions.
                  (Ord. of 12-7-1995, § 5-67(b))
                  Sec. 70-97. - Revocation of tax registration.
                  Except for a person whose qualification to practice his profession is determined by the general state law, upon
                  the failure of any business to pay the occupation tax or any part of the tax before it becomes delinquent, upon the
                  failure to make any of such returns within the time required in this article, upon failure to make a true return,
                  upon failure to amend a return to set forth the truth, or upon failure to permit inspection of its books as provided
                  in section 70-91, any business tax registration granted by the city under this article permitting the owner of the
                  business to do business for the current year shall be revoked. No new business tax registration shall be granted
                  by the city for the operation of a business for which any part of the occupation tax is at that time unpaid, or to an
                  individual, firm, or corporation who has failed to submit adequate records as requested by the city clerk in
                  accordance with provisions found in section 70-91. In the case of those practitioners where the local government
                  cannot suspend the right of the practitioner to conduct business, the imposition of civil penalties shall be
                  permitted and pursued by the local government in the case of delinquent occupation tax.

                  Sec. 70-98. - Failure to comply with provisions; continuing business after revocation.
                  Any persons, their managers, agents, or employees, who do business in the city after the registration for such
                  business has been revoked, as stated in section 70-97, required to make occupation tax returns, and who fail to
                  make such returns within the time and in the manner provided in this division, who refuse to amend such returns
                  so as to set forth the truth, or who shall make false returns; and any persons, their managers, agents, or
                  employees who refuse to permit an inspection of books in their charge when the officers, agents, employees, or
                  representatives of the city request such inspection, during business hours, for the purpose of determining the
                  accuracy of the returns provided for in this division, shall be subject to penalties provided in this division.

                  (2)
                  If any bill for water service shall be and remain past due and unpaid for as long as 30 days, water service to such
                  delinquent customer shall be disconnected and shall not be reconnected until all past due bills are paid in full,
                  together with a reconnection charge as set forth in the schedule of fees and charges on file in the office of the city
                  clerk.

                  (a)
                  If a consumer of the water service believes his bill for such service to be in error, the consumer shall present a
                  claim, in person, at the city hall before the bill becomes delinquent. Such claim, if made after the bill has become
                  delinquent, shall not be effective in preventing discontinuance of service as heretofore provided. The consumer
                  may pay such bill under protest and such payment shall not prejudice the claim.
                  (b)
                  The city will make a special water meter reading at the request of a consumer for a fee in such amount as set
                  forth in the schedule of fees and charges on file in the office of the city clerk; provided, however, that if such
                  special reading discloses that the meter was overread, no charge will be made.
                  (c)
                  Water meters will be tested at the request of the consumer upon payment to the city of the actual costs of making
                  the test; provided, however, that if the meter is found to overregister beyond three percent of the correct volume,
                  no charge will be made.
                  (d)
                  If the seal of the meter is broken by other than the city's representative or if the meter fails to register correctly or
                  is stopped for any cause, the consumer shall pay an amount estimated from the record of the consumer's previous
                  bills and/or from other proper data.

                  (a)
                  Where a connection is available pursuant to section 78-31, the city shall run a service line from its water main to
                  the property line of the premises to be served. No service charge, other than the connection fee referred to in
                  section 78-33 will be made for a five-eighths-inch meter. Service lines running from the meter to the premises to
                  be served shall be installed by the water customer at said customer's cost.

                  If any meter shall be found to be inoperative at the end of any given billing period or to be faulty or inaccurate
                  for any reason, the meter will be replaced or repaired as soon as possible, and the bill for water used during the
                  current period shall be the average of the last three monthly bills.
                  (c)
                  Water pressure is not guaranteed. The city shall not guarantee an uninterrupted supply of water or water at any
                  particular pressure for any purpose and reserves and shall have the right to shut off the water in its main at any
                  time for the purpose of making repairs or extensions or for other purposes incidental to the public water supply
                  and will not be responsible for any damage caused by low pressure. The city shall have the right to turn off water
                  service at the main for the protection of the city or the user in cases where a private system has been installed or
                  a building has burned or been torn down, or where the consumer has been found to be using water illegally, and
                  to assess the regular schedule of fees for restoration of service. Under normal conditions the consumer will be
                  notified of any anticipated interruptions of service by the city.
                  (d)
                  The cost of the maintenance of city-supplied water meters and the service lines running from the mains to the
                  meters shall be borne by the city, except that repairs will be made at the expense of the consumer/owner when
                  the damage being repaired is due to the negligence on the part of either the consumer/owner, tenant, or employee
                  of the consumer/owner. The cost of such repairs will be billed to and paid by the consumer/owner or the city may
                  cut off the supply of water and water will not be turned on again until the charges are paid to the city.
                  (Code 1983, § 13-27; Ord. of 11-7-1996, §§ 1, 2; Ord. of 5-20-2004, § 1(13-27))

                  Water furnished by the city shall be used for consumption by the consumer, members of the consumer's
                  household and employees of the consumer only. The consumer shall not sell water to any other person or permit
                  any other person to use such water. Water shall not be used for irrigation, fire protection, or other purposes,
                  except when water is available in sufficient quantity without interfering with the regular domestic consumption
                  in the area served. Disregard for this rule shall be sufficient cause for refusal and/or discontinuance of service.
                  (b)
                  Where a meter or meter box is placed on the premises of a consumer, a suitable place shall be provided by the
                  consumer therefor, unobstructed and accessible at all times to the meter reader.
                  (c)
                  The consumer shall furnish and maintain a private cutoff valve on the consumer's side of the meter.
                  (d)
                  If a consumer/owner requests to use a water meter larger than the five-eighths-inch meter which the city
                  furnishes and installs, and such usage is approved by the city's public works department, the consumer/owner
                  shall purchase the meter and install it at its own cost under the city's supervision. The maintenance of such meter,
                  and the cost thereof, shall be borne by the consumer/owner; however, the city may, in case of emergency, repair
                  the meter and, if this is done, the cost of such repair will be billed to and paid by the consumer/owner or the city
                  may cut off the supply of water and water will not be turned on again until the charges are paid to the city.

                  224/425
                  The consumer/owner shall maintain the service lines running from its meter to the premises served. The city
                  may, in case of emergency, repair any service line running from the meter to the premises served and, if this is
                  done, the cost of such repair work will be billed to and paid by the consumer/owner or the city may cut off the
                  supply of water and water will not be turned on again until the charges are paid to the city.
                  (f)
                  All meters shall remain under the direct control of the city and it shall be unlawful for persons other than those
                  authorized by the city to connect, disconnect, or tamper with any such meters. Any consumer/owner purchasing
                  and installing a water meter larger than a five-eighths-inch meter pursuant to subsection (d) of this section shall
                  only perform maintenance work on the meter under the direct supervision of the city's public works department.

                  (a)
                  Duly authorized agents of the city shall have access at all hours to the premises of a water consumer for the
                  purpose of installing or removing city property, inspecting piping, reading and testing meters, or for any other
                  purpose in connection with the water service and its facilities.
                  (b)
                  Extensions to the system shall be made only when the consumer shall grant or convey, or shall cause to be
                  granted or conveyed, to the city a permanent easement of right-of-way across any property traversed by the
                  waterlines.

                  owner or tenant shall immediately notify the public works department of the change in writing. If any new owner
                  or tenant shall fail to give notice or shall fail to apply for service, and if the prior owner or tenant shall have
                  failed to terminate the contract with the city for service, the use of the services of the city's system shall be
                  deemed to be an acceptance by the new owner or tenant of all the contract obligations of the prior owner or
                  tenant to the city and the new owner or tenant shall continue to be subject to all the provisions of this section as
                  fully and completely as if the new owner or tenant had applied for service and the application had been accepted
                  by the city.

                  writing, to the public works department and by paying all amounts due for services up to the date of receipt of
                  the notice by the city; provided that the date of such termination shall not be more than 15 days later than the
                  date of the request. In case the notice is not given, the user shall continue to be liable for service provided
                  thereafter, although such user may vacate the premises or the premises may be occupied by other parties who fail
                  to make application for service. Verbal notices shall not be binding upon the city.

                  225/425
                  If water is desired for any property for which a connection is not available pursuant to section 78-31, the owner
                  or the developer of the property may submit an application, in writing, to the city for permission to lay waterlines
                  from the existing city water system to the property. If the application is granted, a written permit shall be issued
                  to the applicant subject to the following conditions:
                  (1)
                  The permittee shall pay all expenses in connection with the installation of such water main and the connection of
                  same with the water system of the city;
                  (2)
                  All such mains shall be installed in strict accordance with specifications which shall be furnished by the city, and
                  the city shall approve the plans for same before construction shall commence. Fire hydrants, gate valves,
                  manholes and other appurtenances as may be required by the city shall be constructed as a part of the system, at
                  such locations as shall be designated by the city;
                  (3)
                  The city shall have no cost, expense, or liability of any kind whatsoever in connection with the installation of
                  such mains. Any expense incurred by the city in reviewing plans and specifications, making inspections, or
                  otherwise, shall be paid by the permittee upon receipt of statement from the city;
                  (4)
                  When such system shall have been completed by the permittee, the same shall be conveyed to the city, together
                  with a permanent utility easement no less than 20 feet in width, in a form satisfactory to the city, the centerline of
                  which shall be the waterlines; and the city, for so long as it shall continue to furnish water service through such
                  lines, shall maintain them and keep them in good repair. The easement shall provide that the city shall have full
                  access over and upon the same for the purpose of repairing, maintaining, and servicing such waterlines and
                  replacing the same, if necessary, and shall be in perpetuity; provided, however, the city may, at its option, defer
                  the conveyance of the system or systems for as long as it may wish to do so; and
                  (5)
                  The city shall be responsible for the review and preapproval of the design of the water system by checking the
                  size of any proposed water mains, pipes, and lines, and determining both the depth and locations at which they
                  shall be installed by the permittee.

                  (a)
                  Extensions of water mains within the city limits by the city may be accomplished by levying special assessments
                  as permitted by section 4.10 of the city Charter.
                  (b)
                  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, the city may, in its sole discretion, provide water service
                  without resorting to the assessment procedure through special agreement with the parties requesting the
                  extension, or, if the best interest of the city is served, at city expense.

                  discretion, and at city expense when it shall be determined by the city that:
                  (1)
                  The extension is necessary for the orderly growth and development of the city;
                  (2)

                  All new developments served by the city water and sewer system shall install a system of purple pipe for the
                  distribution of reclaimed water to be used for irrigation purposes. The distribution system shall serve all areas of
                  the development and the design of the distribution system must be approved by the city prior to its construction.

                  which contain at least two or more lots, whether classified as a minor subdivision or a major subdivision. This
                  section shall only apply to new developments where water and sewer lines are constructed, developed and/or
                  moved in order to provide water and sewer services to the lots of the subdivision.
                  (c)
                  The passage of the ordinance from which this section derives shall not prohibit the developer, builder, and/or the
                  owner of the development from entering into a reuse water agreement with the city as an alternative means of
                  handling the amount of reclaimed water generated by the development. The agreement shall provide an
                  alternative means of distributing the reclaimed water generated by the development either as a monetary
                  contribution, through the use of reclaimed water as irrigation water on a suitable alternative parcel of land, or any
                  other legal means agreed to by the city.

                  (a)
                  Established. All industrial contributors whose wastewater discharges exceed 200 mg/l BOD and/or 200 mg/l
                  total suspended solids shall be assessed a surcharge in addition to the user charge. The charge shall be based on
                  the proportionally higher BOD and total suspended solids concentration the industry contributes to the
                  wastewater treatment facility in excess of 200 mg/l BOD and TSS.
                  (b)
                  Basis of surcharge. The annual operation and maintenance costs for each year will be allocated as follows:
                  Flow Cost = 50 percent OandM Cost
                  BOD Cost = 40 percent OandM Cost
                  TSS Cost = 10 percent OandM Cost
                  The expected average daily load at the plant for the subsequent year will be determined based on previous
                  experience.
                  (c)
                  Rate of surcharge. The surcharge rate is determined as follows:
                  BOD Surcharge/lb. = BOD OandM Cost
                  365 × BOD lb/day plant
                  TSS Surcharge/lb. = TSS OandM Cost

                  Surcharge = Q × 8.33 [(BODi - 200) × BODR + (TSSi - 200) × TSSR]
                  Where Q = Industry flow in billing period
                  BODi = Industry average BOD in billing period
                  TSSi = Industry average TSS in billing period
                  BODR = BOD Surcharge rate from (c)
                  TSSR = TSS Surcharge rate from (c)

                  254/425
                  (e)
                  Surcharge rate amendment. The surcharge rate will be analyzed annually at the same time as user charges are
                  being reviewed and if adjustment of the rates is justified, new rates will be set by council action.
                  (f)
                  Monitoring. Monitoring of industrial wastewater will be performed by the city at the control manhole.
                  Monitoring will primarily include measurement of flow and analysis of a composite sample for five-day BOD,
                  and for total suspended solids of industrial discharges with concentrations of nonsanitary/domestic flows.
                  (1)
                  When discharge of unusual concentrations of other pollutants (such as phosphorus and nitrogen compounds) or
                  toxic pollutants is possible, the city will periodically have additional analyses performed to determine the
                  concentrations of those pollutants which it is possible for the industry to discharge.
                  (2)
                  Flow will be metered either as the water used by the industry or the wastewater discharged by the industry.
                  Wastewater discharge will be metered only when the industry has provided an effluent flow meter including
                  recorder and totalizer.
                  (3)
                  The frequency of analysis for biochemical oxygen demand and total suspended solids will be based on daily
                  discharge and will be as follows:
                  Industry Flow - gpd Analysis Frequency
                  25,000 to 100,000 Monthly
                  100,000 to 300,000 Semimonthly
                  300,000 to 1,000,000 Weekly
                  Over 1,000,000 Semiweekly

                  (a)
                  Adoption. A rate ordinance based on the user charge system shall be adopted to recover costs for administration,
                  operation and maintenance, debt service and miscellaneous expenses of the sewerage system.
                  (b)
                  Amendments. The rate ordinance shall be reviewed annually and amended, as necessary, to generate adequate
                  revenue to offset all expenses of the sewerage system.
                  (c)

                  Sec. 78-361. - When provided; purpose of standards.
                  (a)
                  Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the mayor and council, they are
                  necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing FOG (fats, oil and grease) or any flammable
                  wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential living
                  quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and
                  inspection. Grease and oil separators shall conform to the city's grease interceptor standards.
                  (b)
                  All interceptors shall be supplied, installed and properly and continuously maintained in a satisfactory and
                  effective operational manner by the owner at his expense.
                  (c)
                  The purpose of this grease trap standard is to provide specific guidelines for grease trap location, design,
                  installation, construction and maintenance in conjunction and compliance with the above requirements. Failure
                  to comply with this division shall be considered violations of applicable section of existing combined sewer use
                  and pretreatment ordinance and consequently will be subject to applicable penalties and/or denial or
                  discontinuance of service as specified in the ordinance.
                  (Ord. of 4-7-2005)
                  Sec. 78-362. - Definitions.
                  The following are in addition to the definitions currently provided in the existing combined sewer use and
                  pretreatment ordinance:
                  Food service establishment means any commercial facility discharging kitchen or food preparation waste waters
                  including restaurants, motels, hotels, cafeterias, hospitals, schools, bars, etc. and any other facility which, in the
                  mayor and council's opinion, would require a grease trap installation by virtue of its operation.
                  Grease interceptor/grease trap means the device which is utilized to effect the separation of grease and oils in
                  water waste effluents from food service establishments. Such traps or interceptors may be of the outdoor or
                  underground type normally referred to as large grease interceptors, or the "under the counter" package units
                  normally referred to as the smaller grease traps. However, for purposes of this division, the words "trap" and
                  "interceptor" are generally used interchangeable. The "under-the-counter" units shall be designed, installed and
                  maintained in accordance to the Plumbing and Drainage Institute Standard PDI-G101.
                  (Ord. of 4-7-2005)
                  Sec. 78-363. - General requirements.
                  The following design, administrative, operational, and other requirements are applicable to all food service
                  establishments, new or existing. Particular requirements for grease trap/interceptor construction, specifically

                  256/425
                  pertaining to both new and existing food service establishments, can be found in section 78-364.
                  (1)
                  All food service establishments shall have grease-handling facilities approved by the city. Establishments whose
                  grease handling facilities are not in accordance with this division shall be given a compliance schedule with a
                  deadline not to exceed six months from initial notification date.
                  (2)
                  All food service establishment grease-handling facilities/operations shall be subject to periodic review,
                  evaluations, and inspection by the city representatives at any time. Results of inspections will be made available
                  to facility owners, with overall ratings assigned and recommendations for correction/improvement (if necessary)
                  delineated.
                  (3)
                  Any facility receiving three consecutive unsatisfactory evaluations shall be subject to penalties/restrictions as
                  provided for in the use and rate resolution for noncompliance with the resolution requirements.
                  (4)
                  Violations of this division will be considered grounds for discontinuance of water and/or sewer service.
                  (5)
                  Food service establishments whose operations cause or allow excessive grease to discharge or accumulate in the
                  sewer collection system are liable to the wastewater quality control department for all costs related to wastewater
                  quality control department service calls for line blockages, line cleaning, line and pump repairs, etc. Including all
                  labor, materials, equipment, and overhead. Failure to pay all service related charges may also be grounds for
                  water/sewer service discontinuance.
                  (6)
                  a.
                  Maintenance contracts and/or records of grease removal frequencies for grease handling facilities may be
                  required at the discretion of the wastewater quality control department to be submitted periodically to ensure
                  routine and adequate system maintenance.
                  b.
                  In the maintaining of the grease interceptors, the owner(s) shall be responsible for the proper removal and
                  disposal by appropriate means of the captured material and shall maintain on site records of the dates, and means
                  of disposal which are subject to review by the wastewater quality control department. Any removal and hauling
                  of the collected materials not performed by owner(s) personnel must be performed by currently licensed waste
                  disposal firms.
                  (7)
                  Any food service establishment whose effluent is suspected or perceived by the wastewater quality control
                  department to contain a concentration of greater than 100 mg/l of oil and grease may be required to routinely
                  sample their grease trap effluent and have it analyzed for oil and greases at the expense of the owner and furnish
                  a copy of the analysis to the wastewater quality control department.

                  (a)
                  New facilities.
                  (1)
                  All newly constructed food service establishments shall be required to install a grease interceptor, approved by
                  the city. Grease interceptor shall be sized at ten gallons per food service seat, with no interceptor less than 1,000
                  gallons total capacity.
                  (2)
                  All grease trap/interceptor plans and specifications must be reviewed and approved by the city prior to
                  installation.
                  (3)
                  The construction and location criteria for grease interceptors shall be in accordance with Environmental
                  Protection Agency (EPA) Guidance Document, "On-Site Wastewater Treatment and Disposal Systems," Chapter
                  8. Typical construction detail drawings for acceptable grease traps are attached to the ordinance from which this
                  division is derived.
                  (4)
                  All grease interceptors, whether singular or in series, must be directly accessible from the surface and must be
                  fitted with an extended outlet sanitary tee that terminates six inches to 12 inches above the tank floor. The
                  minimum access opening dimensions shall be 18 inches × 18 inches.
                  (5)
                  All grease interceptors service fixtures where the total sewage flow exceeds 1500 GPD must either be twochambered or individual tanks in series. If two-chambered, the dividing wall must be equipped with an extended
                  elbow or sanitary tee terminating six inches to 12 inches above the tank floor. An extended outlet sanitary tee
                  must also be provided at the outlet of the second chamber. Both chambers must be directly accessible from the
                  surface. See drawings included in the ordinance from which this division is derived.
                  (6)
                  Above subsections (1)—(5) apply primarily to outdoor type grease trap units.
                  (7)
                  Maintenance of grease traps/interceptors must include thorough pump-out and/or cleaning as needed, with a
                  minimum frequency of four times per year. Maintenance contracts may be required to be submitted to the
                  wastewater quality control department as called for in subsection 78-363(6). The owner, however, is ultimately
                  responsible for the proper maintenance of the grease trap facility(s).

                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  258/425
                  No new food service facility will be allowed to initiate operations until grease handling facilities are installed
                  and approved by the city.
                  (b)
                  Existing facilities.
                  (1)
                  All existing food service establishments shall have grease-handling facilities approved by the city. Food service
                  establishments without any grease handling facilities will be given a compliance deadline not to exceed six
                  months from date of notification to have approved and install grease-handling equipment in compliance with this
                  division. Failure to do so will be considered a violation of the existing combined sewer use and pretreatment
                  ordinance and will subject the establishment to penalties and/or service discontinuance.
                  (2)
                  a.
                  For cases in which "outdoor" type grease interceptors are infeasible to install, existing food service
                  establishments will be required to install adequate and approved "under-the-counter" grease traps for use on
                  individual fixtures, including dishwashers, sinks, and other potentially grease containing drains. In such cases,
                  units will be considered acceptable only if approved flow control fittings are provided to the grease interceptor
                  inlet to prevent overloading of the grease trap and to allow for proper interceptor operation.
                  In such cases as the above, the owner(s) will be notified of the existing system deficiencies and given a
                  compliance deadline not to exceed six months to have approved and installed grease—handling facilities or
                  appurtenances. The mayor and council must give approval of flow control devices and grease trap design prior to
                  installation.
                  b.
                  For cases in which "outdoor" units are feasible to install, construction requirements will be as specified in
                  subsection (a) of this section.
                  (3)
                  In most cases, wastewater from garbage grinders should not be discharged to grease traps/interceptors.
                  (4)
                  In the maintaining of existing grease traps/interceptors, the owner(s) shall be responsible for the proper removal
                  and disposal by appropriate means of the captured material and shall maintain records of the dates and means of
                  disposal which are subject by the water quality control wastewater department.
                  (5)
                  In the event of an existing food service establishments grease handling facilities are either under designed,
                  substandard, or poorly operated, the owner(s) will be notified, in writing, of the required improvements and
                  given a compliance deadline not to exceed six months to conform with these requirements of this division.
                  (6)
                  Exclusive use of enzymes or other grease solvents, emulsifiers, etc. is not considered acceptable grease trap
                  maintenance practice.

                  259/425
                  (7)
                  Grease consuming bacteria may be considered for interim approval for grease trap maintenance, provided
                  approval is obtained for the water quality control wastewater department and providing that this control method
                  is considered effective and satisfactory to the water quality control wastewater inspector. Exclusive use of
                  bacteria may not be sufficient for long term grease trap maintenance, especially for non-biodegradable waste
                  fractions.
                  (c)
                  New food service establishments in existing buildings. New food service establishments locating in existing
                  buildings will be required to comply with the grease trap standards applicable to new facilities, i.e., outdoor type
                  grease trap units (minimum size 1,000 gallons) shall be installed (subsection (a)).

                  Sec. 78-371. - Findings of fact.
                  The following are findings of fact under this article:
                  (1)
                  Uncontrolled stormwater drainage/discharge may have a significant, adverse impact on the health, safety, the
                  welfare of the city, and the quality of life of its citizens. More specifically, surface water runoff can carry
                  pollutants and nutrients into receiving waters.
                  (2)
                  Uncontrolled stormwater drainage can increase the incidence of flooding and the level of floods which occur,
                  endangering roads, other public and private property and human life.
                  (3)
                  Altered land surfaces can change the rate and volume of runoff.
                  (4)
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  260/425
                  Adverse water quality and quantity consequences described in this section could result in substantial economic
                  losses. Potential losses include, but are not limited to, increased water treatment costs, as well as state and federal
                  fines associated with water quality violations.
                  (5)
                  Many future problems can be avoided through proper stormwater management.
                  (6)
                  Every parcel of real property, both public and private, either uses or benefits from the maintenance of the
                  municipal storm sewer system.
                  (7)
                  Current and anticipated growth will contribute to and increase the need for improvement and maintenance of the
                  municipal storm sewer system.
                  (8)
                  Encroachment, such as structures and fill on flood hazard areas, reduces the flood-carrying capacity, increases the
                  flood heights and velocities, and increases flood hazards in areas beyond the encroachment itself.

                  objective will be achieved by providing for regulation and management of a municipal storm sewer system,
                  including public (and private) facilities in the city's service area.
                  (2)
                  Comply with state department of natural resources (DNR) and Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
                  stormwater regulations developed pursuant to the Clean Water Act. These requirements include:
                  a.
                  Control the contribution of pollutants to the municipal storm sewer system by stormwater discharges associated
                  with commercial and industrial activity and the quality of stormwater discharged from sites of commercial and
                  industrial activity;
                  b.
                  Prohibit illicit connections to the municipal storm sewers;

                  a.
                  A narrative that outlines the hydrologic/hydraulic methodology, predeveloped versus postdeveloped runoff
                  conditions, basis of assumptions used in calculations, and a drainage map of the predeveloped and postdeveloped
                  watershed. The narrative should provide cross referencing to attached supportive calculations or comments
                  adjacent to calculations to clarify the intent of the calculation.
                  b.
                  Supportive engineering calculations of the SWMP such as, but not limited to, pipe sizing, time of concentration,
                  peak runoff rates, postdeveloped local peak headwater elevations for the ten-year, 50-year and 100-year storm
                  events, predeveloped and postdeveloped outfall velocities, and detention routing hydrographs.
                  (6)
                  Minimum design requirements for the SWMP shall include the following:
                  a.
                  The postdeveloped peak rate of runoff cannot exceed the predeveloped peak rate of runoff for all storm events
                  from the two-year, 24-hour event up to and including the 50-year, 24-hour storm event.
                  b.

                  267/425
                  The detention facility shall be designed based on the ten-year and 50-year storm event. The principal outlet must
                  convey the design peak flow without emergency overflow. The emergency overflow should be designed to safely
                  handle a 100-year storm. In no case will stormwater stored in roadways or on residential lots be counted toward
                  the required storage volume of the detention facility.
                  c.
                  For hydraulic facilities, other than detention facilities, in drainage areas less than ten acres, the rational method is
                  an acceptable design method. For areas over ten acres, the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service
                  Method or a method approved by the director is required.
                  d.
                  Drainage structures internal to the proposed land development activity will be designed for no less than the tenyear, 24-hour storm event.
                  (7)
                  Record drawings of the stormwater management facilities by a registered professional engineer are required prior
                  to issuance of a certificate for occupancy. Record drawings shall include actual constructed information of the
                  stormwater management facilities such as invert elevations, slopes, facility and pipe locations, dimensions, etc.
                  Modified construction plans are acceptable as record drawings provided changes in the proposed facilities are
                  crossed out and not erased. The registered professional engineer shall state that:
                  a.
                  The facilities have been constructed as shown on the as-built drawings; and
                  b.
                  The facilities as constructed meet the requirements of the accepted SWMP.
                  (8)
                  For development of a project in phases, a stormwater master plan is required to conceptually indicate how the
                  minimum requirements of this article will be met. This does not preclude the requirement of an SWMP for each
                  phase as it is being developed. The master plan of multiphased developments shall consolidate detention
                  facilities to as much as practical.

                  this Code.
                  (b)
                  In addition, any person who does willingly and negligently fail to comply with any provisions of this article shall

                  (1)
                  The director will determine the amount of an assessment against any person or permittee responsible for the
                  violation;
                  (2)
                  Any person against whom an assessment has been issued may secure a review of such assessment by filing with
                  the director written petition setting forth the grounds and reasons for his objections and asking for a hearing in
                  the matter involved;
                  (3)
                  Whenever any assessment has become final because of a person's failure to appeal the director's assessment, the
                  city clerk may apply to the appropriate court for a judgment and seek execution of such judgment and the court,
                  in such proceedings, shall treat a failure to appeal such assessment as a confession of judgment in the amount of
                  the assessment;

                  quantity of the receiving waters;
                  c.
                  Effectiveness of action taken by the violator to cease the violation;
                  d.

                  (2)
                  Impact base flood elevation upstream or downstream;

                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  274/425
                  (302.1) Unless otherwise indicated, the district boundary lines are centerlines of streets or blocks or such lines
                  extended, lot or property lines, corporate limit lines, the centerline of the main tracks of a railroad, a line lying in
                  the center of a stream or drainageway, or the city limits of Bloomingdale.
                  (302.2) Where district boundary lines parallel street rights-of-way or other discernable topographic features, the

                  (302.3) Where a district boundary line divides a lot which is single ownership at the time of this enactment, the
                  use classification of the larger portion may be extended to the remainder without recourse to amendment
                  procedure.
                  (302.4) In case the exact location of a boundary cannot be determined by the foregoing methods, the board of
                  appeals shall, upon application, determine the location of the boundary.
                  (302.5) Where a public road, street, alley, or other right-of-way is officially vacated or abandoned, the
                  regulations applicable to the property to which it is reverted shall apply to such vacated or abandoned road,

                  apply:
                  (303.1) The land areas incorporated shall be classified R-1 one-family residential until such time as such
                  classifications are changed through normal amendment procedures or unless a different classification is called for
                  in the annexation ordinance.
                  (303.2) In all cases, where additions in the total land area require adjustments in the zoning district boundaries,
                  said adjustment shall be made on the official zoning map.

                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  276/425
                  Sec. 409. - Code requirements.
                  All structures shall meet the requirements of all adopted codes in effect including, but not limited to, [the]
                  building code, fire prevention code, and housing code. Where such codes exceed the minimum requirements of
                  this ordinance, the stricter provisions shall apply.
                  Sec. 410. - Site plans required for property contiguous to property with a more restrictive zoning classification or
                  abutting or fronting onto arterial or collector streets.
                  (a)
                  General. Before a building permit is issued for the development of a site which either (1) is contiguous to
                  property with a more restrictive zoning classification or (2) fronts onto or abuts a street classified as an arterial or
                  collector under the provisions of article IX, Code section 900, of Bloomingdale's Subdivision Ordinance, site
                  plans similar to those required for planned unit developments by Code section 1004 of the Zoning Ordinance
                  shall be submitted for review and approval by the planning commission. For purposes of interpreting this Code
                  section, contiguous properties would include properties which do not directly abut each other, but would directly
                  abut each other if not separated by the width of (1) any street or street right-of-way, (2) any creek or river, or (3)
                  any right-of-way of a railroad or other public service corporation. The site plans to be submitted shall show
                  adjacent property, including property lying across any adjacent street; the proposed traffic and pedestrian
                  circulation; the location, type and dimension of buffer areas; the arrangement and types of uses; dedications and
                  reservation of lands, setbacks, permanent open spaces, and protective covenants that apply; hours of operation
                  (where applicable); and such other plan elements, design standards, and controls as may be deemed reasonably
                  necessary by the planning commission to accomplish the purposes of the city's zoning code. The plans shall also
                  include a facade elevation plan which must indicate that the structure to be placed on the site in question will be
                  visually compatible with adjacent or surrounding development in terms of the following:
                  (1)
                  Building orientation and scale.
                  (2)
                  Exterior construction materials, including texture and color.
                  (3)
                  Roof shape, window and door openings, porches and balconies.
                  (4)
                  Fences, landscaping and buffers.
                  (5)
                  Driveway and parking orientation, in keeping with the established character in the area.
                  (6)
                  The architectural style or structure and the facade architectural treatment.
                  (7)
                  Scale, design and location of exterior signs. Special sign restrictions may be required based on the location and
                  character of the development and surrounding area.
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  277/425
                  When such plans have been approved, they shall be certified to the city administrator by the chairman of the
                  planning commission. Building permits shall be issued only for improvements and developments on the site
                  which conform to the approved plans. Until such plans have been so certified, the site shall not be cleared or
                  graded.
                  (b)
                  Exceptions. One- and two-family dwellings shall be exempted from the review procedures of this section;
                  provided that where such development is subject to review under provisions contained elsewhere in the city's
                  Code, such other review provisions shall not be waived.
                  (Ord. of 6-18-1998(3))
                  Sec. 411. - Planned development overlay district (PDOD).
                  (a)
                  Planned development overlay district (PDOD) requirements. Approval for development within a PDOD consists
                  of a two-step process. A general development plan is required for review and approval during the rezoning
                  process to inform the planning commission and city council of the intended development. Following approval of
                  the general development plan, a specific development plan shall be submitted and approved prior to any
                  development, including clearing, grading or subdivision.
                  (1)
                  General development plan required.
                  a.
                  Any petition to create a planned development overlay district submitted hereafter shall be accompanied by a
                  general development plan as set forth herein.
                  b.
                  The general development plan shall include development design(s), total floor area of the primary land uses,
                  residential dwelling unit density, if applicable, land uses, buffers and screening, hours of operation and other
                  items as may be required by the mayor and council. All future development shall be consistent with the approved
                  general development plan.
                  c.
                  Such plans shall promote an environment of stable and desirable character in harmony with the established or
                  proposed land use pattern in surrounding areas.
                  (2)
                  Finding of unusual or extraordinary conditions.
                  a.
                  When the planning commission finds, in conjunction with a petition to rezone any property, that there are
                  unusual or extraordinary conditions, circumstances or concerns which warrant consideration by the mayor and
                  council, the planning commission shall submit the general development plan along with its recommendations to
                  the mayor and council for consideration and approval as part of the rezoning action.
                  b.
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  278/425
                  Where the planning commission finds, in conjunction with a proposal for the creation of a PDOD initiated by the
                  planning commission or the mayor and council, that there are unusual or extraordinary conditions, circumstances
                  or concerns which affect the site in question and which warrant consideration by the mayor and council, the
                  planning commission may recommend design standards and controls for the affected properties which, if
                  approved by the mayor and council, shall be incorporated into any general development plan for the site(s) in
                  question.
                  c.
                  Upon approval of the general plan by the mayor and council, such plan shall constitute the approved land use for
                  the site. Any change in land use which is not consistent with the approved general development plan shall be
                  resubmitted in the same manner as the original general development plan and shall require review and
                  recommendation by the planning commission and review and approval by the mayor and council.
                  d.
                  Any special design standards or special conditions adopted by the mayor and council at the time of rezoning
                  shall become a part of the approved general development plan and shall apply until a subsequent site plan is
                  submitted and approved by the mayor and council in accordance with article XIV, amendments.
                  e.
                  No development shall occur until approval of the specific development plan has been submitted and approved.
                  However, if the applicant can demonstrate that there are unusual or extraordinary conditions, circumstances or
                  concerns which warrant consideration by the mayor and council, the applicant may petition to receive a land
                  disturbance activity (LDA) permit prior to approval of the specific development plan. Such petition shall be
                  reviewed and approved by mayor and council prior to any development activity.
                  (3)
                  Planning commission initiation of PDOD rezoning. The planning commission may, on its own motion,
                  recommend approval of a PDOD. If such recommendation is approved by the mayor and council, the
                  developer(s) shall be required to conform to the requirements as specified herein.
                  (b)
                  General development plan. The general development plan for a proposed PDOD shall show adjacent property,
                  including property lying across any adjacent street, the proposed traffic and pedestrian circulation; the location,
                  type and dimension of buffer areas; the arrangement and types of uses including the square footage (total gross
                  floor area) and acreage of each use(s) (i.e., type retail sales, offices, industrial, warehousing, etc.) and such other
                  plan elements and reasonable design criteria as may be deemed necessary by the planning commission to
                  accomplish the purposes of the zoning program.
                  (1)
                  Standards. Roadway capacity issues, orientation of buildings, buffers and screening, outdoor storage, hours of
                  operations, exterior sound systems, and lighting issues shall be regulated under a PDOD to enhance the purposes
                  and intent of the Bloomingdale zoning program as follows:
                  a.
                  Roadway capacity. When a PDOD abuts an arterial or collector street, the developer of the land in such district
                  shall provide, construct, and install such improvements as the planning commission may recommend and the
                  mayor and council may require, as appropriate, to offset reductions in the traffic capacity of the streets that will
                  be caused by access into and egress from the development within the PDOD. Required improvements may
                  include but not be limited to the installation of a frontage road, installation of street medians to control left
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  279/425
                  turning movements into and out of the development, installation of turning lanes, traffic signal installations, or
                  other traffic flow protective measures.
                  b.
                  Garages and bays. Where any nonresidential structure within this district contains four or more garages or bays,
                  it shall not be oriented towards a single public right-of-way, a residential zoning district, or an existing
                  residential use. However, if the mayor and council, upon a recommendation by the planning commission,
                  determines that such structures are visually compatible with the surrounding land uses after reviewing the
                  development plan in accordance with this section, the garages and bays within such structure shall be allowed to
                  be oriented towards a single public right-of-way but not toward a residential zoning district or any existing
                  residential use unless found to be totally separated and physically screened from the view of any residential
                  property or zoning district allowing residential uses.
                  c.
                  Visual buffer and screening. Visual buffers and screening for any development within a PDOD shall be installed
                  in accordance with the requirements established by the mayor and council, upon a recommendation from the
                  planning commission, to protect the adjoining property values and privacy. However, such buffer and screening
                  element shall not be less than the screening standards of section 404, planted buffer strips, herein.
                  d.
                  Storage. Except where otherwise provided in this zoning ordinance, all storage shall occur within an enclosed
                  building. However, outdoor storage shall not be visible from any adjacent zoning district that does not allow
                  outdoor storage nor from any public right-of-way.
                  e.
                  Hours of operation. Nonresidential activities located adjacent to, across a utility or street right-of-way from, or
                  otherwise in close proximity to residential properties or zoning districts that allow residential uses may be
                  restricted to the hours of operation the use is open for business or for other activities including deliveries. Where
                  it is felt necessary by the mayor and council to protect the character and livability of the residential
                  neighborhoods, such hours may be limited as a condition of the approval of the specific development plan.
                  f.
                  Exterior lighting and noise sources. All exterior lighting or visible lighting fixtures shall be downlit and glare
                  shall be deflected, shaded and focused away from adjacent property and public rights-of-way, but may be of
                  sufficient intensity to discourage vandalism and theft. Any noises or sounds generated on the site may be
                  regulated to protect the character of the adjoining areas. The sound intensity level and/or duration may be
                  restricted by the mayor and council to prevent the sounds from extending across property lines, especially during
                  the evening hours or when the use is adjacent to, or in the vicinity of, noise sensitive land use activities.
                  (c)
                  Specific development plan. Following approval of the general development plan by the mayor and council, no
                  development shall take place until specific development plans (or subdivision plats, where required) shall have
                  been submitted for review and are approved, as follows:
                  (1)
                  Where the general development plan has been approved by the mayor and council, the developer or his successor
                  in title shall submit to the planning commission a plat that meets the requirements of the approved general site
                  plan. The planning commission shall review the specific development plan and make a recommendation to the
                  mayor and council for its action. The plat shall be in compliance with the approved general land use plan for the
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  280/425
                  entire development site, or for the specific phase in question, including all off-site improvements, location and
                  dimensions of buffers and easements, dedications and reservations of lands, setbacks, permanent open spaces,
                  protective covenants that apply, other conditions for development as approved by the mayor and council, and the
                  signature of all owners of land shown on the plat. Upon a finding by the mayor and council that the plat is
                  consistent with the approved general plan, they shall approve the specific plat and shall record (at the expense of
                  the developer or property owner) the plat with the clerk of council and the clerk of the superior court of Chatham
                  County. The property owner/developer shall be provided a copy of the recording data, including a copy of the
                  certified approved specific development plan or plat. No development shall occur which is not shown on the
                  approved specific development plat.
                  (2)
                  Specific development plans shall include a plat of the site showing adjacent property, including property lying
                  across any right-of-way or access way and shall indicate in detail the layout of proposed streets and curb cuts;
                  parking areas; amenities such as open spaces, landscapes and buffer areas; pedestrian and bicycle trails; major
                  drainage ways; school locations; church locations; locations of public facilities; building arrangements;
                  commercial areas; lotting arrangements; and other significant details as may be reasonably recommended by the
                  planning commission and/or required by the mayor and council.
                  (3)
                  Specific development plans or plats shall also identify measures to be taken to preserve the traffic capacity of
                  abutting streets as recommended by the planning commission and/or required by the mayor and council. The
                  construction or installation of such protective measures where required by the mayor and council shall be the
                  responsibility of the developer and may include but not be limited to provisions for frontage roads, construction
                  of street medians to control conflicting turning movements, channelization of traffic, intersection improvements,
                  etc.
                  (4)
                  A facade elevation plan for any proposed structure shall be submitted with the specific development plan or plat.
                  Such structure(s) shall be visually compatible with adjacent or surrounding development in terms of the
                  conditions of section 410 herein.
                  (5)
                  Specific development plans or plats approved by the mayor and council shall be certified by the city clerk and
                  submitted to the building inspector for the issuance of applicable permits. Developments requiring subdivision
                  actions shall be processed in accordance with the provisions of the City of Bloomingdale subdivision
                  regulations. No development shall take place within a PDOD that is not shown on a certified specific
                  development plan or plat without special approval by city council, as described above [in subsection] (a)(2)e.
                  (6)
                  If property within a PDOD zone is to be developed in phases, specific development plans may be submitted in
                  phases.
                  (d)
                  Variances. Development standards shall be applied as provided elsewhere in this chapter for the particular zoning
                  district. All variances approved by the mayor and council as part of a general development plan shall be noted on
                  the specific development plan or plat. Variances from the requirements of this chapter may be approved at the
                  request of the developer on a finding that such variances would:

                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  281/425
                  Be in keeping with the overall character of the area.
                  (2)
                  Would not be contrary to the purpose and intent of this chapter.
                  (3)
                  Would not be detrimental to existing or proposed surrounding uses.
                  (4)
                  Would serve the public purposes to a degree equal to or greater than the standards replaced.
                  (e)
                  Overlay district. When an area is rezoned to a PDOD classification, the letter "P" shall be placed in front of the
                  standard zoning classification identification for the area in question (e.g., an area zoned N-C which is rezoned to
                  a PDOD classification shall be indicated as P-N-C).
                  (f)
                  Tree conservation plan. Within a PDOD, a tree conservation plan shall indicate areas of existing tree cover to be
                  retained and areas proposed for removal. All trees of greater than six inches DBH (diameter at breast height, or
                  four feet above the base of the tree) shall be identified, unless located in a cluster of ten or more trees to be
                  saved, and shown on the specific development plan or plat. All trees in buffer or screening areas shall be
                  maintained on the site unless specifically approved to be removed and so noted on the approved specific
                  development plan or plat. The mayor and council shall approve a tree conservation plan upon a finding that the
                  tree cover proposed to be removed is:
                  (1)
                  Necessary to accomplish the development plan in a logical manner; and/or
                  (2)
                  Required in connection with the execution of the approved development plan and will result in sufficient damage
                  to a specific tree or group of trees, as certified by a registered arborist or landscape architect, to cause its (their)
                  eventual destruction within a short period of time upon the completion of the project. A short period shall be
                  defined herein to be a time lapse of less than five years from the phase of construction impacting the tree(s);
                  (3)
                  Not located in a required buffer area and would not be needed to help screen the proposed site development from
                  adjoining properties.
                  (g)
                  No development activity to occur until specific development plan or plat is approved. No property within a
                  PDOD shall be cleared or subdivided until after a specific development plan or plat has been approved as
                  provided for herein, as described above [in subsection] (a)(2)e. Following approval of a specific development
                  plan, all clearing and subdivision activity shall be consistent with the approved plan.

                  Secs. 412-449. - Reserved.
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  282/425
                  Sec. 450. - Highway 80 Corridor Overlay District.
                  [450.01]
                  Purpose and findings. The purpose of this overlay district is to maintain Bloomingdale's character as the city
                  accommodates new growth. The corridor included in this overlay district serves as a gateway into the city and
                  therefore the appearance and function of this corridor is of vital importance. The intended character of the
                  corridor is articulated so that property owners, the community, and city officials have a common understanding
                  for evaluating proposals as required by this ordinance. The purposes of this ordinance are to:
                  (a)
                  Maintain long-term mobility function, including limiting the number of conflict points;
                  (b)
                  Promote improved pedestrian and vehicular circulation;
                  (c)
                  Encourage designs that create a desirable relationship between individual buildings, circulation systems and
                  adjacent areas;
                  (d)
                  Allow a mixture of complimentary land uses that may include housing, retail, offices, commercial, and civic uses
                  where appropriate;
                  (e)
                  Develop commercial and mixed-use areas that are safe, comfortable and attractive to pedestrians and motorists;
                  (f)
                  Provide roadway, pedestrian, bicycle, and public transit connections to residential areas;
                  (g)
                  Provide transitions and buffers between high traffic streets and residential neighborhoods;
                  (h)
                  Achieve a complementary aesthetic design through high quality architecture and construction with attention to
                  placement, relationship, and orientation of structures to provide greater compatibility with surrounding land uses.
                  (i)
                  Maintain natural beauty and scenic, cultural, and historic character of the Highway 80 corridor, particularly
                  distinctive views, vistas, and visual continuity.
                  [450.02.]
                  Intent. The intended character and vision for Highway 80 is an arterial corridor providing primary east-west
                  access for traveling through the City of Bloomingdale and is an area where commercial development is likely to
                  increase. Incremental development of commercial land uses along a rural or suburbanizing corridor can result in
                  hazardous travel conditions, inefficient use of the transportation network, and loss of community character. As
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  283/425
                  development increases in the Highway 80 corridor, the City of Bloomingdale must consider the cumulative
                  impacts of individual development decisions on the corridor. The vision for Highway 80 is to provide an
                  attractive corridor which supports commercial, office, and mixed-use development. In general, all development
                  shall front Highway 80 and landscaping shall soften the transition from Highway 80 to the development, but not
                  obstruct the visual connection to development. Landscaping at the western gateway should be consistent with the
                  rural and agricultural character of the surrounding area. Access management is a high priority in this corridor. In
                  addition, existing residential development should be respected, especially as it relates to the historic city core
                  between Cherry and Poplar Streets. Non-residential uses in this area are strongly encouraged to maintain the
                  existing scale of the buildings to protect the character of the neighborhood.
                  [450.03.]
                  Definitions.
                  Amenity shall mean pedestrian shelters, gazebos, decorative paving, pathways and sidewalks, landscaping,
                  retention ponds when designed according to the specifications of this ordinance, signage when scaled to the
                  pedestrian and constructed of materials and sizes specified in this ordinance, and other aesthetic features and
                  characteristics approved by the planning commission.
                  Corridor shall mean all lands identified on the City of Bloomingdale's official zoning map.
                  Gateway shall mean an entrance into the city along for all corridors governed by this ordinance.
                  Street tree shall mean a tree selected for its large canopy at maturity, approved by the planning commission.
                  [450.04.]
                  Applicability. This ordinance shall apply to all properties in their entirety abutting U.S. Highway 80 on the north
                  and south side of the roadway with an exhibit map being part of the ordinance showing the overlay district
                  boundaries. The boundaries of the highway corridor overlay districts may be adjusted based upon a natural or
                  manmade feature upon a recommendation by the planning commission and the approval of city council.
                  [450.05.]
                  Permitted uses within the corridor.
                  (a)
                  Uses in the overlay district shall be governed by use restrictions and the dimensional requirements for the
                  underlying zoning district in which the property is located. In addition, uses shall be subject to the specific use
                  provisions of this corridor overlay district, as applicable. In the event of a conflict between the regulations of the
                  underlying district and the corridor overlay district, this Code shall govern.
                  (b)
                  Planned development overlay district (PDOD) requirements do not supersede this overlay ordinance.
                  (c)
                  The inclusion for provisions for uses listed within this corridor overlay district does not guarantee that the use is
                  permitted within the corridor. The applicant shall be responsible for applying for the appropriate zoning as
                  desired.
                  (d)
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  284/425
                  It is anticipated that properties directly adjoining Highway 80 will contain primarily commercial uses, but could
                  also be developed with civic spaces, institutional uses and residences. Mixed uses, including residential use in
                  the same building as commercial, office or other uses, are also encouraged within the corridor. Agriculture,
                  public uses and semi-public uses shall be permitted within the corridor according to the underlying zoning
                  district.
                  [450.06.]
                  Non-Conforming Uses. Nonconforming uses shall comply with Appendix A, Article VII of this ordinance.
                  [450.07.]
                  Access and gateway regulations.
                  (a)
                  Interparcel connections. Linking residential subdivisions and mixed-use developments using interparcel
                  connections and pathways or trails may be required to facilitate vehicle and non-vehicular (pedestrians, cyclists,
                  etc.) movements in the area. Pedestrian paths should be direct and convenient. Interparcel connections between
                  properties in commercial areas shall be provided where feasible to minimize the need for auto traffic movements
                  on the street system.
                  (b)
                  Access driveways. It is the intent of the city to minimize the number of separate commercial driveways, thereby
                  reducing the potential for vehicular crashes and pedestrian injuries. If adjacent lots have direct vehicular access
                  to a side street, the city may require that the access be through a common or joint driveway using interparcel
                  connections between properties. Any access from private properties onto state highways shall be coordinated
                  through the City of Bloomingdale prior to requesting the access connection from the Georgia Department of
                  Transportation.
                  (c)
                  Traffic control. Traffic control features, including signs, pavement markings, etc. shall be prepared in accordance
                  with the guidance of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) published by the Institute of
                  Transportation Engineers (ITE). The developer is responsible for the initial installation of the devices and the
                  maintenance thereof until the public (City of Bloomingdale or other public entity) accepts the street for
                  maintenance.
                  (d)
                  Medians. Roads and entrances to developments connecting with the corridor are encouraged to include center
                  medians for a distance of at least 200 feet from the right-of-way. Medians are desired because they improve
                  traffic safety and can be planted with vegetation to enhance the overall appearance of the corridor, as well as
                  provided refuge for pedestrians.
                  (e)
                  Vehicular access to site. Subdivision of lots within the corridors shall not be allowed if designed so that each lot
                  has its own individual access to the major road and no other access. Each pod of development, or if subdivided,
                  each lot including outparcels, must be connected with on-site access to a frontage road or interconnecting
                  driveway. Single family residences in the overlay district are exempted from this requirement, and are allowed to
                  have individual driveways.
                  (f)
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  285/425
                  Pedestrian access. Pedestrian access shall be provided to individual developments and each establishment within
                  the development. Pedestrians should not have to walk in and along parking aisles, driveways or roadways to get
                  from any one building to another; rather, pedestrian ways shall be well defined, take as direct a path as possible,
                  and they should be separated where practical from automobile access ways. Wherever possible, sidewalks should
                  also be provided so that users can walk between commercial areas and surrounding residential districts in as
                  direct a path as possible.
                  (g)
                  Sidewalks. It is the intent of the City of Bloomingdale to provide a sidewalk network on both sides of all roads
                  within the corridor. Sidewalks on individual properties must connect to any existing sidewalk system within the
                  right-of-way and to adjacent parcels where compatible, as determined by the planning commission. Where no
                  public sidewalk system is provided, sidewalks shall be laid out in such a way that they can be connected in the
                  future to sidewalks on adjoining properties, so as to create a seamless, interconnected network of sidewalks
                  within the corridor.
                  (h)
                  Pedestrian crossings. Where medians are installed, pedestrian access shall be provided across the median as
                  approved by the planning commission. Pedestrian improvements at intersections should be made to ensure that
                  pedestrians can travel safely from one development to another and from one side of the street to another.
                  [450.08.]
                  Parking location and design.
                  (a)
                  Location of parking areas. Buildings should be located at the corner of sites closest to the road intersection, so
                  that the line of sight to parking areas is blocked by buildings and so that the travel path from public sidewalks is
                  shortened. Parking shall be located in a way that it is not visually dominant. Parking is encouraged to be located
                  to the side or rear of buildings. Parking located exclusively between buildings and the road is discouraged.
                  (b)
                  Screening of parking areas. When parking areas are provided in a front yard (in between the road and a principal
                  building), they are encouraged to be visually screened by an evergreen hedge planted between the right-of-way
                  and parking areas to obscure visibility of the parking lot from view from the corridor. While the negative
                  aesthetic impact of parking areas should be lessened, the screen should not obstruct direct visibility of the
                  principal building. Appropriate height, location and type of screening shall be determined by the planning
                  commission.
                  (c)
                  Service and delivery areas. Some commercial buildings may require regular or periodic delivery of goods and
                  services, which is facilitated by a designated service and delivery area separate from parking facilities for
                  customers and other users. Wherever possible, these service and delivery areas, which may consist of parking
                  and loading docks for vans and heavy trucks, should be located at the rear of the building and screened from
                  public view. However, due to lot size and surrounding land uses (such as an adjacent residential district),
                  dedicated service and delivery areas may be deemed by the planning commission to be inappropriate for the
                  property and/or land use.
                  (d)
                  Shared parking. Shared parking is encouraged when multiple uses are located close to one another and their
                  parking demands differ by time of day or day of the week (e.g., church and an indoor theater).

                  286/425
                  (e)
                  Shade trees. Shade trees shall be provided in all parking areas. No greater than ten spaces shall be established
                  without a separation by a canopy tree island no less than 400 square feet in size per tree.
                  [450.09.]
                  Amenity zones within developments.
                  (a)
                  Established. An amenity zone, as defined, is recommended for properties within the corridor overlay district. The
                  amenity zone shall be devoted to aesthetically-pleasing and interest-creating features, such as pedestrian plazas,
                  landscaping, public art, or other approved pedestrian oriented features. Signs that are scaled to the pedestrian are
                  permitted within amenity zones in accordance with the Bloomingdale signage ordinance.
                  (b)
                  Uses and improvements. Pedestrian-oriented outdoor spaces are especially encouraged within amenity zones.
                  Gathering spaces may include formal parks, town greens, small parks/plazas and other places for pedestrian
                  comfort and public interaction. These spaces should be integrated purposefully into the overall design of the
                  development and not merely be residual areas left over after buildings and parking lots are sited. These spaces
                  should also be placed directly adjacent to the areas that generate the users, such as street corners, shops and
                  restaurants, stores, day care centers and dwellings.
                  (c)
                  Street furniture. Within amenity zones, street furniture (e.g., benches, trash receptacles), pedestrian-scale lighting
                  (e.g., street lamps and bollards) and sensitively arranged uses such as outdoor patios should be provided to
                  encourage human interaction and street life. Street furniture, including benches and trash receptacles (waste bins)
                  should be provided wherever necessary. Advertising shall not [be] permitted on street furniture.
                  [450.10.]
                  Landscaping.
                  (a)
                  Amenity zones. Amenity zones shall be landscaped according to a landscape and streetscape plan approved by
                  the planning commission.
                  (b)
                  Gateways. The entrances to the city should provide attractive landscape elements and signage designed to appeal
                  to motorists entering the community. Owners of property adjacent to the city's gateways shall not create a
                  landscaped area or amenity zone that is in conflict with the appearance and character of the gateway signage and
                  plantings.
                  Wherever possible, the landscape elements on private property contiguous to the gateways should be of a nature
                  that is continuous to and supportive of the formal landscape elements on the public right-of-way. Recommended
                  plant materials are native flora and drought-resistant plants.
                  (c)
                  Gateway signage. No gateway signs shall be permitted other than those designated by the City of Bloomingdale.
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  287/425
                  (d)
                  Western gateway. The area surrounding Highway 80 at its western boundary near Effingham County is
                  predominately rural in character, with agricultural lands, forests and wetlands on both sides of the highway. Due
                  to the sensitive nature of the area, commercial development is encouraged to maintain visual buffers that are
                  contextual with their rural surroundings. The developed area surrounding Jimmy Deloach Parkway at the
                  intersection with Highway 80 shall serve as a transition from the rural gateway to the commercial corridor.
                  (e)
                  Medians. Where medians are provided, they shall be landscaped with trees, ground cover, flowers and/or small
                  shrubs that will not interfere with sight visibility of motorists or pedestrians.
                  (f)
                  Street trees. Street trees provide a good contrast to buildings and pavement and help soften the built
                  environment. They enliven streetscapes by blending natural features with built features. Street trees also help
                  buffer pedestrians from vehicles and offer summer shade. Street trees are recommended at no more than 40-foot
                  intervals along the entire property fronting the corridor. Street trees shall be placed outside the right-of-way of
                  Highway 80, if permitted by the city engineer given available visibility considerations.
                  (g)
                  Tree protection. Every effort should be made through the design, layout, and construction of developments
                  within the corridor to incorporate and preserve as many trees as possible.
                  (h)
                  Tree conservation plan. Within the corridor overlay district, a tree conservation plan shall indicate areas of
                  existing tree cover to be retained and areas proposed for removal. All trees of greater than six inches DBH
                  (diameter at breast height, or four feet above the base of the tree) shall be identified, unless located in a cluster of
                  ten or more trees to be saved, and shown on the specific development plan or plat. All trees in buffer or screening
                  areas shall be maintained on the site unless specifically approved to be removed and so noted on the approved
                  specific development plan or plat. The mayor and council shall approve a tree conservation plan upon a finding
                  that the tree cover proposed to be removed is:
                  (1)
                  Necessary to accomplish the development plan in a logical manner; and/or
                  (2)
                  Required in connection with the execution of the approved development plan and will result in sufficient damage
                  to a specific tree or group of trees, as certified by a registered arborist or landscape architect, to cause its (their)
                  eventual destruction within a short period of time upon the completion of the project. A short period shall be
                  defined herein to be a time lapse of less than five years from the phase of construction impacting the tree(s);
                  (3)
                  Not located in a required buffer area and would not be needed to help screen the proposed site development from
                  adjoining properties.
                  (i)
                  Perimeter buffers. When a single-family residence abuts the boundary of a commercial development, a vegetated
                  buffer of at least ten feet in width shall be planted along the entire property line between the non-single family
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  288/425
                  development and a single-family residence. Perimeter buffers may be penetrated by utilities and sidewalks and,
                  if determined appropriate by the planning commission.
                  (j)
                  Corridor buffers. Each development plan shall provide a minimum visual buffer between the right-of-way line of
                  the subject corridor and all proposed structures and parking areas. The buffer setback may leave naturally
                  occurring buffer vegetation intact for its softening effect. This buffer shall be enhanced or created in the absence
                  of naturally occurring vegetation.
                  [450.11.]
                  Provisions for specific uses.
                  (a)
                  Big box retail development. "Big box" development (individual retail establishments with 60,000 square feet or
                  more floor area in one building) are encouraged to be designed with variations in the facade to reduce monotony
                  and create visual interest.
                  (b)
                  Communication towers. Communication towers shall be set back a minimum of twice the tower's height from the
                  right-of-way of Highway 80. See the telecommunications ordinance for further requirements.
                  (c)
                  Fences and walls. Where provided and where visible from the corridor, fences and walls should be composed of
                  brick, stone wood, or other materials as approved by the planning commission. Landscaping should be used to
                  minimize or soften the appearance from the public right-of-way. Chain link fencing shall not be permitted except
                  in side or rear yards and shall be screened with vegetation to a height of six feet. Agricultural land uses are
                  exempted from this requirement.
                  (d)
                  Drive-through facilities. Drive-through facilities are encouraged to be located to the rear or side of the building
                  and shall not abut an amenity zone.

                  (e)
                  Gas station pump islands. Gas station pump islands are encouraged to be located behind or to the side of the
                  principal building and substantially obstructed (except for as may be viewed through approved driveway
                  entrances and exits) from view from the corridor.
                  Courtesy: City of Atlanta, "Quality of Life Development Codes" 2003
                  (f)
                  Stormwater detention facilities. Design of stormwater detention facilities as amenities is encouraged when the
                  facility is located within an amenity zone or landscaped area of the development. Open storm drainage and
                  detention areas visible from the corridor should be incorporated into the design of the development as an
                  attractive amenity. Wet-bottom basins are encouraged. Dry basins, where used, shall be sloped adequately to,
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  290/425
                  ensure proper surface drainage and designed so slopes and bottoms can be easily maintained and extensively
                  landscaped. Bio-retention facilities are also encouraged within parking areas, as an alternative or complement to
                  conventional detention facilities. The vegetation and overall design of a bio-retention facility should enhance the
                  overall appearance of the development.
                  [450.12.]
                  Architecture.
                  (a)
                  Architecture standards generally. The design of structures and their materials and colors should be visually
                  compatible with the overall appearance and character of Bloomingdale.
                  Placement generally. Buildings should be arranged so that they help frame and define the corridor, driveways, or
                  intersecting roads, thus giving deliberate form to streets and sidewalk areas. At least 50 percent of the front
                  building facade of a principal building must orient towards (face) the corridor or an internal street or driveway,
                  so as to effectively frame and define the streetscape and provide convenient pedestrian access along those streets
                  to the buildings.

                  (1)
                  Building walls. Lengthy, featureless facades and building walls lining the corridor should be avoided. Large, flat,
                  blank expenses on a facade are not acceptable and shall not be permitted. Building walls shall not extend more
                  than 200 linear feet parallel to the corridor unless the front facade of the building changes at the building line
                  (i.e., front setback in relation to the corridor) by at least five feet or the front building facade is designed in a way
                  that breaks up the building face into discrete architectural elements. There should be some differentiation
                  between the building base and the top, which can be accomplished with building articulation or details at the roof
                  line. Building articulation can be accomplished through the following:
                  (2)
                  Facade modulation: stepping back or extending forward a portion of the facade;
                  (3)
                  Providing bay windows or repeating window patterns at regular intervals;
                  (4)
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  291/425
                  Providing a porch, patio, deck, covered entry to portions of the facade at the ground level or in the case of two or
                  more story buildings, balconies;
                  (5)
                  Changing the roofline by alternating dormers, or using stepped roofs, gables or other roof elements;
                  (6)
                  Changing materials with the change in building plane.
                  Multiple buildings on the same site should be designed to create a cohesive visual relationship among the
                  buildings. All exterior facades of buildings should employ architectural elements (color, material, design, etc.)
                  which are complementary to one another.
                  (b)
                  Screening of buildings. For buildings which do not front the corridor, the vegetated buffer shall be of adequate
                  depth and plantings to fully screen the sides and/or backs of buildings from view of the right-of-way. In
                  particular, in no instance shall the rear yards or backs of buildings be visible from the corridor.
                  (c)
                  Building materials. Corrugated and/or sheet metal siding and prefabricated steel panels are strongly discouraged
                  on a building. All non-residential building exteriors visible from the corridor are encouraged to be constructed of
                  brick, stone, wood or other materials as approved by the planning commission. The building facade shall be
                  reviewed by the planning commission.
                  (d)
                  Windows. Windows are encouraged to be provided on the facade of all buildings within 100 feet of Highway 80
                  and facing the corridor. A minimum of 25 percent of the ground floor facade area should be composed of nonreflective and transparent windows.
                  (e)
                  Rooftop mechanical equipment. Any mechanical equipment located on the roof of a building should be screened
                  from view from the right-of-way of the corridor by the building roof, a parapet wall or by other screening
                  approved by the planning commission. Such equipment should be as inconspicuous as possible from other
                  viewpoints, as well. In the case of flat roofs, cooling and air handling equipment may be located within a roof
                  depression to comply with this requirement. Where such screening is not feasible in the planning commission's
                  opinion, equipment shall be painted or screened in a manner as to minimize its visibility.
                  (f)
                  Gutters and downspouts. Sheet metal gutters and downspouts should be of a color or painted to a color that is
                  compatible with the other colors on the building facade.
                  (g)
                  Minimum area, bulk regulations and height requirements. Shall be in accordance with the requirements of the
                  underlying zoning district.

                  Existing conditions analysis and site plan required. Any new development within the corridor overlay district
                  shall not be granted any city permits until the site plan of the proposed development has been approved in
                  accordance with Appendix A, § 411 of this Code.

                  [Sec. 601. - Adult entertainment facilities.]
                  (1)
                  Findings; public purpose. Based on the experiences of other urban counties and municipalities, which
                  experiences are relevant to the problems faced by Bloomingdale, Georgia, we take note of the notorious and selfevident conditions attended to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality; which do not vary greatly among
                  generally comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the finding of the mayor and council that
                  public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances begets criminal behavior and tends to create
                  undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity are disorderly
                  conduct, prostitution, drug trafficking and drug use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified
                  with nudity are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and
                  allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a
                  consequence of the criminal behavior herein above described and acceleration of community blight by the
                  concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Accordingly, it is in the best interests of the health,
                  welfare, safety and morals of the community to reduce the adverse impacts of adult entertainment facilities by
                  avoiding the concentration of such uses, so as to reduce the negative impacts of adult entertainment facilities or
                  adult uses upon other business uses, neighborhood property values, residential areas and public and semipublic
                  uses; to ensure that adult uses and adult entertainment facilities do not impede development, redevelopment and
                  neighborhood revitalization efforts; and so as to avoid allowing adult entertainment and adult uses in heavily
                  used public pedestrian areas. Therefore, the limitation of adult uses and adult entertainment to certain prescribed
                  areas of Bloomingdale is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to
                  minimize the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with
                  establishments which provide or establish adult entertainment or adult uses. To that end, this ordinance is hereby
                  adopted.
                  (2)
                  Permissible use in district I-2. Adult entertainment facilities where adult entertainment is sponsored, allowed,
                  encouraged, condoned, presented, sold or offered to members of the public over 18 years of age shall be a
                  permissible use in district I-2.
                  A.

                  are not for the purposes of entertainment, promotion, publicity, or notoriety for the establishment shall not
                  constitute adult entertainment as defined in this section; provided further that nothing herein shall be deemed to
                  make legal any conduct that may otherwise be prohibited by law.
                  B.

                  --- (2) ---
                  Editor's note— An ordinance adopted Jan. 4, 2007, repealed the former art. IX, §§ 900—916, and enacted a
                  new article as set out herein. The former art. IX pertained to similar subject matter and was derived from §
                  1(900)—(916) of an ordinance adopted Oct. 17, 2002.
                  Sec. 900. - Purpose and findings.
                  The mayor and council find that signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a
                  variety of messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic
                  hazard and detriment to property values and the city's overall public welfare as an aesthetic nuisance. By
                  enacting this ordinance, the mayor and council intend to:
                  (a)
                  Balance the rights of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be
                  protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
                  (b)
                  Protect the public health, safety, and welfare;
                  (c)
                  Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards;
                  (d)
                  Maintain the historical image of the city;
                  (e)
                  Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs;
                  (f)
                  Promote economic development; and
                  (g)
                  Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.

                  322/425
                  (8)
                  The size of the parcel on which the sign is to be placed, and the street frontage on the side of the property where
                  the sign will be exhibited.
                  (9)
                  In the case of an illuminated sign, evidence that a licensed electrical contractor has examined the sign plans and
                  specifications respecting all wiring and connections and has concluded, upon such examination, that they comply
                  with the city's electrical code.
                  (10)
                  Such other information as the city shall require to demonstrate full compliance with this and all other laws and
                  ordinances of the city.
                  (c)
                  Time for consideration. The city shall process all sign permit applications within 30 business days of the city's
                  actual receipt of a completed application and a sign permit fee. The clerk shall give notice to the applicant of the
                  decision of the city by hand delivery or by mailing a notice, by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the
                  address on the permit application on or before the 30th business day after the city's receipt of the completed
                  application. If mailed, notice shall be deemed to have been given upon the date of mailing in conformity with
                  this section. If the city fails to act within the 30-day period, the permit shall be deemed to have been granted.
                  (d)
                  Denial and revocation.
                  (1)
                  Procedure. The city shall deny permits to applicants that submit applications for signs that do not comply with
                  the provisions of this ordinance, incomplete applications, and applications containing any false material
                  statements. Violation of any provision of this ordinance will be grounds for terminating a permit granted by the
                  city for the erection of a sign. Should it be determined that a sign permit was issued pursuant to an incomplete
                  application or an application containing a false material statement, or that a permit has been erroneously issued
                  in violation of this ordinance, the clerk shall revoke the permit. Should the city deny a permit, the reasons for the
                  denial are to be stated in writing and mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address on the
                  permit application on or before the 30th business day after the city's receipt of the application. Any application
                  denied and later resubmitted shall be deemed to have been submitted on the date of resubmission, instead of the
                  date of the original submission. No permit shall be denied or revoked, except for due cause as hereinafter
                  defined, and the applicant is granted a public hearing before a hearing officer designated by the city. The
                  applicant will be given ten days written notice of the time, place and purpose of the hearing, with a statement of
                  the reason for the denial of the permit application, or the revocation of a permit. "Due cause" is the violation of
                  the provisions of this ordinance, state or federal law, or the submission of an incomplete application or an
                  application containing false material statements.
                  (2)
                  Appeal. An individual whose permit application has been denied or a permittee whose permit has been revoked
                  may appeal the decision of the hearing officer to the city council provided that he/she files written notice of an
                  appeal with the city clerk within ten business days of the hearing officer's decision. Such appeal shall be
                  considered by city council at the next city council meeting held after the city's receipt of the written notice of
                  appeal, provided that notice of appeal is received a minimum of two full business days before the meeting.
                  (3)
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  323/425
                  Petition. In the event an individual whose permit has been denied or revoked is dissatisfied with the decision of
                  the city council, he/she may petition for writ of certiorari to the superior court as provided by law.
                  (e)
                  Permit expiration. A sign permit shall become null and void if the sign for which the permit was issued has not
                  been completed and installed within six months after the date of issuance. No refunds will be made for permit
                  fees paid for permits that expired due to failure to erect a permitted sign. If later an individual desires to erect a
                  sign at the same location, a new application must be processed and another fee paid in accordance with the fee
                  schedule applicable at such time.
                  (f)
                  Fees. The cost of a permit for each sign or other advertising structure regulated by this ordinance is in the
                  schedule of fees and charges on file in the office of the city clerk. In the event a sign permit application is denied,
                  the base fee amount shall be retained, with the balance being refunded to the applicant.
                  (g)
                  Variances. Where a literal application of the terms of this ordinance, due to special circumstances, would result
                  in an unusual hardship in an individual case, a variance may be granted where all the following conditions exist:
                  (1)
                  Exceptional conditions pertaining to the property where the sign is to be located as a result of its size, shape, or
                  topography, which are not applicable to other lands or structures in the area.
                  (2)
                  The applicant would be deprived of rights that are commonly enjoyed by others similarly situated.
                  (3)
                  Granting the variance would not confer on the applicant any significant privileges which are denied to others
                  similarly situated.
                  (4)
                  The exceptional circumstances are not the result of action by the applicant.
                  (5)
                  The requested variance is the minimum variance necessary to allow the applicant to enjoy the rights commonly
                  enjoyed by others similarly situated.
                  (6)
                  Granting of the variance would not violate more than one standard of this ordinance.
                  (7)
                  Granting the variance would not result in allowing a sign that interferes with road or highway visibility or
                  obstruct or otherwise interfere with the safe and orderly movement of traffic.

                  violation of any applicable law or a public danger, notice of such violation shall be given to the property owner
                  and/or occupant where such sign is located. The property owner and/or occupant shall have 30 days from the
                  date of said notice to remove, repair, or remedy said violation.
                  (5)

                  (a)
                  Billboard signs.
                  (1)
                  Billboard signs shall not exceed 672 square feet of sign area. Billboard sign area shall not exceed 14 feet in
                  height or 48 feet in length.
                  (2)
                  Billboard signs shall only be located on parcels in commercial or industrial zoning districts. Billboard signs shall
                  only be located on parcels in zoning districts that allow such uses and only then when the parcels are adjacent to
                  a designated federal interstate highway. Billboard signs shall be oriented towards the interstate highway.
                  (3)
                  No billboard sign shall be located within 1,000 feet of another billboard sign.
                  (4)
                  No billboard sign shall be located within 500 feet of residential zoned parcels.
                  (5)
                  Billboard signs shall be set back at least 15 feet from the property line of the property on which the sign is
                  erected.
                  (6)
                  No billboard sign shall be located within 500 feet in any direction of a public park, public playground, public
                  recreation area, public forest, scenic area, or cemetery; provided, however, that such sign may be located within
                  500 feet of a public park, public playground, public recreation area, public forest, scenic area, or cemetery when
                  the sign is separated by buildings or other obstructions so that the sign located within the 500-foot zone is not
                  visible from the public park, public playground, public recreation area, public forest, scenic area, or cemetery.
                  (7)
                  A billboard sign shall constitute a self-supporting structure erected on one or two poles permanently attached to a
                  concrete foundation. The foundation shall be designed to carry the weight and windload of the sign, in the soil in
                  which it is placed. The sign's pole(s) and supporting apparatus shall be fabricated only from painted or
                  galvanized steel or metal. No portion of the supporting structure for the sign shall be visible above the
                  advertising display area.

                  Each billboard sign, including its supports, braces, guys, and anchors, shall be maintained in a safe, presentable,
                  and good structural material condition at all times, which includes the repair or replacement of defective parts,
                  painting, repainting, cleaning, and other acts required for the maintenance of said sign.

                  (1)
                  Freestanding signs shall not exceed 200 square feet of total area, which shall include signage and structure, and

                  ii.
                  Parcels less than three acres but greater than 30,000 square feet shall be allowed a maximum total area for the
                  entire parcel of 120 square feet.
                  iii.
                  Parcels less than 30,000 square feet in size and 100 feet or more in width at the front property line shall be

                  The area of a sign structure for any freestanding sign is limited to the same number of square feet as the sign face
                  that it supports.
                  (5)
                  All freestanding signs fronting on a street right-of-way shall be required to be set back at least five feet from the
                  adjacent right-of-way. However, if conditions exist so as to make this impractical, this may be reduced provided
                  such reduction does not create a hazard to motorists or pedestrians and that no portion of the sign is located in
                  the right-of-way.
                  (6)
                  Freestanding signs shall be separated by a distance of not less than 200 foot intervals along each street of the
                  parcel. In the event that a street frontage of less than 200 feet exists for any premises, only one sign shall be
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  331/425

                  section.
                  (7)
                  In lieu of a freestanding sign, a development may use signs on entrance structures such as fences or walls. The
                  number of sign faces is limited to two per entrance, on either side of the entrance and confined to the entrance
                  area. The distance between sign faces shall not exceed 100 feet. Such signs are subject to the size limitations of

                  However, such signs may rest in or be bolted to strong, heavy metal brackets or saddles set not over six feet
                  apart, each of which shall be securely fixed to the wall as provided above. In no case shall any wall sign be
                  secured with wire, strips of wood, or nails.

                  ARTICLE X. - SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS FOR PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS, PATIO HOUSES AND
                  CLUSTER DEVELOPMENTS
                  Sec. 1000. - Exceptions for innovative design.
                  Planned unit developments, patio houses, and cluster developments as defined in this ordinance are recognized as
                  being desirable for the conservation and more efficient use of open space, utilities, energy, and public services
                  than the conventional pattern of land development. In the best interest of the long range development plans of the
                  city, therefore, the planning commission is hereby empowered to make certain exceptions to the provisions of
                  this ordinance in order to encourage new and innovative approaches to land development. Such exceptions shall
                  permit flexibility of design and construction and provide for ways to enclose outdoor space as a useful extension
                  of the living areas in a manner consistent with the preservation of property values within established areas but
                  shall not permit structures or use of land that might endanger health, safety, or natural drainage.
                  Sec. 1001. - Procedure.
                  A two-step procedure is used to establish a PUD district. First, a sketch plan of the proposed development is
                  required for review by the planning commission. Once the planning commission has completed its review, its
                  comments on the proposed development will be forwarded to the developer. It is intended that the planning
                  commission's comments and suggestions be used in preparing the second required element, the plot plan and
                  written report.
                  The plot plan and supporting report will require greater detail and in-depth attention in order to meet the
                  established requirements; however, the flexibility offered to the developer by this zoning district must remain
                  balanced with the need for city officials to make sound decisions based on reliable and specific information.
                  Sec. 1002. - Permitted uses.
                  Any use proposed by the developer and recommended by the planning commission as being compatible with
                  surrounding districts and the intent of the proposed PUD district may be permitted by the city council.
                  Thereafter, the uses permitted in the district shall be restricted to those proposed, approved and adopted
                  according to procedures set forth as follows.
                  Sec. 1003. - Sketch plan process.
                  Prior to the filing of a plot for a planned development, a sketch plan shall be submitted to the building inspector
                  and planning commission. The sketch plan may be a freehand pencil sketch. When submitted, the sketch plan
                  shall include the following information:

                  and the city council may require.
                  Any request pertaining to the establishment of a PUD zoning district shall be considered an amendment to the
                  zoning ordinance and shall be administered and processed in accordance with the regulations set forth in article
                  XIV, with regards to application requirements, planning commission review, and public hearings. If approved by
                  the city council, the plot plan and all information submitted in conjunction with the proposal shall be adopted as
                  part of the planned unit development district amendment.
                  All further development shall conform to the standards adopted for the district, regardless of any changes in
                  ownership. Any proposed changes in the development of the district shall be treated as additional amendments.
                  In any event where it is determined by the city council that development in the planned unit development district
                  is not in accordance with the standards adopted for the district, the city council shall be empowered to amend the
                  ordinance to place parts or all of the property in the planned unit development district in its prior zoning
                  classification.
                  Before approval of [a] planned unit development district, the city council may require a contract with safeguards
                  satisfactory to the city attorney guaranteeing completion of the development plan in a period to be specified by
                  the city council, but which period shall not exceed five years unless extended by the city council for due cause
                  shown. Such guarantee may include the submission of a performance bond in the amount as set by the city
                  council. In any case, failure to begin substantial development (issuance of a building permit in the amount of at
                  least $5,000.00) within two years of the effective date of approval shall automatically void the development plan
                  and the parcel shall revert back to the zoning classification in effect immediately prior to approval. The violation
                  of any provision of the plot plan and written report, as submitted and approved under the provisions provided
                  herein, shall constitute a violation of this ordinance.

                  except in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance, unless he receives a variance as provided by this
                  ordinance.
                  The building inspector shall issue sign permits in accordance with the provisions of the building code, or other
                  laws in effect. Unlawful signs shall be made to comply with all regulations or shall be removed in accordance
                  with the appropriate provisions set forth in the building code or this ordinance.
                  Sec. 1103. - Certificate of occupancy.
                  It shall be unlawful to use or occupy or permit the use or occupancy of any building or premises, or both, or parts
                  thereof hereafter created, erected, changed, converted, or wholly or partly altered or enlarged in its use or
                  structure until a certificate of occupancy shall have been issued therefor by the building inspector stating that the
                  proposed use of the building or land conforms to the requirements of this ordinance and other codes and
                  ordinances adopted by the city.
                  No nonconforming structure or use shall be changed, or extended, until a certificate of occupancy shall have
                  been issued by the building inspector.
                  No permit for erection, alteration, moving, or repair of any building shall be issued until an application for a
                  period not exceeding six months during alterations or partial occupancy of a building pending its completion,
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  345/425
                  provided that such temporary certificate may include such conditions and safeguards as will protect the safety of
                  the occupants and the public.
                  Sec. 1104. - Conditional and temporary uses.
                  Conditional uses, as listed in article VI, are declared to possess characteristics which require certain controls in
                  order to insure compatibility with other uses in the district within which they are proposed for location.
                  (1104.1) General requirements. Conditional uses shall be permitted subject to a determination by the building
                  inspector that they conform to all conditions set forth by the board of appeals as required by article XIII [XII],

                  (1104.2) Conditional use administration and duration. Applications for permission to build, erect, or locate a

                  (f)
                  All temporary certificates of zoning compliance may be renewed provided that it is determined that said use is
                  clearly of a temporary nature, will not increase traffic congestion and will not create a nuisance to surrounding
                  uses.
                  Sec. 1105. - Expiration of building permit.
                  If the work described in any building permit has not begun within six months from the date of issuance thereof,
                  said permit shall expire; it shall be cancelled by the building inspector, and written notice thereof shall be given
                  to the persons affected.

                  shall be fined, as determined by the court, for each offense. Each day such violation continues shall constitute a
                  separate offense.
                  Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
                  remedy any violation.
                  Sec. 1108. - Appeal from the decision of the building inspector.

                  shall be presented first to the building inspector and that such questions shall be presented to the city council,
                  only on appeal from the decision of the building inspector.
                  ARTICLE XII. - APPEALS PROCESS
                  Sec. 1200. - Procedures for the appeal process.
                  (1)
                  Any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the building and zoning inspector or any other
                  administrative office or agency in the enforcement of any section or article adopted in this ordinance may be
                  appealed directly to the city council. Such appeal to the city council must be in writing and it must be filed
                  within 30 days after the building and zoning inspector or any other administrative official has rendered its
                  decision.
                  (2)
                  Upon receipt of such written notice of appeal, the city council shall hold a public hearing on the appeal. [The]
                  city council may reverse, affirm or modify the orders or requirements, but in any event shall issue a written
                  decision on the appeal.
                  Sec. 1201. - Powers and duties in the appeals process.
                  The city council as it pertains to the zoning appeals process shall have the following powers and duties:
                  (1201.01) To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or
                  determination made by the building inspector in the enforcement of this ordinance.
                  (1201.02) To authorize, upon appeal, in specific cases a variance from the terms of the ordinance as will not be
                  contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the
                  ordinance will in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of the ordinance shall be
                  observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Such variance may be granted in such
                  individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a finding of the city council.
                  (a)
                  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question
                  because of its size, shape, or topography;
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  347/425
                  (b)
                  The application of the ordinance to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship;
                  (c)
                  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and
                  (d)
                  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purpose and intent of
                  the ordinance, provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that
                  is prohibited in a given district by the ordinance.
                  (1201.03) To hear and decide special exceptions by the granting of conditional use permits upon a finding by the
                  city council.
                  (a)
                  The special exception or conditional use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of the environment or of
                  other property in relation to cost of servicing or maintaining neighboring properties;
                  (b)
                  The proposed conditional use will not increase local or state expenditures in relation to cost of servicing or
                  maintaining neighboring properties;
                  (c)
                  The establishment of the conditional use will not impede the normal and orderly development of surrounding
                  property for uses predominant in the area; and
                  (d)
                  The location and character of the proposed conditional use as considered to be consistent with a desirable pattern
                  of development for the locality in general.
                  (1201.04) To decide on other matters where a decision of the city council may be specifically required by the
                  provisions of this ordinance. In exercising these powers, the city council may, in conformity with the provisions
                  of this act, reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or may modify the order, requirements, decision, or
                  determination, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken and may
                  issue or direct the issuance of a permit. The council, in the execution of the duties for which appointed, may
                  subpoena witnesses and in case of contempt may certify such fact to the superior court.
                  Sec. 1202. - Appeals from decisions of the city council.
                  Any person aggrieved by any decision of the city council may take an appeal to the superior court within 30 days
                  after the decision of the city council is rendered. Such appeal shall be as specified in O.C.G.A. § 5-3-2 et seq.

                  Sec. 1306. - Airspace zones established.
                  There are hereby created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying within the primary
                  zone, precision instrument approach zones, nonprecision instrument approach zones, transition zones, horizontal
                  zones and conical zones. Such areas and zones are shown on the Savannah International Airport Airspace Zoning
                  Map dated June 1, 1985. Said map is made part of this ordinance to the same extent as if the information set
                  forth on such map was fully designed and incorporated herein, and may be amended subsequent to the adoption
                  thereof. Said map shall be kept on file in the office of the City Clerk of the City of Bloomingdale. The various
                  zones established are shown in illustration number 1 and are defined as follows:
                  (a)
                  Primary zone. An area longitudinally centered on a runway and extending 200 feet each end of that runway. The
                  width of the primary zone is 1,000 feet for a nonprecision instrument approach with visibility minimums as low
                  as three-fourths of a statute mile, and for precision instrument runways. No structure or obstruction will be
                  permitted within the primary zone that is not part of the landing and takeoff facilities and is of a greater height
                  than the nearest point on the runway centerline.
                  (b)
                  Approach zones. An area longitudinally centered on the extended runway centerline and extending outward from
                  each end of the primary zone. An approach zone is designed for each runway based upon the type of approach
                  available or planned for that runway end.
                  (1)
                  Precision instrument approach zone. An instrument approach zone is established at each end of precision
                  instrument runways. The inner edge of the precision instrument approach zone shall have a width of 1,000 feet at
                  a distance of 200 feet beyond each end of the runway. The inner edge shall then widen uniformly to a width of
                  16,000 feet at a distance of 50,200 feet beyond each end of the runway.
                  (2)
                  Nonprecision instrument approach zones. Nonprecision instrument approach zones are established at each end of
                  the nonprecision runways. The inner edge of the nonprecision instrument approach zone shall have a width of
                  1,000 feet at a distance of 200 feet beyond each end of the runway. The inner edge shall then widen uniformly to
                  a width of 4,000 feet for that end of a nonprecision instrument runway having a nonprecision instrument
                  approach with visibility minimums as low as three-fourths statute miles. This type of approach zone extends to a
                  horizontal distance of 10,200 feet beyond each end of the runway.
                  (c)
                  Transitional zones. Transition zones are established adjacent to each precision and nonprecision instrument
                  runway. They extend outward from the sides of the primary and approach zones and connect to the horizontal
                  and conical zones. Transitional zones are further established adjacent to the precision instrument approach zone
                  which projects through and beyond the limits of the conical zone, extending a distance of 5,000 feet measured
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  351/425
                  horizontally, from the edge of the precision instrument approach zone perpendicular to the extended centerline of
                  the runway.
                  (d)
                  Horizontal zone. A horizontal zone is the area within the perimeter of a horizontal plane that is constructed by
                  swinging arcs of specified radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway of each airport
                  and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs. The radius of each arc is 10,000 feet for all
                  runways at the airport. The radius of the arc specified for each end of the runway will have the same arithmetical
                  value. That value will be the highest composite value determined for either end of the runway. When a 5,000 foot
                  arc is encompassed by tangents connecting two adjacent 10,000 foot arcs, the 5,000 foot arch shall be
                  disregarded on the construction of the perimeter of the horizontal plane. The horizontal zone does not include the
                  precision and nonprecision approach zones, and the transition zones.
                  (e)
                  Conical zone. A conical zone is established as the area that begins at the periphery of the horizontal zone and
                  extends outward therefrom a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet. The conical zone does not include the approach
                  zones and transition zones.

                  Sec. 1307. - Height limits established.
                  Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or
                  maintained in any zone to a height in excess of the height limit herein established for such zone. If any structure
                  or tree is erected, altered, allowed to grow, or maintained in an area located in more than one zone, then that
                  structure or tree will be considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various
                  zones are hereby established and defined as follows:
                  (a)
                  Precision instrument approach zone. One foot in height for each 50 feet in horizontal distance, beginning at a
                  point 200 feet from and at the centerline elevation of the end of the instrument runway and extending to a
                  distance of 10,200 feet from the end of the runway (10,000 feet from the ends of the primary zone); thence one
                  foot in height for each 40 feet in horizontal distance to a point 50,200 feet from the end of the runway (50,000
                  feet from the ends of the primary zone).
                  (b)
                  Nonprecision instrument approaches. One foot vertically for each 34 feet in horizontal distance, beginning at a
                  point 200 feet from, and at the centerline elevation of the nonprecision instrument runway and extending to a
                  point 10,200 feet from the end of the runway (10,000 feet from the ends of the primary zone).
                  (c)
                  Transitional zone. This area extending outward from the sides of the primary zone and approach zones
                  connecting them to the horizontal and conical zones. Height limits within the transitional zone are the same as
                  the primary zone or approach zone at the boundary line where it adjoins and increases at a rate of one foot
                  vertically for every seven feet horizontally, with the horizontal distance measured at right angles to the runway
                  centerline and extended centerline, until the height matches the height of the horizontal zone or conical zone, or
                  for a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the side of the part of the precision approach zone that extends
                  beyond the conical zone.

                  Horizontal zone. One hundred fifty feet above established airport elevation.
                  (e)
                  Conical zone. The area extending outward from the periphery of the horizontal zone for a distance of 4,000 feet.
                  Height limitations for structure[s] in the conical zone are 150 feet above the airport height at the inner boundary
                  with permitted height increasing one foot vertically every 20 feet to a height of 350 feet above the airport
                  elevation.

                  Sec. 1308. - Nonconforming obstructions.
                  The regulations prescribed by this ordinance shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or other
                  change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations when adopted or amended, or to
                  otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use. Nothing herein contained shall require any
                  change in the construction or alteration of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior
                  to the adoption of or to any amendments to this ordinance and is diligently prosecuted and completed within six
                  months thereof.

                  (a)
                  No nonconforming obstructions or trees may be erected, replaced, substantially altered or repaired, rebuilt,
                  allowed to grow higher, or replanted, in any zone created in this ordinance unless a permit is secured from the
                  zoning administrator, authorizing such replacement, change or repair, except as follows:
                  1.
                  No permit shall be required for any structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when
                  because of terrain, land contour or topographic features such structure would extend above the height limits
                  prescribed for the following areas:
                  a.
                  Within the entire limits of the horizontal, conical, or transitional zones.
                  b.
                  Within the limits of the precision instrument approach zones.
                  (b)
                  Each application shall indicate the purpose for which it is desired, with sufficient particularity to determine
                  whether the resulting use or structure would conform to the regulations prescribed in this ordinance. If such
                  determination is in the affirmative, the permit applied for shall be granted.
                  (c)
                  No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation or an airport hazard or permit a
                  nonconforming use, structure or tree to be made or become higher, or become a greater hazard to air navigation,
                  than it was on the effective date of this ordinance (February 20, 1986), or than it is when the application for a
                  permit is made.

                  (1501.37) Planned unit development. A group of three or more buildings constructed on a plot of ground at least
                  two acres not subdivided which provides for common open spaces and a variety of choice in housing types and
                  land utilization. Land ownership or rental patterns may vary with rental units, cooperatives, and condominiums
                  being choices open to PUD developers. If common open spaces, including streets are not dedicated for public
                  use, legal agreements shall include provision for adequate future maintenance. The terms "planned unit
                  development" and "PUD" are interchangeable.
                  (Sec. 1501.37.1) Planned development overlay district. The purpose of this district shall be to provide areas
                  within which comprehensive development plans shall be prepared and reviewed by the planning commission and
                  mayor and council in order to secure an orderly development pattern. Such district shall be considered "overlay"
                  districts, and the uses permitted in such district shall be those uses permitted in the zoning district which they
                  overlay. Property may be rezoned to a "P" classification on the finding by the planning commission that:
                  (a)
                  Such rezoning would be in the community's best interest.
                  (b)
                  Unplanned and uncoordinated development could result in potential problems in such areas as traffic flow,
                  schools, recreation and open spaces and public facilities.
                  (c)
                  To ensure an orderly growth and development, it is appropriate to acquire approval of specific development plans
                  by the mayor and council.

                  (1501.39) Signs, number and surface area. For the purpose of determining number of signs, a sign shall be
                  considered to be a single display surface or display device containing elements organized, related, and composed
                  to form a unit. Where matter is displayed in a random manner without organized relationship of elements, or
                  where there is reasonable doubt about the relationship of elements, each element shall be considered to be a
                  single sign. The surface area of a sign shall be computed as including the entire area within a regular geometric
                  form or combinations of regular geometric forms comprising all of the display area of the sign and including all
                  of the elements of the matter displayed. Frames and structural members not bearing advertising matter shall not
                  be included in computation of surface area.

                  action on the part of the property owner, a literal enforcement of this ordinance would result in unnecessary and
                  undue hardship. Such modification may not authorize a principal or accessory use of the property which is not

                  Should any section or provision of this ordinance be declared invalid or unconstitutional by any court of

                  APPENDIX A. - STATE GUIDELINES FOR MUNICIPALITIES IN DECIDING "HARDSHIP"
                  "Unnecessary hardship" is a particularly difficult criterion as there can be no hard and fact definition that will fit
                  all cases. It is necessary to hear all of the facts and measure each case on its own merits. Among the guides based
                  upon legal precedent to the meaning of the phrase "unnecessary hardship" are the following:
                  (A)
                  The premises cannot be used in a manner permitted by the ordinance unless the variance is granted.
                  (B)
                  Strict application of the terms of the ordinance will preclude its use for any purpose to which the land is
                  reasonably adopted.
                  (C)
                  Inability to put the property to its most profitable use does not constitute "unnecessary hardship."
                  (D)
                  The hardship must be a compelling force.
                  (E)
                  Mere inconvenience to the applicant is not sufficient grounds for "unnecessary hardship."
                  (F)
                  Value alone is not a proper criterion in determining "unnecessary hardship."
                  (G)
                  The burden of proof of unnecessary hardship rests upon the applicant, and, without such proof, such variance
                  must be denied.
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  365/425
                  (H)
                  The hardship must be peculiar to the property in question and not be common to other properties in the district.

                  valid for one year. If final plans have not been received on a development which has been granted preliminary
                  plan approval on or before the end of this one-year period, then the plan of such development shall be
                  resubmitted for preliminary approval: provided, however, that this time may be extended unless changes have
                  occurred in this ordinance, or in the character of the property surrounding the property of the proposed

                  have been discussed and reviewed with the sponsor, and the sponsor given a period of time which shall not
                  exceed 90 days to corrective action, the planning commission shall recommend disapproval of the final plan to
                  the mayor and council and shall set forth its reasons for such recommendations in writing. Except where an
                  extension of time is authorized by the applicant for final plan review, the planning commission shall have 30
                  days from the date of the submission of a final plan to submit its recommendations on such plan to the mayor and
                  council. Unless such action is taken within 30 days, then such plan shall be deemed to have received a
                  recommendation for approval from the planning commission and the mayor and council may take final action on
                  such plan without waiting further for recommendations of the planning commission.

                  commission may recommend that such requirements be varied, provided, however, that in so doing the intent and

                  areas.
                  (b)
                  Street jogs. Street jogs, or centerline offsets in the horizontal alignment of streets across intersections of less than

                  (c)
                  Intersections. The centerline of no more than two streets shall intersect at any one point. Streets shall be laid out

                  (e)
                  Subdivisions on arterial streets. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, the
                  mayor and councilmembers may require marginal access streets, reverse frontage with screen planting contained
                  in a nonaccess reservation along the rear property line, deep lots with rear service lanes, or such other treatment
                  as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and
                  local traffic.

                  Street names. All streets within a subdivision hereafter established shall be named. No name shall be used which

                  (l)
                  Additional right-of-way. A proposed subdivision that includes a platted street that does not conform to the
                  minimum right-of-way requirements of this ordinance shall provide for the dedication of additional right-of-way
                  along either one or both sides of said street so that the minimum right-of-way required by this ordinance can be
                  established. If the proposed subdivision abuts only one side of said street, then a minimum of one-half of the
                  required extra right-of-way shall be dedicated by such subdivision.
                  (m)
                  Street access to adjoining property. Whenever the mayor and councilmembers find that street access to adjoining
                  property is needed, a street right-of-way shall be extended to the boundary of such property and such right-ofway shall be dedicated to the public as an unopened street. When such unopened street is required for access to
                  property, then the developer of the property for which access is required shall be responsible for opening and
                  improving the unopened street.

                  Street markers. Street name markers, which shall be constructed to city specifications, shall be installed at all

                  Major thoroughfare plan. When the major thoroughfare plan of the community shows proposed arterial streets
                  and collector streets within a proposed subdivision, the subdivider shall design the street system within such
                  subdivision to conform with the location and arrangement of such arterial streets and collector streets.
                  (p)
                  Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be installed on both sides of all major arterials, secondary arterials, and collector
                  streets within single-family residential, multifamily residential and commercial subdivisions, and one side of all
                  marginal access streets within multifamily residential and commercial subdivisions in accordance with the

                  design requirements of this ordinance; provided the mayor and councilmembers may approve a residential,
                  commercial and/or industrial lot which does not abut a public street but which is served by a perpetual privatelymaintained access easement which meets the design and construction of this ordinance.
                  (b)
                  Lot lines. Side lot lines shall be as nearly as practical at right angles to straight lines and radial to curved street
                  lines.
                  (c)
                  Corner lots. Corner lots for residential use shall be provided with sufficient width and depth to permit the

                  (d)
                  Double frontage lots. Double frontage lots shall only be permitted where it shall be found necessary to separate a
                  development from major arterials or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.
                  (e)
                  Minimum lot elevation. No lot shall be approved that does not meet the requirements of the city's flood control

                  floodwaters.
                  (506.2) Private water and private sewerage. Where either public water or public sewers or both are not available

                  (e)
                  Proposed final contours in dashed line at one-foot intervals and based on mean sea level datum.
                  (f)
                  Proposed building lines.
                  (g)

                  (i)
                  The expected limits of the 100-year flood where appropriate.

                  (a)
                  Name of proposed subdivision, scale of the plat, north arrow, date, size of the tract being subdivided, key map
                  showing location of the proposed subdivision in the city. A statement from the subdivider shall be placed on the
                  preliminary plat which shall describe the method by which storm sewers, sanitary sewers, and water facilities
                  will be provided. If septic tanks or individual waste disposal systems are to be used in a subdivision, then
                  percolation tests shall be made in accordance with the county health department requirements and the results of
                  such tests, together with a contour map showing the site of each test hole, shall accompany the preliminary map.

                  Grading and drainage plans shall be submitted with each subdivision application. If the required drainage plans
                  reveal that a request for subdivision approval would overload the capacity of the channel downstream or increase
                  flood stages upstream, the subdivision approval permit shall be denied, unless equivalent flow and storage
                  capacity is replaced and maintained by the owner within the floodplain affected.
                  (d)
                  When the preliminary plan includes only a part of the tract on which the subdivider has an interest, the developer
                  shall submit a tentative street plan for all of said tract.

                  All exhibits accompanying the preliminary plan shall be prepared by a registered civil engineer and shall contain
                  the seal of such engineer.
                  (602.2) Filing of preliminary plan. The preliminary plan shall be filed with the planning commission not less
                  than 20 days prior to the regular planning commission meeting at which it is considered.
                  (602.3) Action on preliminary plan. If the planning commission finds that the proposed design of the subdivision
                  shown on the preliminary plan complies with the design requirements of these regulations, it shall recommend
                  approval of such preliminary plan to the mayor and council. If the planning commission finds that the proposed
                  design of the subdivision shown on the preliminary plan does not comply with the design requirements of these
                  regulations, then the planning commission shall either recommend disapproval of such plan or shall recommend
                  approval of such plan on the condition that specified violations are corrected prior to the submittal of the final
                  plat. When the planning commission recommends disapproval of a preliminary plan, it shall give the developer
                  the reasons for such disapproval in writing. Except where an extension of time is authorized by the applicant for
                  preliminary plan review, the planning commission shall have 30 days from the date of the submission on a
                  preliminary plan to act on such plan. Unless action is taken on an application for preliminary plan review within
                  the 30-day period, a written recommendation of approval shall be issued by the planning commission on demand
                  of the applicant. The mayor and council, upon receipt of a recommendation from the planning commission, shall
                  hold a public hearing thereon and shall notify in writing all abutting property owners and the developer of the
                  subdivision of the time, date and place of said hearing. The mayor and council may either approve, disapprove or
                  require modifications to the subdivision plat.
                  (602.4) When preliminary plan approved, work may proceed. When a developer receives approval of the
                  preliminary plan showing the design of the proposed subdivision, the developer may proceed with the
                  construction of the subdivision. Such construction shall conform with the design submitted to and approved by
                  the mayor and council.
                  (602.5) Time limit on preliminary approval. The mayor's and council's approval of a preliminary plan shall be
                  valid for one year. If work has not started on a subdivision which has been granted preliminary plan approval on
                  or before the end of this one-year period, then the plan of such subdivision shall be resubmitted for preliminary
                  approval; provided, however, that this time may be extended unless changes have occurred in this ordinance, or
                  in the character of the property surrounding the property of the proposed subdivision which makes it necessary to
                  revise the design of the proposed subdivision.
                  Sec. 603. - Final plat.
                  Before a plat of a subdivision is recorded with the Clerk of the Superior Court of Chatham County and the lots
                  thereon offered for sale, an original and four prints of a final plat showing the final design of the subdivision
                  shall be submitted to the planning commission for review. Until a final plat of a subdivision has been submitted
                  to and reviewed by the planning commission and approved and signed by the mayor and the clerk of the city, the
                  Clerk of the Superior Court of Chatham County shall not record the plat of such subdivision, nor shall the owner
                  or agent of such subdivision be authorized to transfer or sell any of the land within such subdivision by reference
                  to a plat. For large subdivisions the final plat may be submitted for approval progressively in contiguous sections
                  satisfactory to the planning commission.
                  (603.1) Final plat requirements. The original copy of the final plat shall be drawn on 18-inch by 24-inch sheets
                  of linen with black India ink at a scale of not less than 200 feet to the inch. Where necessary, the final plat may
                  be several linen sheets accompanied by an index sheet showing the entire subdivision. The final plat shall
                  contain the following information:
                  (a)
                  Primary control points to which all dimensions, angles, bearings, and similar data on the plat shall be referred.

                  (l)
                  Statement by owner dedicating streets, rights-of-way, easements, and any sites for public use. Such dedications
                  must be formally accepted by the mayor and council of the city before such dedications shall be binding on the
                  city.

                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  389/425
                  (603.2) Certification from county health department. If lots are not to be served by either public sewers or public
                  water, or both, then the final plat shall be accompanied by a certificate from the county health department
                  certifying health department approval of the water supply system and/or waste disposal system to be used and
                  health department approval of lot sizes and lot widths established in such subdivision.
                  (603.3) Certificate from engineer. At the time the final plat is submitted, it shall be accompanied by a certificate
                  from the developer's engineer certifying that the subdivider has complied with both of the following conditions:
                  (a)
                  All improvements have been installed in accordance with the requirements of this ordinance and in accordance
                  with the design approved by the mayor and council on the preliminary plan; and
                  (b)
                  A bond, escrow account or certified check has been posted, which is available to the city, and in sufficient
                  amount to assure the completion of all required improvements, as well as to assure the maintenance thereof for a
                  period of not less than 12 months from completion. The mayor and council may reduce the bond or escrow
                  account 50 percent at the end of six months. At the end of the second six months, the developer shall request an
                  inspection, and if no faults or failures have developed, the mayor and council shall release the bond or escrow.
                  Such bond or escrow shall remain in force until released by the mayor and council after due inspection of said
                  improvements and shall not automatically expire at the end of 12 months.
                  (603.4) Filing final plat. The final plat shall be filed with the planning commission not less than 20 days prior to
                  a regular meeting of the planning commission.
                  (603.5) Action on final plat. If the planning commission finds that all the requirements of this ordinance have
                  been met, it shall recommend approval of the final plat and submit such plat to the mayor and council. If the
                  planning commission finds that all the requirements of this ordinance have not been met, and after deficiencies
                  have been discussed and reviewed with the sponsor, and the sponsor given a period of time which shall not
                  exceed 90 days to take corrective action, the planning commission shall recommend disapproval of the final plat
                  to the mayor and council and shall set forth its reasons for such recommendations in writing. Except where an
                  extension of time is authorized by the applicant for final plat review, the planning commission shall have 30 days
                  from the date of the submission of a final plat to submit its recommendations on such plat to the mayor and
                  council. Unless such action is taken within such 30-day period, then such plat shall be deemed to have received a
                  recommendation for approval from the planning commission and the mayor and council may take final action on
                  such plat without waiting further for the recommendations of the planning commission.
                  (a)
                  When the final plat has been approved, the planning commission shall present the final plat to the clerk of the
                  superior court of Chatham County to be recorded. The planning commission shall provide the subdivider with
                  the subdivision map book number and page number in which the subdivision has been recorded by the clerk of
                  the superior court. The cost of such recording shall be paid by the subdivider and shall be deposited with the
                  planning commission prior to such recording.
                  (b)
                  After the final plat of the subdivision has been recorded, then all lots shown on such subdivision may be made
                  available for sale and such subdivision shall be entitled to all privileges and services available to other
                  subdivisions within the city.
                  (603.6) Revisions to recorded plat. The subdivider shall file with the planning commission copies of the
                  proposed revision to a recorded plat together with all supporting information as required by these regulations.
                  Proposed revisions to a recorded plat which alter or change in any way the street and/or utility layout of said plat
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  390/425
                  shall be submitted as a preliminary plat in accordance with section 602 of these regulations. Proposed revisions
                  to a recorded plat which do not alter or change in any way the street and/or utility layout of said plat shall be
                  submitted as a final plat in accordance with section 603 of these regulations.
                  Sec. 604. - Minor subdivision.
                  Minor subdivisions may be submitted as final plats, and shall comply with the requirements of these regulations,
                  including minimum finished floor elevation requirements, with the following exceptions:
                  (a)
                  Minor subdivisions shall be processed as a major subdivision if requested by either the planning commission,
                  other review agency, or the developer.
                  (b)
                  Topographic information shall not be required, unless specifically requested by the city.
                  (c)
                  Percolation information shall not be required, unless requested by the health department.
                  (d)
                  Only one benchmark shall be required. An existing accessible benchmark within 200 feet of petitioner's property,
                  if shown on the plat, shall satisfy this requirement.
                  (e)
                  The developer shall submit a drainage plan for approval if requested by the city.
                  (f)
                  Provided that where a series of minor subdivisions are developed or proposed immediately adjacent to one
                  another, the planning commission or other review agency may require the developer to comply with the
                  procedure for major subdivisions.
                  Sec. 605. - Fees.
                  Subdivision platting fees shall be in accordance with the following schedule:

                  ARTICLE VII. - EXEMPTIONS AND MODIFICATIONS
                  Sec. 700. - Exemptions.
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  392/425
                  The following types of subdivision shall not be defined as subdivisions and shall be exempted from the
                  requirements of this ordinance, pursuant to the provisions of the Act authorizing the adoption of this ordinance:
                  (a)
                  The subdivision of a tract of land into two or more lots, each having an area of five acres or more, and in which
                  no new street is required. (The dividing of a tract into two or more lots of five acres or more each, which requires
                  new access roads, shall be defined as a subdivision under the terms of this ordinance.)
                  (b)
                  The combination or recombination of portions of previously platted lots where the total number of lots is not
                  increased and the resultant lots are equal to the standards set forth in this ordinance.
                  Sec. 701. - Final plat approval only.
                  In the case of a subdivision which shall have lots fronting only on existing, open, and public streets and which
                  does not require a new street, the developer of such subdivision shall only be required to submit a final plat. The
                  mayor and council shall approve such final plat if they find that the subdivision described thereon complies with
                  all of the applicable requirements of this ordinance.
                  Sec. 702. - Variance.
                  When a peculiar shape, or the topography of a tract of land, or other unusual condition, makes it impractical for a
                  developer to comply with the literal interpretations of the design requirements of this ordinance, the planning
                  commission may recommend that such requirements be varied, provided, however, that in so doing the intent and
                  purposes of this ordinance are not violated.
                  ARTICLE VIII. - PENALTIES
                  Sec. 800. - Violation a misdemeanor.

                  CABLEVISION OF SAVANNAH
                  FRANCHISE AGREEMENT
                  This franchise agreement is made and entered into on this 1st day of December, 1994, by and between the City
                  of Bloomingdale ("grantor" or "city") and Cablevision of Savannah ("grantee" or "cablevision"), a division of
                  Time Warner Cable, a division of Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership.
                  WITNESSETH
                  WHEREAS, the city is authorized to grant and renew franchises for the installation, operation, and maintenance
                  of cable television systems, and otherwise regulate cable television within the city's boundaries by virtue of
                  federal and state statutes; and
                  WHEREAS, the grantee has agreed to comply with the provisions of the Bloomingdale Cable Communications
                  Franchise Ordinance (the "cable ordinance"); and
                  WHEREAS, the city has made a review of the grantee, its record of service, its facilities, the cable-ready
                  community needs of the city for both the present and the future, the grantee's ability to carry out its
                  commitments, and the grantee's overall financial, legal, and technical qualifications to hold a city franchise; and
                  WHEREAS, the city has determined that it would serve the public interest to grant the franchise, but only under
                  the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, and the grantee desires to obtain a franchise under these
                  conditions;
                  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises contained herein, the parties hereby agree as
                  follows:
                  AGREEMENT
                  FOOTNOTE(S):
                  --- (2) ---
                  Editor's note— This Cablevision of Savannah franchise was adopted December 1, 1994. Obvious misspellings
                  and punctuation errors have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, headings and catchlines have
                  been made uniform and the same system of capitalization, citation to state statutes, and expression of numbers in
                  text as appears in the Code of Ordinances has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets.
                  1. - Definitions.
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  400/425
                  As used in this document, a word or term shall have the meaning ascribed to it in the cable ordinance unless it is
                  apparent from the context that such word or term has a different meaning or unless such word or term is
                  specifically defined herein.
                  2. - Grant of authority to operate and term of franchise.
                  2.1. Grant. The city hereby grants to the grantee the privilege to construct, erect, operate, and maintain a cable
                  television system in, upon, along, above, over, and under the streets, alleys, public ways, public places, and other
                  specific locations mutually agreeable to the city and grantee within the city's boundaries, which boundaries also
                  constitute the grantee's area of service.
                  2.2. Nonexclusive franchise. This grant of authority or franchise (as it is sometimes referred to in this franchise
                  agreement and in the cable ordinance) to operate a cable television system in the city and the right to use and
                  occupy the streets, alleys, public ways, and places for the purposes herein set forth shall not be exclusive. The
                  city reserves the right, at its discretion, to grant franchises under the terms of the cable ordinance to other cable
                  operators. The city represents to grantee that the city does not intend to grant to any other cable operator a
                  franchise of material provisions of which are in the aggregate or on the whole more favorable to such other cable
                  operator than the material provisions of grantee's franchise under this franchise agreement, it being the intent of
                  the city to treat all franchise grantees fairly and equitably in the aggregate.
                  2.3. Fairness to all franchisees. If the city exercises its right to grant one or more franchises for the construction,
                  operation or maintenance of a cable system in the franchise area, in addition to the franchise granted pursuant to
                  this agreement, and the agreement pursuant to which any additional cable franchise is granted imposes benefits
                  and burdens on the franchisee which, on balance, are materially more advantageous to the franchisee than those
                  imposed on the grantee by this agreement, the grantee may seek renegotiation of terms and conditions of this
                  agreement as set forth in section XXXII(c) of the cable ordinance.
                  2.4. Term of franchise. This grant of authority shall run for a term beginning on the date hereof (which shall be of
                  the effective date of this franchise) and ending December 15, 2004. This grant of authority may be extended for
                  an additional ten-year term. The grant of authority shall be extended for an additional five years if the grantee
                  modernizes the cable system as specified in section 3.5 of this agreement.
                  2.5. Binding contract. The franchise (including all of grantee's particular rights, powers, protection, privileges,
                  immunities, and obligations associated therewith as the same exist on the date hereof) granted pursuant to this
                  franchise agreement shall constitute a legally binding contract between the city and grantee, and as such cannot
                  be amended, modified, or changed unilaterally by the city (that is, without the consent of grantee) in any manner
                  whatsoever, whether, by ordinance, rule, regulation, or otherwise, to impose on grantee more stringent or
                  burdensome requirements or conditions; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall preclude the city
                  from the proper exercise of its general regulatory and police powers, and/or powers of eminent domain.
                  3. - Operation and services.
                  3.1. Insurance. In satisfaction of its obligation under subsection XXVII of the cable ordinance, grantee shall
                  maintain at all times liability insurance as described in section XXVII of the cable ordinance.
                  3.2. Service standards. The grantee shall comply with the consumer service standards in accordance with the
                  FCC.
                  3.3. Technical, operational and maintenance standards. The grantee shall comply with the technical, operational,
                  and maintenance standards in accordance with the FCC.
                  3.4. Standby power and override capability. Grantee agrees to comply with sections XVII and XVIII of the
                  ordinance by March 31, 1995.
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  401/425
                  3.5. System modernization and timetable. The grantee agrees to modernize the cable system to 550 megahertz
                  (MHz) if the grantee modernizes the grantee's Savannah cable system to 550 megahertz (MHz), and if the
                  grantee serves the Bloomingdale system and the Savannah system from a common headend. The grantee agrees
                  to such modernization of the Bloomingdale system within one year of the completion of the modernization of the
                  Savannah system.
                  4. - Rates.
                  The city reserves the right to regulate rates for cable service to the extent allowed by federal law.
                  5. - Fees and financial reports.
                  5.1. Effective March 1, 1995, the franchise fee shall be five percent of grantee's gross revenues. Said fee shall be
                  payable annually within 60 days following the end of grantee's fiscal year and shall be computed in accordance
                  with section V of the cable ordinance.
                  5.2. By adoption of this franchise agreement the city hereby approves the increase in franchise fees as required
                  by section V of the ordinance.
                  6. - Representations and warranties.
                  6.1. Except as and only if expressly provided in this franchise or as a result of the city's gross negligence or
                  intentional misconduct, the grantee shall have no claim whatsoever for damages against the city for any loss,
                  cost, or expenses or damage arising out of any provision or requirement of this franchise or the enforcement
                  thereof.
                  6.2. The grantee expressly acknowledges that upon accepting this franchise, it does and did so relying upon its
                  own investigation and understanding of the power and authority of the city to grant this franchise.
                  6.3. The grantee by acceptance of this franchise acknowledges that it has not been induced to enter into this
                  franchise by any understanding or promise or other statement whether verbal or written by or on behalf of the
                  city or by any other third person concerning any term or condition of this franchise not expressed herein.
                  6.4. The grantee acknowledges by acceptance of this franchise that (i) it has carefully read the cable ordinance
                  and this franchise agreement and (ii) the terms and provisions of this cable ordinance are incorporated herein by
                  reference. The grantee hereby certifies that none of the obligations imposed upon it by this franchise agreement
                  is, in the grantee's informed opinion, presently commercially impracticable. Grantee further acknowledges that it
                  has read and is familiar with all applicable federal and state statutes and regulations pertaining to the ownership
                  and operation of a cable television system.
                  6.5. The grantee represents and warrants that it has the power and authority to enter into this franchise agreement
                  by and through the representative who has signed this franchise agreement on its behalf, and that it has the power
                  and ability to do all the acts required of it under this franchise agreement. The grantee shall provide a corporate
                  resolution to that effect simultaneously with the signing hereof and a current certificate of existence from its state
                  of incorporation, and if a foreign corporation, its documentation of its having registered in the State of Georgia.
                  6.6. The grantee enters into this franchise agreement willingly and without coercion, undue influence, or duress.
                  The grantee has not misrepresented or omitted material facts, has not entered into this franchise agreement with
                  intent to act contrary to the provisions herein, and represents and warrants that, so long as it operates a cable
                  television system within Bloomingdale under the franchise herein granted, it will be bound by the terms and
                  conditions of this franchise agreement.
                  6.7. The headnotes or titles to the sections herein are inserted only as a matter of convenience and for reference,
                  and in no way confine, limit, or describe the scope or intent of any provision of this franchise agreement.
                  7. - Severability.
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  402/425
                  If any section or provision of this franchise agreement or any ordinance, law, or document incorporated herein by
                  reference is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unconstitutional or unenforceable, such
                  holding shall be confined in its operation to the section or provision directly involved in the controversy in which
                  such holding shall have been rendered and shall not in any way affect the validity of any other section or
                  provision hereof, except, that the parties shall in good faith renegotiate that section or provision. Both the city
                  and grantee agree to be bound by all terms and conditions of this franchise except as may be now or later
                  determined to be unenforceable by a court of competent and appropriate jurisdiction with proper venue over this
                  franchise.

                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  406/425

                  4.
                  The company shall, in constructing, maintaining, operating, and extending the company's facilities, submit and
                  be subject to all reasonable exercises of the police power by the city. Nothing contained herein, however, shall

                  relocate any distribution facilities from their then-current locations within the streets, alleys, and public places of
                  the city in connection with a public project or improvement, then the company shall relocate, at its expense, the
                  distribution facilities affected by such project or improvement. The company's obligations under this paragraph 6
                  shall apply without regard to whether the company has acquired, or claims to have acquired, an easement or
                  other property right with respect to such distribution facilities and shall not affect the amounts paid or to be paid
                  to the city under the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Section II. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
                  this paragraph 6, the company shall not be obligated to relocate, at its expense, any of the following: (i)
                  distribution facilities that are located on private property at the time relocation is requested or demanded; (ii)
                  distribution facilities that are relocated in connection with sidewalk improvements (unless such sidewalk
                  4/30/2019 Bloomingdale, GA Code of Ordinances
                  407/425
                  improvements are related to or associated with road widenings, the creation of new turn lanes, or the addition of
                  acceleration/deceleration lanes); (iii) streetscape projects or other projects undertaken primarily for aesthetic
                  purposes; or (iv) distribution facilities that are converted from an overhead configuration or installation to an
                  underground configuration or installation.
                  7.
                  The city and the company recognize that both parties benefit from economic development within the city.
                  Accordingly, when it is necessary to relocate any of the company's facilities (whether distribution facilities,
                  transmission lines, transmission structures, or other facilities) within the city, the city and the company shall
                  work cooperatively to minimize costs, delays, and inconvenience to both parties while ensuring compliance with
                  applicable laws and regulations. In addition, the city and the company shall communicate in a timely fashion to
                  coordinate projects included in the city's five-year capital improvement plan, the city's short-term work program,
                  or the city's annual budget in an effort to minimize relocation of the company's facilities. Such communication
                  may include, but is not limited to, (i) both parties' participation in the Georgia Utilities Coordinating Council,
                  Inc. (or any successor organization) or a local utilities coordinating council (or any successor organization) and
                  (ii) both parties' use of the National Joint Utility Notification System (or any successor to such system mutually
                  acceptable to both parties).
                  8.
                  With regard to each streetscape project undertaken by or on behalf of the city, the city shall pay the company in
                  advance for the company's estimated cost to relocate any of the company's facilities (whether distribution
                  facilities, transmission lines, transmission structures, or other facilities) in connection with such project. For each
                  streetscape project, the company shall estimate in good faith the amount of incremental base revenue, if any, that
                  the company will realize as a result of new customer load or expansion of existing customer load attributable to
                  such project; and such estimate shall be based on tariffs in effect at the time that construction of such project
                  begins and shall not include fuel recovery charges, non-electric service billings, or taxes. If such estimate
                  indicates that the company will realize incremental base revenue, the company shall do one of the following,
                  whichever results in greater cost savings to the city: (i) reduce the city's advance payment to the company for
                  relocation costs by ten percent; or (ii) where the city has developed a bona fide marketing plan within 12 months
                  after construction of such project begins, either refund the amount of the company's incremental base revenue
                  during such 12-month period to the city or credit such amount against any future payment due from the city to
                  the company. The city and the company acknowledge and agree that the amount of any refund or credit
                  calculated pursuant to clause (ii) of the foregoing sentence of this paragraph 8 shall not exceed the amount of the
                  city's advance payment to the company for relocation costs associated with such project.
                  Sec. III. - [Right of customers to select an electric supplier.]
                  Be it further ordained that nothing contained in this ordinance shall limit or restrict the right of customers within
                  the corporate limits of the city to select an electric supplier as may hereafter be provided by law.
                  Sec. IV. - [Written acceptance of franchise.]
                  be it further ordained that the company shall, within 90 days from the approval of this ordinance, file the
                  company's written acceptance of the franchise granted in this ordinance with the clerk of the city, so as to form a
                  contract between the company and the city.
                  Sec. V. - [Conflicting ordinances repealed.]
                  Be it further ordained that upon such acceptance all laws and ordinances, and all agreements between the
                  company and the city with respect to the company's use of the city's streets, alleys, and public places, in conflict
                  herewith be and the same shall thereupon stand repealed and terminated, respectively.
