PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of Ware County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1983 Code, as supplemented through May 11, 1998, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the county board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1983 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of David G. Poucher and Jim Jenkins, Code Attorneys, and Vicki L.

                  In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

The petition for such recall election shall be placed in the office of the Judge of the Probate Court and then must be signed by a total of not less than 25 percent of the qualified registered voters of said county who were on the list of registered voters for the last general election. Every person signing such petition must sign the same in the office of the Judge of the Probate Court of Ware County, and it must be signed in the presence of the Judge of the Probate Court or of an employee of the Judge or the Probate Court. The persons sponsoring such petition shall address a written petition signed by 400 or more qualified registered voters of Ware County to the Judge of the Probate Court, petitioning him [or her] to call for a special election to submit the question of whether any such member of the Board of Commissioners shall be recalled.

Any petition presented after such 90-day period shall be void and of no force and effect. It shall then be the duty of the Judge of the Probate Court to determine whether such petition bears the proper percentage of names and to determine the sufficiency of the petition. The Judge of the Probate Court must make his [or her] decision on the sufficiency of the petition within 15 days after the same is formally presented to him [or her]. In the event he [or she] determines that the petition is in order, it shall be his [or her] duty to issue the call for an election and such call shall be issued within five days after he [or she] determines that such petition is in order. He [or she] shall set the date of the election for not less than 30 nor more than 90 days from the date of the issuance of the call and shall publish the date and purpose of such election once a week for two weeks immediately preceding the date thereof. The ballots used in such election shall state the name of the officer whose recall has been petitioned, and shall designate the office involved. The ballot shall have written or printed thereon the following: "Shall (name of officeholder), (name of office) be recalled and removed from office?" The Judge of the Probate Court shall forthwith publish the results of such election, and if a majority of those voting in such election have voted in favor of recall, the office in question shall be vacated from the date of such recall election, and the officer so removed shall not be eligible to reelection or appointment to the unexpired term. It shall be the duty of the Judge of the Probate Court to certify the results of such election to the Secretary of State. If a majority of those voting in such election vote against recall, the officer shall retain his [or her] office. Vacancies created by a recall election shall be filled in the same manner as provided by law for the filling of other vacancies. In the event a recall election results in a majority of votes against recall, no additional recall election against the same officer shall be held for at least two years.

It shall be the duty of any person granted the homestead exemption under subsection (b) of this section to notify the tax commissioner of the county or the designee thereof in the event that person for any reason becomes ineligible for that exemption. 
                  (f)  The exemption granted by this [section] shall not apply to or affect state ad valorem taxes, county or independent school district ad valorem taxes for educational purposes, or municipal ad valorem taxes for municipal purposes.

The value of that property in excess of such exempted amount shall remain subject to taxation. 
                  (c)  A person shall not receive the homestead exemption granted by subsection [(b)] of this section unless the person or person's agent files an affidavit with the tax commissioner of Ware County giving the person's age, and the amount of income which the person and the person's spouse residing within such homestead received during the last taxable year, and such additional information relative to receiving such exemption as will enable the tax commissioner to make a determination as to whether such owner is entitled to such exemption.

                  (f)  The exemption granted by this [section] shall not apply to or affect any state taxes, municipal taxes, independent school district taxes, or Ware County school district taxes for educational purposes.

                  DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

                  Sec. 2-39. - Membership. 
                  The board of commissioners shall consist of five members, who have been previously elected and sworn in as members of such board. 
                  (Code 1983, § 2-2-16) 
                  Sec. 2-40. - Officers. 
                  The principal officers of the board of commissioners shall consist of a chair, who was elected and designated as such by the voters of the county, a vice-chair and a vice-chair pro tempore, who shall be elected from the membership of the said board at its first regular meeting in January of each year. A majority vote of the members of the board of commissioners shall be required for the election of the vice-chair and the vice-chair pro tempore. 
                  (Code 1983, § 2-2-17) 
                  Sec. 2-41. - Powers and duties of chair. 
                  (a)  The chair shall be the chief executive officer of the county government and shall generally supervise, direct and control the administration of the affairs of the county pursuant to the powers conferred upon him by law and pursuant to any adopted resolution of the board of commissioners in regard to matters reserved to the exclusive jurisdiction of the commission. 
                  (b)  The chair shall preside over all meetings of the commission wherein he is present. 
                  (Code 1983, § 2-2-18) 
                  Sec. 2-42. - Code of conduct; governing authority of county. 
                  The members of the Ware County Board of County Commissioners recognize that, when acting as a body, they are the governing authority of Ware County, Georgia. As a board they possess the full power of local government, both legislative, executive and quasijudicial, within the parameters established by the Constitution and laws of the State of Georgia. As individual commissioners, however, each member acknowledges that he has no legal power or authority, and that official action can exist only by majority vote of the board. Accordingly, it is important and in the public interest to establish a code of conduct for county commissioners that addresses conduct both during and outside of public meetings. The ordinance from which this section is derived is adopted in order to preserve the integrity of local government, to promote the efficiency with which local government services are provided, and to protect the county from exposure to liability due to conduct that is unauthorized, ultra vires, or in excess of a commissioner's authority.

                  Sec. 2-43. - Conduct—During meetings. 
                  During the public portions of public meetings and public hearings, members of the Ware County Board of Commissioners shall not: 
                  (1)  Speak without first being recognized by the chair; 
                  (2)  Interrupt anyone who has the floor; 
                  (3)  Use profanity during the public portion of any meeting; 
                  (4)  Refuse to yield the floor, or argue with the chair, if he is ruled out of order by the chair; 
                  (5)  Make disparaging remarks about any person's character during the public portion of any meeting. By way of example, it would be permissible to say "I don't believe that" or "I cannot accept that," but it is improper to say "He's a liar," or "He can't be trusted." Remarks should be limited to the subject under discussion, and shall not address the character of the person involved. Nothing herein shall limit or restrict the free and open debate of these matters in executive or closed session. 
                  (6)  Confront anyone about a prior statement in an accusatory manner during the public portion of any meeting. By way of example, it would be permissible to ask someone if something different had been said on a prior occasion, and the question should be phrased "Did you tell me ____________ ?" or "Do you remember telling me ____________ ?" It is impermissible to say "Didn't you tell me ____________ ?" or "Why did you tell me ____________ before the meeting?" The purpose of the public portion of a commissioner's meeting is to allow each commissioner, county representative and members of the public to state their positions in an orderly fashion; it is not a trial where persons are to be cross examined, interrogated, belittled or held out for public ridicule or embarrassment. Nothing herein shall limit or restrict the free and open debate of these matters in executive or closed session. 
                  (7)  State during the public portion of any meeting that a county employee has not done his or her job, or has not done his or her job properly. By way of example, it would be permissible to ask if a county employee did or did not do a specific task, but the question must be phrased in such a way that a simple "yes" or "no" answer is all that is requested. It would also be permissible to state or comment that a job was not done, or that it was not done correctly, so long as the person responsible is not singled out for blame; remarks concerning the subject or job performance are proper but negative references to the person responsible are not. It is not proper to accuse county employees of not doing their jobs, or doing them improperly, during the public portion of the meetings. County employees shall not be placed in the position of responding to accusations of wrongdoing by a commissioner during the public portion of a meeting (unless the meeting has been called as a hearing for the express purpose of determining disciplinary action), nor shall their integrity or competency be challenged by a commissioner during the public portion of any meeting. Nothing herein shall limit or restrict the free and open debate or these matters in executive closed session. 
                  (8)  Represent their personal position or beliefs as being the position or beliefs of the board as a whole. By way of example, unless and until a majority vote has been obtained on a specific issue, a commissioner shall not state that the board will or will not do something, nor shall a commissioner state what the board's vote will be on an issue. No single commissioner can speak on behalf of the board unless specifically authorized by majority vote to do so. 
                  (9)  Refuse to recognize the validity of action approved by a majority vote of the board. By way of example, a commissioner is free to state that he does not agree with the majority vote, or that he would like to see the majority reconsider its action and vote a different way. However, a commissioner shall not refuse to sign any ordinance, resolution, contract or other legal document because he did not vote for the action taken. The minutes shall reflect his opposition to the majority's decision, but he shall not be authorized to withhold his signature on the basis that he did not vote for the action taken. 
                  (10)  Divulge the subject matter of any confidential information, legal advice or strategy discussions revealed during an executive session called for the purpose of discussing actual or potential litigation against the county or any county employee. There may be occasions when a commissioner will be asked to make specific commitment to this rule in connection with a particular case. If a commissioner is unwilling to pledge his commitment to the other members of the board, he shall be excluded from participating in that portion of the executive session. 
                  (Ord. of 1-10-2005, § I) 
                  Sec. 2-44. - Same—Outside of meetings. 
                  A member of the Ware County Board of Commissioners shall not: 
                  (1)  Direct any department head or county employee to do a job or perform a task. All such requests shall be made to the county manager. Once such a request is made, the commissioners shall follow-up with the county manager regarding the performance of the work, not with the department head or county employee whom the commissioner expects to do the job. If the job is not performed to the commissioner's satisfaction, this shall be taken up with the county manager first; if the commissioner is still not satisfied, the matter shall next be discussed with all members of the board of commissioners in executive session, under the exemption to the Open Meetings Act for discussion of employee performance. There shall be no criticism or disparaging remarks made about any county employee in a public meeting unless and until all of these steps have been exhausted. 
                  (2)  Publicly state that he intends to fire or discipline any county employee. No single commissioner has the authority to hire or fire county personnel. 
                  (3)  Reprimand any county employee. If a commissioner believes a county employee should be reprimanded, he shall so inform the county manager. If a commissioner believes the county manager should be reprimanded, he shall notify the other members of the board of commissioners. No single commissioner has the authority to discipline county personnel. 
                  (4)  Use profanity, insulting or demeaning words about a county employee in the presence of that employee, or in the presence of any other county employee. 
                  (5)  Call into question the qualifications or competency of a county employee in the presence of that employee, or in the presence of any other county employee. Concern of this nature shall be addressed in the stages outlined in subsection (1) of this section. 
                  (6)  Demand that the county manager or any department head stop what he or she is doing and immediately attend to the commissioner's business. If the county manager or a department head requests that the commissioner schedule a time to discuss a matter that is mutually convenient to all concerned, the commissioner shall honor that request. 
                  (7)  Promise on behalf of the county or the board of commissioners to undertake any act or to pass any ordinance, resolution, contract or agreement. A single commissioner has no authority to bind the board of commissioners. 
                  (8)  Agree to buy or sell anything of value on behalf of the county without advance approval by a majority vote of the board of commissioners. 
                  (9)  Attempt to negotiate county business with any private party or a representative of another governmental unit without the advance approval of a majority of the board of commissioners. By way of example, it is permissible for a commissioner to discuss county business in general terms with private parties and representatives of other governmental units (unless there is actual or threatened litigation against Ware County by the parties involved). However, a commissioner shall not make any written offers, draft any agreements, edit or revise any proposed agreements or plans or suggest or propose (whether orally or in writing) any specific terms concerning money or services to be provided or received by the county unless that commissioner has received expressed authorization in advance by a majority vote of the board of commissioners. The fact that the subject matter involves property or persons in a commissioner's district is of no consequence, as a commissioner has no additional legal authority over a matter simply because it is in his district. 
                  (10)  Speak to any representatives of the news media on behalf of the county or the board of commissioners without advance approval by majority vote of the board of commissioners. By way of example, a commissioner is free to express his personal views or opinions to anyone. However, a commissioner shall not make a statement in the name of the board of commissioners or in the name of Ware County unless he has been authorized in advance to do so by majority vote of the board of commissioners.

                  Sec. 2-45. - Penalties. 
                  (a)  The board of commissioners shall have the responsibility to police itself and to enforce the ordinance from which this section and sections 2-42—2-44 are derived. Any commissioner shall have the right to bring a suspected violation of the ordinance from which this section and sections 2-42—2-44 are derived to the attention of the full board. Any such accusation may be deliberated upon in executive session, but a vote upon any penalty to be imposed must be taken in open, public session, with all members of the board present. If the board determines by majority vote that a violation of the ordinance from which this section and sections 2-42—2-44 are derived has occurred, the board shall have the authority to impose one or more of the following penalties upon the offending commissioner: 
                  (1)  A verbal censure that shall be noted in the minutes without further elaboration; 
                  (2)  A written censure, to be made a part of the minutes, specifically outlining the facts underlying the violation; 
                  (3)  Removal of the commissioner from membership on any committee, association or group in which the offending commissioner is involved in his capacity as Ware County commissioner; removal shall take place by the delivery of a letter, signed by the board of commissioners, to the head of such committee, association or group, stating that the offending commissioner is no longer authorized to represent Ware County. The sanction shall last for a period of up to one year from the date of the offense. 
                  (4)  A fine, not to exceed $500.00 per offense, which shall be paid by the offending commissioner to the general fund of Ware County, Georgia, within ten days of the board's vote establishing a violation; if the offending commissioner fails to make this payment within the time specified herein, the amount of the penalty shall be withheld from the offending commissioner's compensation as a commissioner. 
                  (b)  The decision of the Ware County Board of Commissioners on any question concerning a violation of the ordinance from which this section and sections 2-42—2-44 are derived, or the penalty imposed, shall be final, it being the express intent of all the commissioners to govern themselves, and not to abdicate this responsibility to any other person or entity.

                  All called or special meetings will follow the following procedure: 
                  (1)  The members shall be entitled to at least three days written notice of the time, place and hour of such meeting or they may waive such notice. Provided however, that in cases of emergency or great importance, the chair may call special or called meetings by telephone or personal contact provided that all members of the board of commissioners shall have actually been notified, and all members of said board shall have signed a waiver of written notice before such meeting might be held. 
                  (2)  A called or special meeting may be held at any time when three members of the said board of commissioners shall have presented in writing a request for a called or special meeting stating the purpose of such meeting in writing, and said request shall be filed with the clerk of the board of commissioners. In this event it shall be the duty of the clerk to notify in writing all members of the board, giving them at least ten days' notice of the called meeting in writing stating the purpose of such meeting and that it had been requested in writing by three members of the board. Any meeting had in such manner shall in all instances be an official called meeting. Such meeting will have authority as an official meeting and any business to be transacted at such meeting subject to this article shall require a majority vote of at least three members.

                  Called meetings by the vice-chair may be had in any situation during the physical absence of the chair, provided proper written notice is given to all members of the board in accordance with this article and subject to the same terms as are required for called meetings by the chair, and any such meetings so called must reflect the unanimous approval and consent of all members of the board present that the meeting was necessary and that the chair was in fact physically absent from the county. Waiver of such notice in writing by all the remaining members of the board will suffice in lieu of prior written notice. In such event, said called meeting would then have the power to transact business in all respects as an official meeting of said board to the same extent as if the meeting had been called by the chair and he had been physically present and presided over said meeting.

Concurrent with the submission of the proposed amendment to the department, the local governing body shall submit in writing the legislative findings of the governing body and such other documentation as the local governing body deems helpful in justifying the proposed amendment. The department shall review and comment on a proposed amendment. Such comment shall be in writing and shall be sent to the submitting local government with a recommendation: 
                  a.  That the proposed local amendment should not be adopted, due to the lack of sufficient evidence to show that such proposed local amendment would be as stringent as the state minimum standard codes and the lack of sufficient evidence to show that local climatic, geologic, topographic or public safety factors require such an amendment; 
                  b.  That the proposed local amendment should be adopted, due to a preponderance of evidence that such proposed local amendment would be as stringent as the state minimum standard codes and a preponderance of the evidence that the local climatic, geologic, topographic or public safety factors require such an amendment; or

                  (4)  No local amendment shall become effective until the local governing body has caused a copy of the adopted amendment to be filed with the department. A copy of an amendment shall be deemed to have been filed with the department when it has been placed in the United States mail, return receipt requested. 
                  (5)  Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to require approval by the department before a local amendment shall become effective. 
                  (6)  At the time of issuing a building permit, the issuing county or municipality shall notify the holder of the permit of any local amendments to the state minimum standard codes which are in effect for that county or municipality and that any such amendments are on file with the department. A county or municipality may satisfy this notice requirement by posting or providing a summary of the topic of such local amendment or amendments and the address and telephone number of the department. 
                  (7)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (1)c. of this section, building related codes or ordinances dealing with the subjects of historic preservation, high-rise construction or architectural design standards for which a state minimum standard code does not exist may be adopted by a local jurisdiction following review by the department. The department's review shall be limited to a determination that the proposed code or ordinance is consistent with the approved state minimum standard codes when common elements exist and is not less restrictive than the requirement of said codes.

The temporary permit shall not exceed six months in duration. In the case of a continuing hardship, and in the discretion of the board or its designee, the permit may be extended for a period of up to an additional six months.

Each day any such entity does business in the unincorporated areas of the county without complying with this ordinance [from which this section derives] constitutes a separate offense. 
                  (b)  The cost of business license fees in a declared emergency or disaster is fixed at $50.00 per annum. License is nontransferable. The cost of the emergency building permit shall be equal to the cost for a building permit under existing regulations. The permit shall only be authorized for repairs.

The actual and final amount of tax levied for business transacted in the current calendar year shall be paid in accordance with a final return to be made after the end of the year, in accordance with the procedure set forth here. 
                  (b)  The owner, proprietor, manager, or secretary officer of the business subject to said occupation tax of the current calendar year shall, at the end of the preceding year, and on or before April 1 of the current calendar year, file with the county planning and codes department director, on a form furnished by said officer, a signed return setting forth the amount of gross receipts of such business for the entire preceding calendar year. This return will be used to determine the final tax for the calendar year just completed and as an estimate of the gross receipts and occupation tax for the current year. 
                  (c)  Where a business subject to the occupation tax for the calendar year has been conducted for only a part of the preceding year, the amount of gross receipts for such part shall be reported in said return. Said return shall also show a figure putting the receipts for such part of a year on an annual basis with the part-year receipts bearing the same ratio to the whole-year gross receipts as the part year bears to the whole year. Said figure shall be used as the estimate of the gross receipts of the business for the current calendar year in establishing the business tax liability.

                  (a)  On or before April 1 of each year, the owner, proprietor, manager or executive officer of the business liable for said occupation tax levied for the year shall file with the county planning and codes department director, on a form furnished by the county planning and codes department director, a signed return setting forth the actual amount of the gross receipts of such business during the preceding calendar year. 
                  (b)  If the amount of the occupation tax for the preceding year based on the return provided for in this section and on the rate of said tax provided for in this article, is less than the amount of occupation tax theretofore paid by said business based on the estimate filed pursuant to section 42-44 hereof, the difference in said amount shall be due and payable by the taxpayer to Ware County on April 1 of the current year and delinquent if not paid on or before said date. 
                  (c)  If the amount of the occupation tax for the preceding year based on the return provided for in this section and on the rate of said tax provided for in this article, exceeds the amount of occupation tax theretofore paid by said business based on the estimate filed pursuant to section 42-44 hereof, the difference in said amount shall be refundable by Ware County to the taxpayer; or, if said business continues to be conducted in Ware County during the current year, such difference in amount may be credited by Ware County on the amount of occupation tax to be paid to Ware County by said business for the current year. This election is to be taken by the county.

All contents of said return shall be confidential and open only to the officials, employees, agents or clerks of the county using said returns for the purpose of this occupation tax levy and the collection of the tax. Independent auditors or bookkeepers employed by the county shall be classed as "employees." Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the publication by Ware County officials of statistics, so classified as to prevent the identification of particular reports or returns and items thereof; or the inspection of the records by duly qualified employees of the tax departments of the state, the United States, and other local governments.

The county planning and codes department director shall have the right to inspect the books or records for the business of which the return was made in Ware County, and upon demand of the county planning and codes department director such books or records shall be submitted for inspection by a representative of the county within 30 days. Failure of submission of such books or records within 30 days shall be grounds for revocation of the tax registration currently existing to do business in Ware County. Adequate records shall be kept in Ware County, for examination by the county planning and codes department director at that officer's discretion. If, after examination of the books or records, it is determined that a deficiency occurs as a result of underreporting, a penalty of 125 percent of the prime interest rate times the amount deficient will be assessed for the period delinquent. For purposes of this section, the prime interest rate shall be that which is published by The Wall Street Journal on the first business day of the year in which the underreporting is identified.

No new business tax registration shall be granted by Ware County for the operation of a business for which any part of the occupation tax herein provided for is at that time unpaid, or to an individual, firm, or corporation who has failed to submit adequate records as requested by the county planning and codes department director in accordance with provisions found in section 42-45.

                  Any person, their managers, agents or employees, who do business in Ware County after the registration for said business has been revoked as above, hereby required to make occupation tax returns, and who fail to make said returns within the time and in the manner herein provided, who refuse to amend such returns so as to set forth the truth, or who shall make false returns; and any persons, their managers, agents or employees, who refuse to permit an inspection of books in their charge when the officers, agents, employees or representatives of Ware County request such inspection, during business hours, for the purpose of determining the accuracy of the returns herein provided for, shall be subject to penalties provided herein. In the case of those practitioners where the local government cannot suspend the right of the petitioner to conduct business, the imposition of civil penalties shall be permitted and pursued by the local government in the case of delinquent occupation tax.

                  In addition to the other remedies herein provided for the collection of the occupation tax herein levied, the county planning and codes department director, upon any tax or installment of said tax becoming delinquent and remaining unpaid, shall issue execution for the correct amount of said tax against persons, partnership or corporation liable for said tax, which said execution shall bear interest at the rate of 12 percent per annum from the date when such tax or installment becomes delinquent, and the lien shall cover the property (in the County of Ware) of the person, partnership or corporation liable for said tax, all as provided by law. The lien of said occupation tax shall become fixed on and date from the time when such tax or any installment thereof becomes delinquent. The execution shall be levied by the Ware County Planning and Codes Director in the county planning and codes department upon the property of the defendant located in said jurisdiction, and sufficient property shall be advertised and sold to pay the amount of said execution, with interest and costs. All other proceedings in relation thereto shall be had as is provided by ordinance and law, and the defendant in said execution shall have rights of defense, by affidavit of illegality and otherwise, which are provided by the applicable laws in regard to tax executions. When a nulla bona entry has been entered by proper authority upon an execution issued by the county planning and codes department director against any person defaulting on the occupation tax, the person against whom entry was made shall not be allowed or entitled to have or collect any fees or charges whatsoever for services rendered after the entry of a nulla bona. If, at any time after the entry of nulla bona has been made, the person against whom the execution issues pays the tax in full together with all interest and costs accrued on the tax, the person may collect any fees and charges due him or her as though he or she had never defaulted in the payment of the taxes.

Said amendment may increase or lower the amounts and tax rates of any occupation and may change the classification thereof. The payment of any occupation tax provided for shall not be construed as prohibiting the levy or collection by the jurisdiction of additional occupation taxes upon the same person, property or business.

                  (a)  It shall be the duty of the Clerk of Ware County to issue a license contemplated by this article after an application has been filed and verification has been received that all applicable requirements of federal, state and/or county statutes and/or ordinances have been met, and payment of the prescribed occupational tax or fee is received. Compliance with state and county statutes and ordinances shall specifically include a requirement that the applicant or business of the applicant is not delinquent in the payment of any personal or real property taxes. For purposes of this section, any tax that has been paid, formally appealed to the proper authorities, or is being paid pursuant to a plan authorized and approved by the appropriate tax or revenue commissioner shall not be deemed delinquent. 
                  (b)  The board of commissioners shall establish a uniform procedure for notice and a hearing for any taxpayer whose occupational license it proposes to suspend, or withhold issuance of prior to imposing a suspension or withholding of the occupational license. 
                  (c)  Any previously adopted Ordinance or Resolution of Ware County which is in conflict with this section is hereby repealed, and the provisions of this section shall control.

                  Secs. 42-62—42-76. - Reserved. 
                  ARTICLE III. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS 

                  Sec. 42-77. - Purpose and findings. 
                  (a)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this ordinance to regulate sexually oriented businesses and related activities to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the County, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the County. The provisions of this ordinance have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this ordinance to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. 2 Neither is it the intent nor effect of this ordinance to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials. 
                  Note— The United States Supreme Court has held that nonobscene, sexually explicit materials and entertainment are protected by the First Amendment. Notwithstanding, the Court has stated that government may regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to eliminate or control the adverse secondary effects caused by these businesses. These adverse secondary effects include, but are not limited to, crime, sexually transmitted diseases, urban blight, declining property values, and lower quality of life. Enactment of legislation regulating sexually oriented businesses must be supported by factual findings of adverse secondary effects made by the enacting body. 
                  Case Law annotation— Courts normally review content-based restrictions on speech under "strict scrutiny" review, and require government to show a "compelling state interest" for the restriction. However, the Supreme Court has stated that, because restrictions on sexually explicit speech are justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech, the proper level of review is whether the regulation is narrowly tailored to a substantial government interest. See County of Renton v. Playtime Theaters , 475 U.S. 41, 48 (1986); United States v. O'rien , 391 U.S. 367, 377 (1968). Here, the substantial government interest is combating adverse secondary effects. If the ordinance targeted the speech itself, the test would be strict scrutiny, a burden almost impossible to meet. 
                  (b)  Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the county commission, and on findings incorporated in the cases of County of Lots Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc. , 535 U.S. 425 (2002); County of Erie v. Pap's A.M. , 529 U.S. 277 (2000); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc. , 501 U.S. 560 (1991); County of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc. , 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Arcara v. Cloud Books, Inc. , 478 U.S. 697, (1986); Iacobucci v. County of Newport, Ky , 479 U.S. 92 (1986); Young v. American Mini Theatres , 427 U.S. 50 (1976); California v. LaRue , 409 U.S. 109 (1972); United States v. O'Brien , 391 U.S. 367 (1968); DLS, Inc. v. County of Chattanooga , 107 F.3d 403 (6th Cir.1997); Key, Inc. v. Kitsap County , 793 F.2d 1053 (9th Cir.1986); Hang On, Inc. v. County of Arlington , 65 F.3d 1248 (5th Cir.1995); South Florida Free Beaches, Inc. v. County of Miami , 734 F.2d 608 (11th Cir.1984); and N.W. Enterprises v. County of Houston , 27 F.Supp. 2d 754 (S.D. Tex. 1998)), as well as studies conducted in other cities including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma County, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont, Texas; and findings reported in the Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986), the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group On the Regulation Of Sexually Oriented Business (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), and statistics obtained from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the county commission finds that: 
                  Case Law annotation— Findings may be supported by studies conducted by other cities, by the county's own study, or by findings of a court. See, e.g., County of Erie v. Pap's A.M. , 529 U.S. 277, 296-97 (2000); SOB, Inc. v. County of Benton , 317 F.3d 856, 862-64 (8th Cir. 2003). Nevertheless, it is important that the legislating body state the findings on the record prior to enactment, and note that the purpose of the ordinance is to combat adverse secondary effects. See, e.g., Peek-a-Boo Lounge of Bradenton, Inc. v. Manatee County, Florida , No. 02-12281 (11 th Cir. July 15, 2003); Lakeland Lounge v. Jackson, 973 F.2d 1255, 1259 (5 th Cir. 1992) (where (1) the drafters of the ordinance did rely upon studies of secondary effects, (2) a majority of the Commission members did receive some information about the secondary effects during an open hearing of the planning board, and (3) nothing in the record otherwise suggests impermissible motives on the part of the Commission members, the language of the preamble shows the county commission's awareness of the studies upon which the planning staff relied when framing the ordinance and reflects that a reasonable legislature with constitutional motives could have enacted the ordinance). 
                  Case Law annotation— The Fifth Circuit has held that the studies cited in our model ordinance may be insufficient to demonstrate a factual basis for zoning regulation targeting materials for off-site viewing. See Encore Videos, Inc. v. County of San Antonio , 330 F.3d 288, 294-295 (5 th Cir. 2003). The Tenth Circuit, however, has expressly held that certain of the land use studies cited in our model ordinance are sufficient to establish the necessary factual basis for zoning regulations for both on-site and off-site viewing. See ZJ Gifts v. County of Aurora , 136 F.3d 683, 687 (10 th Cir. 1998) See also id. , n.1 (citing land use studies of Garden Grove, California; Austin, Texas; Oklahoma County, Oklahoma; Indianapolis, Indiana; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Whittier, California; and Amarillo, Texas). 
                  (1)  Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary, unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. 
                  (2)  Crime statistics show that all types of crimes, especially sex-related crimes, occur with more frequency in neighborhoods where sexually oriented businesses are located. See, e.g., Studies of the cities of Phoenix, Arizona; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Austin, Texas. 
                  (3)  Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows. See, e.g., California v. LaRue , 409 U.S. 109, 111 (1972); See also Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377. 
                  (4)  Offering and providing such booths and/or cubicles encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. See, e.g., Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 376-77. 
                  (5)  Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses, for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses. See, e.g., Arcara v. Cloud Books, Inc. , 478 U.S. 697, 698 (1986); see also Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 376-77. 
                  (6)  At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections, and shigella infections. See, e.g., Study of Fort Meyers, Florida. 
                  (7)  As of June, 2001, the total number of reported cases of AIDS in the United States caused by the immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was 793,025. See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at www.cdc.gov. 
                  (8)  As of December 31, 2004, there have been 28,044 reported cases of AIDS in the State of Georgia. (See statistics of Southeast Georgia Health Unit). 
                  (9)  The total number of cases of genital chlamydia trachomatis infections in the United States reported in 2000 was 702,093, a six percent increase over the year 1999. See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at www.cdc.gov. 
                  (10)  The total number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the United States reported during the 12-year period 1996-2000 was 212,672. See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at www.cdc.gov. 
                  (11)  The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a high level, with a total of 1,730,911 cases reported during the period 1996-2000. See, e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at www.cdc.gov. 
                  (12)  The surgeon general of the United States in his report of October 22, 1986, advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug use, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn. 
                  (13)  According to the best scientific evidence available, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. See, e.g., Findings of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at www.cdc.gov. 
                  (14)  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. See, e.g., Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377. 
                  (15)  Numerous studies and reports have determined that bodily fluids, including semen and urine, are found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult" oriented films. See, e.g., Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377. 
                  (16)  Nude dancing in adult establishments encourages prostitution, increases sexual assaults, and attracts other criminal activity. See, e.g., Barnes v. Glen Theatre , 501 U.S. 560, 583 (1991). 
                  (17)  Nude dancing in adult establishments increases the likelihood of drug-dealing and drug use. See, e.g., Kev, Inc. v. Kitsap County , 793 F.2d 1053, 1056 (9th Cir.1986). 
                  (18)  Alcohol consumption in adult establishments increases the likelihood of crime, illegal drug use, and illegal sexual activity, and encourages undesirable behavior that is not in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare. See, e.g., Artistic Entertainment, Inc. v. County of Warner Robins , 223 F.3d 1306, 1309 (11 th Cir.2000); Sammy's Ltd. v. County of Mobile , 140 F.3d 993, 996 (11 th Cir.1998), cent. denied, 529 U.S. 1052, 146 L. Ed. 2d 459, 120 S. Ct. 1553 (2000). 
                  (19)  The findings noted in subsections (b)(1)—(18) of this section raise substantial governmental concerns. 
                  (20)  Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
                  (21)  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexually oriented businesses. Further, such licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the county. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
                  (22)  Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on the premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult establishments. 
                  (23)  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and criminal activity. 
                  (24)  It is desirable, in the prevention of crime and the spread of communicable diseases, to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct this article is designed to prevent, or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity. 
                  (25)  The fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sex-related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention to this article. 
                  (26)  The barring of such individuals from operation or employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of five years for a previous felony conviction serves as a deterrent to further criminal conduct, and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. 
                  (27)  The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of this county will be promoted by enactment of the ordinance from which this article is derived. 
                  (28)  When more than one sexually oriented business use occupies the same location or business address, the secondary effects caused by such businesses are increased. Secondary effects are eliminated or controlled to a greater degree when only a single sexually oriented business use is allowed to occupy the same location.

                  Sec. 58-4. - Minimum requirements for erosion and sedimentation control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land disturbing activities which are not excluded by this chapter shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion and sedimentation control plans. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sedimentation pollution during all stages of any land disturbing activity. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMP's. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsection (a) and (b) of this section shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(2) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f). As used in this subsection(b)(1), the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed to control soil erosion and sediment for all rainfall events up to and including a 25-year, 24-hour rainfall event. 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or by the division or of any general permit for construction activities issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or by the division or of any general permit for construction activities issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (c)  Best management practices required. The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this chapter for the purpose of governing land disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" published by the state soil and water conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control measures shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of this chapter; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping surface of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible; provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2); 
                  (15)  Land disturbing activities shall not be conducted within 25 feet of the banks of any state waters, as measured from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented; provided, however, that buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to Part 6 of Article 5 of Chapter 5 of this title, the "Metropolitan River Protection Act," O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq., shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection; and 
                  (16)  Land disturbing activities shall not be conducted within 100 horizontal feet, as measured from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, of the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of the "Georgia Water Quality Act," O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq., unless a variance for such activity is granted by the director except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. 
                  (d)  Adoption of rules and regulations, etc., to exceed minimum requirements. Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent an issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  Presumption of violation. The fact that the land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this chapter or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Code 1983, § 2-16.3-4) 
                  Sec. 58-5. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  Generally. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall review the general development plans and detailed plans of the issuing authority that affect the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall review the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this chapter, and other ordinances which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the issuing authority. However, the property owner is the only party that can obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the issuing authority without first obtaining a permit from the issuing authority to perform such activity. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the planning director of the county planning department and must include the applicant's erosion and sedimentation control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Soil erosion and sedimentation control plans shall conform to the provisions of section 58-4(b) and (c). Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by five copies of the applicant's soil erosion and sediment control plans. 
                  (3)  A fee in the amount as set by the board of commissioners shall be charged for each application. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 58-4(c)(15) and (16) and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(5)b. of this section, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district.

                  (a)  The county planning director or his designee will periodically inspect the sites of land disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. If through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land disturbing activities, as defined herein, has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this chapter, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. This notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed.

                  (b)  Stop work orders. Upon notice from the issuing authority or its agent, work on any project that is being done contrary to the provisions of this chapter or in a dangerous or unsafe manner, shall be immediately stopped. Such notice shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner of the property, his authorized agent or the person or persons in charge of the activity on the property, and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed. Where an emergency exists, no written notice shall be required. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture.

The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this chapter and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 58-5(b)(5)b of this article. The issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this article, the rules and regulations adopted, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order issued as provided in this article, may be held liable for a sentence of imprisonment not to exceed 60 days in jail or monetary penalty of $2,500.00 per day or both.

                  (a)  Administrative remedies. The suspension, revocation, modification or grant with condition of a permit by the issuing authority upon finding that the holder is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sediment control plan; or that the holder is in violation of permit conditions; or that the holder is in violation of any ordinance; shall entitle the person submitting the plan or holding the permit to a hearing before the county board of commissioners within 15 days after receipt by the issuing authority of written notice of appeal. 
                  (b)  Judicial review. Any person, aggrieved by a decision or order of the issuing authority, after exhausting his administrative remedies, shall have the right to appeal de novo to the Superior Court of Ware County.

                  (a)  Neither the approval of a plan under the provisions of this chapter, nor the compliance with provisions of this chapter shall relieve any person from the responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by law nor impose any liability upon the issuing authority or district for damage to any person or property. 
                  (b)  The fact that a land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this chapter or the terms of the permit.

                  Sec. 78-111. - Towers and antennas conditional uses; generally. 
                  (a)  Applicability. 
                  (1)  District height limitations. The requirements set forth in this article shall govern the location of towers within areas of unincorporated Ware County which are not covered by any other zoning resolution of the governing authority. Other ordinance's height limitations applicable to buildings and structures shall not apply to towers and antennas within unzoned areas of the county. 
                  (2)  Public property. Antennas or towers located on publicly owned property shall be exempt from the requirements of this article, provided a license or lease authorizing such antenna or tower has been approved by the governing authority. 
                  (3)  Amateur radio; receive only antennas. This article shall not govern any tower or the installation of any antenna that is under 70 feet in height and is owned and operated by a federally-licensed amateur radio station operator or is used exclusively for receive-only antennas. 
                  (4)  Grandfathered towers and antennas. Any tower or antenna existing on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall not be required to meet the requirements of the ordinance from which this article is derived, other than the requirements of subsection (b)(5) and (6) of this section. Any such towers or antennas that fail to meet the requirements of this article shall be referred to in this article as "grandfathered towers" or "grandfathered antennas." 
                  (b)  General guidelines and requirements. 
                  (1)  Purpose; goals. The purpose of this article is to establish guidelines for the siting of towers and antennas. The goals of this article are to: 
                  a.  Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively and efficiently. 
                  b.  Encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sites. 
                  c.  Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal. 
                  d.  Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas. 
                  e.  Discourage, specifically, the location of towers in residential areas and, generally, the proliferation of towers throughout the community. 
                  (2)  Principal or accessory use. Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use or an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot. The dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots. 
                  (3)  Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for an administrative approval or a special use permit shall provide the planning and codes department with an inventory of its existing towers, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower. The planning and codes department may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative appeals or special use permits under this article or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the governing authority. 
                  (4)  Aesthetic; lighting. The guidelines set forth in this section shall govern the location of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this article; provided, however, that the governing authority may waive these requirements if, in its sole discretion, it determines that the goals of this article are better served thereby. 
                  a.  Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable regulatory agencies, be painted sky blue or gray, to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  b.  At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
                  c.  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
                  d.  Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the governing authority may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. 
                  (5)  Federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government or state government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this article shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations. Failure to bring tower and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. 
                  (6)  Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable county building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the chief codes official concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance with such codes and standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said 30 days, the governing authority may remove such tower at the owner's expense. 
                  (Code 1983, § 2-19-31) 
                  Sec. 78-112. - Administrative review approvals. 
                  (a)  General. 
                  (1)  The chief codes official may administratively approve the conditional uses listed in this section. 
                  (2)  Applicants for administrative approval shall apply to the chief codes official, providing the information set forth in section 78-113(b)—(d). 
                  (3)  All such use shall comply with section 78-111(b)(4)—(6) and all other applicable resolutions, and prior to the installation of any antenna or tower pursuant to this section, the owner of such antenna or tower shall send written notice to the building department, which notice shall include the location, size and configuration of such antenna or tower. 
                  (4)  The chief codes official shall respond to each such application within 30 days of receiving it by either approving the application, denying the application, or requesting further information from the applicant. If the chief codes official fails to respond to the applicant within said 30 days, then the application shall be deemed to be approved. 
                  (5)  In connection with any such administrative approval, the chief codes official may, in order to encourage shared use, administratively waive any setback requirements by up to 50 percent. 
                  (b)  Specific administratively approved uses. The following conditional uses may be approved by the chief codes official after conducting an administrative review: 
                  (1)  Installing an antenna on an existing structure other than a tower (such as a building, sign, light pole, water tower or other free standing nonresidential structure), as long as such addition does not add more than 20 feet to the height of the existing structure. 
                  (2)  Installing an antenna on an existing tower, including a grandfathered tower and further including the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with said antenna, so long as the addition of said antenna adds no more than 20 feet to the height of said existing tower. 
                  (Code 1983, § 2-19-32) 
                  Sec. 78-113. - Conditional use permit approvals. 
                  (a)  General. The following provisions shall govern the issuance of conditional use permits, not administratively approved. 
                  (1)  If the tower or antenna is not permitted to be approved administratively pursuant to this article, then a conditional use permit shall be required for the construction of a tower or the placement of an antenna in this area. 
                  (2)  Any information of an engineering nature that the applicant submits, whether civil, mechanical, electrical, or radio-frequency, shall be certified by a qualified professional engineer. 
                  (b)  Site-plan. Applicants requesting a conditional use permit under this section shall submit a scaled elevation view and supporting drawings and a scaled site plan, showing the location and dimensions of all improvements, including information concerning topography, radio-frequency coverage, tower height requirements, setbacks, drives, parking, fencing, landscaping and other information necessary to assess compliance with this article. 
                  (c)  Factors considered in granting conditional use permits. The chief codes official shall consider the following factors in determining whether to issue a conditional use permit, although such official may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one or more of these criteria, if, in the sole discretion of such official, the goals of this article are better served thereby: 
                  (1)  Height of the proposed tower; 
                  (2)  Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential district boundaries; 
                  (3)  Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties; 
                  (4)  Surrounding topography; 
                  (5)  Surrounding tree coverage and foliage; 
                  (6)  Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness; and 
                  (7)  Availability of suitable existing towers and other structures as discussed in subsection (d) of this section. 
                  (d)  Availability of suitable existing towers or other structures. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the chief codes official that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may consist of the following: 
                  (1)  No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet the applicant's engineering requirements; 
                  (2)  Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements; 
                  (3)  Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment; 
                  (4)  Applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures; 
                  (5)  The fees or costs required to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed unreasonable; 
                  (6)  Property owners of existing towers or structure are unwilling to accommodate reasonably the applicant's needs; 
                  (7)  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
                  (e)  Setbacks and separation. The following setbacks and separation requirements shall apply to all towers and antennas for which a conditional use permit is required; provided, however, that the chief code official may, in its sole discretion, reduce the standard setbacks and separation requirements if the goals of this article would be better served thereby. 
                  (1)  Towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower plus 50 feet from any offsite residential structures. 
                  (2)  Towers, guys, and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum district yard setback requirements (where zoning applies). 
                  (3)  Towers over 70 feet in height shall not be located within one quarter of a mile from any existing tower that is over 70 feet height. 
                  (f)  Security fencing and landscaping. Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anticlimbing device. Such fence shall have a gate at least ten feet wide to allow access by emergency vehicles. 
                  (1)  Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from adjacent residential property. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least four feet wide and eight feet high outside the perimeter of the compound. 
                  (2)  In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived altogether. 
                  (3)  Existing mature growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter may be a sufficient buffer.
