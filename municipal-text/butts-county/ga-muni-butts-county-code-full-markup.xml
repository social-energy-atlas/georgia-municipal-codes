PREFACE

        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a complete codification of the general and permanent ordinances of Butts County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances and resolutions adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance or resolution included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  This 2012 republication includes amendatory legislation through Ord. of 6-11-2012, adopted June 11, 2012, and was accomplished under the supervision of Howard George, Editor. The publisher is most grateful to Christy Lawson, County Zoning Administrator, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Index 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

                  Section 2. All ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted on or before March 16, 1998, and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein, are repealed. 
                  Section 3. The repeal provided for in section 2 hereof shall not be construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance that is repealed by this ordinance. 
                  Section 4.

Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any Code section, whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the county may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief and revocation of licenses or permits. 
                  Section 5. Additions or amendments to the Code when passed in the form as to indicate the intention of the board of commissioners to make the same a part of the Code shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments. 
                  Section 6. Ordinances adopted after March 16, 1998, that amend or refer to ordinances that have been codified in the Code shall be construed as if they amend or refer to like provisions of the Code.

                  SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
                  The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code and are considered "Includes." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code and are considered "Omits." 
                  In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

                  Editor's note—Printed in this division is 1968 Ga. Laws, page 1614, as adopted by the Georgia General Assembly, which amended the state constitution by creating the Butts County Industrial Development Authority. Such local constitutional amendment was continued in force and effect by 1986 Ga. Laws, page 3848. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original act.

                  Sec. 1. - Amendment of constitution. 
                  Article VII, Section VII, Paragraph V of the Constitution is hereby amended by adding at the end thereof the following: 
                  Sec. A. - Created. 
                  There is hereby created a body corporate and politic in Butts County, to be known as the Butts County Industrial Development Authority, which shall be an instrumentality of Butts County and a public corporation and which in this amendment is hereafter referred to as the 'Authority.' 
                  Sec. B. - Members. 
                  The Authority shall consist of five members who shall be appointed by the Board of Commissioners of Roads and Revenues of Butts County, and they shall serve for a term of five years. Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term by the said Board of County Commissioners. A majority of the members shall constitute a quorum and a majority may act for the Authority in any matter. No vacancy shall impair the power of the Authority to act. 
                  Sec. C. - Property.

                  (2)	To borrow money, to issue notes, bonds and revenue certificates, to execute trust agreements or indentures, and to sell, convey, mortgage, pledge and assign any and all of its funds, property and income as security therefor; 
                  (3)	To contract with political subdivisions of the State of Georgia and with private persons and corporations and to sue and be sued in its corporate name; 
                  (4)	To have and exercise usual powers of private corporation except such as are inconsistent with this amendment, including the power to appoint and hire officers, agents and employees and to provide their compensation and duties, which officers and agents may or may not be members of the Authority, and the power to adopt and amend a corporate seal and bylaws and regulations for the conduct and management of the Authority; 
                  (5)	To encourage and promote the expansion and development of industrial and commercial facilities in Butts County so as to relieve insofar as possible unemployment within its boundaries, and to that end to acquire by purchase or gift any building or structure within the limits of Butts County, suitable for and intended for use as a factory, mill, shop, processing plant, assembly plant, or fabricating plant, including all necessary and appurtenant lands and appurtenances thereto, and all necessary or useful furnishing, machinery and equipment. Such acquisition may be through the acquisition of land and the construction thereon of a building, including the demolition of existing structures, or through the acquisition of an existing building and the remodeling, renovating, reconstructing, furnishing and equipping of such building; 
                  (6)	No building acquired hereunder shall be operated by the Authority but shall be leased or sold to one or more persons, firms or corporations. If sold, the purchase price may be paid at one time or in installments falling due in not more than thirty (30) years from the date of transfer of possession. The lessee or purchaser shall be required to pay all costs of operating and maintaining the building or buildings and to pay rentals or installments sufficient, together with other revenues which may be pledged for the purpose, to retire all bonds, both principal and interest, and to pay all other expenses which the Authority may have incurred in connection with the undertaking; 
                  (7)	To accumulate its funds from year to year and to invest accumulated funds in any manner that public funds of the State of Georgia or any of its political subdivisions may be invested;

                  Sec. G. - Bonds—Generally. 
                  In order to finance any undertaking within the scope of its power or to refund any bonds then outstanding, the Authority is hereby authorized to issue bonds bearing rate or rates of interest and maturing at the years and amounts determined by the Authority and the procedure of validation, issuance and delivery shall be in all respects in accordance with the Revenue Bond Law (1937 Ga.

Supp. Chapter 87-8, as if said obligations had been originally authorized to be issued thereunder; provided, however, that any property, real or personal, of the Authority may be pledged, mortgaged, conveyed, assigned, hypothecated or otherwise encumbered as security for any lawful debt of the Authority. The Authority may execute any trust agreement or indenture not in conflict with the provisions of this amendment to provide security for any bonds issued as provided herein, and such trust agreement or indenture may provide for foreclosure or forced sale of any property of the Authority upon default on such bonds either in payment of principal or interest or under any term or condition under which such bonds are issued. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to create a right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of Butts County to pay any such bonds or the interest thereon nor to enforce payment thereof against any property of Butts County. 
                  Sec. H. - Same—Additional. 
                  The Authority may authorize additional bonds, for extensions and permanent improvements to any industrial building acquired hereunder, to be placed in escrow and to be negotiated from time to time as proceeds for that purpose may become necessary. Bonds so placed in escrow shall, when sold and delivered, have such standing with the bonds of the same issue as may be provided in the authorizing proceedings. 
                  Sec. I. - Same—Refunding; exceptions. 
                  No bonds except refunding bonds shall be issued hereunder unless the Authority shall have found and declared that: 
                  (1)	The undertaking for which the bonds are to be issued will increase employment in Butts County; 
                  (2)	The lessee or purchaser of the building or buildings involved will not by virtue of establishing operations in said county, reduce the number of employees employed by said lessee or purchaser elsewhere in the State of Georgia. 
                  Sec. J. - Gifts and contributions. 
                  No moneys derived by the Authority from any source other than gifts and contributions from private individuals, firms, or corporations shall at any time be used for entertainment, or other promotional expenses. 
                  Sec. K. - Property. 
                  Should said Authority for any reason be dissolved, title to all property of every kind and nature, real and personal, held by the Authority at the time of such dissolution shall revert to Butts County subject to any mortgages, liens, leases or other encumbrances outstanding against or in respect to said property at that time. 
                  Sec. L. - Intent. 
                  This amendment is adopted for the purpose of promoting and expanding for the public good and welfare industry and trade within Butts County and reducing unemployment to the greatest extent possible, and this amendment and any law enacted with reference to the Authority shall be liberally construed for the accomplishment of these purposes. 
                  Sec. M. - Effective date. 
                  This amendment shall be effective immediately upon proclamation of its ratification by the Governor and the first members of the Authority shall be appointed within thirty (30) days after such proclamation.

                  The General Assembly may by law further define and prescribe the powers and duties of the Authority and the exercise thereof, and may enlarge and restrict the same, and may likewise further regulate the management and conduct of the Authority. The Authority shall be an instrumentality of Butts County and the scope of its operations shall be limited to the territory embraced within said County. The General Assembly shall not extend the jurisdiction of the Authority nor the scope of its operations beyond such limits.

                  In the discretion of the authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank inside or outside the state having the powers of a trust company. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, charges, revenues, and earnings to be received by the authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair, and insurance of the project, and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys; may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority and shall be satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor; may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depositary of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers; and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depositary and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of private corporations. In addition, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the project affected by such indenture.

                  (5)	Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of resolution or ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of resolution material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

                  (d)	The sealed bids shall be opened at a public meeting of the county board of commissioners and read in open session. The county board of commissioners, by majority vote, shall have the authority to sell the property to the highest bidder, or to reject all bids and request new bids. The county board of commissioners shall terminate the proceedings to sell the property if any bid has been opened or tampered with prior to the public meeting. 
                  (e)	As an alternative to paragraphs (c) and (d) above, the county board of commissioners may direct that unserviceable property be sold at public auction. When this process is selected the commissioners may hire a qualified auctioneer to preside over and conduct the sale, and the auctioneer may be paid a reasonable fee or percentage of the total sale for said services. Prior to any public auction taking place, the county administrator or county clerk shall cause a notice to be published in the legal organ of the county, listing the property to be sold, when and where it may be inspected, and the date, time and place of the public auction. 
                  (f)	A county employee, officer or elected official other than a county commissioner and the county administrator shall not be prohibited from submitting a sealed bid or making an offer to purchase unserviceable county property at a public auction, provided the provisions of this section are followed, it being the intent of the county board of commissioners to give all persons the same and equal opportunity to purchase such property. 
                  (g)	This section shall not apply to the sale or disposition of real property, as such dispositions are governed by a separate and distinct provision of Georgia law.

                  All meetings of the board of commissioners shall be held in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 50-14-1 et seq. The public shall at all times be afforded access to all meetings other than executive sessions.

                  Sec. 2-57. - Quorum. 
                  A quorum must be present for conducting meetings of the board. A quorum is a majority of all the members of the board then in office. It is the duty of the chairman to enforce this rule. Any commissioner may raise a point of order directed to the chairman if he believes that a quorum is not present. If, during the course of a meeting, a commissioner leaves and a quorum no longer exists, the meeting cannot continue. If a quorum is not attained within 30 minutes, the meeting will be rescheduled by the chairman with the approval of the commissioners present. 
                  (Res. of 7-3-1995, art. I, § 1.02)
                  Sec. 2-58. - Voting majority. 
                  Passage of a motion shall require the affirmative vote of a majority of commissioners present and voting at a meeting at which a quorum is present. Unless otherwise specified in these procedures, a majority shall mean more than one-half of the commissioners present excluding abstentions. Where a two-thirds majority is specified, a majority vote shall mean at least two-thirds of the commissioners present excluding abstentions (i.e., four of five, three of four, two of three).

                  Sec. 2-59. - Abstentions. 
                  A commissioner shall vote on all motions unless he has a conflict of interest which could prevent him from making a decision in a fair and legal manner. If a conflict of interest does exist, the commissioner shall explain for the record his decision to abstain on any vote. 
                  (Res. of 7-3-1995, art. I, § 1.04)
                  Sec. 2-60. - Chairman. 
                  The board shall select a chairman from the board members at the beginning of each calendar year. The chairman of the board of commissioners is responsible for the orderly conduct of the meeting. In order to fulfill this duty, the chairman must enforce the rules of procedure that are adopted by the board of commissioners. The chairman shall be impartial and conduct the meetings in a fair manner. The chairman, being duly elected as a commissioner representing a district of the county, may introduce or second motions and shall vote on all matters. 
                  (Res. of 7-3-1995, art. I, § 1.05)
                  Sec. 2-61. - Vice-chairman. 
                  The board shall select a vice-chairman from the board members at the beginning of each calendar year. The vice-chairman shall fulfill the duties of the chairman if the chairman is not in attendance. If the chairman and the vice-chairman are absent and a quorum is present, the remaining commissioners shall select a commissioner to serve as temporary chairman of the meeting until either the chairman or vice-chairman is present at the meeting. 
                  (Res. of 7-3-1995, art. I, § 1.06)
                  Sec. 2-62. - Agenda. 
                  The county administrator, with the advice of the chairman and the commissioners, shall prepare an agenda of subjects to be acted on for each meeting. An agenda shall be made available to the commissioners at least one business day before every board meeting. All requests for placement on the agenda must be received by the county administrator at least two business days before the meeting. A new item or subject that requires urgent attention may be added to the agenda during a meeting by a two-thirds vote of the board. A copy of the agenda and a list of those members present shall be made available to the public for inspection within two business days of the adjournment of any meeting. 
                  (Res. of 7-3-1995, art. I, § 1.07)
                  Sec. 2-63. - Consent agenda. 
                  A consent agenda may be prepared by the county administrator for the board to unanimously adopt motions on routine items. Any items of business that are expected to receive unanimous approval and where no debate is expected may be placed on a consent agenda. At the appropriate time of the meeting, the chairman shall read all of the items on the consent agenda. If a commissioner objects to an item being on the consent agenda, the chairman shall move that particular item to the regular agenda. Following the reading of the consent agenda, the chairman will ask for unanimous approval of the items on the consent agenda. If there are no objections, all the items on the consent agenda will be adopted by unanimous consent. 
                  (Res. of 7-3-1995, art. I, § 1.08)
                  Sec. 2-64. - Minutes. 
                  The clerk of the board shall promptly record the minutes for each board meeting. The minutes serve as the official written record of the board meeting and shall be open for public inspection once approved as official by the board but in no case later than immediately following the next regular meeting of the board. The minutes shall specify the names of commissioners present at the meeting, a description of each motion or other proposal made at the meeting, the commissioner who proposed each motion, the commissioner who seconded each motion, and a record of all votes. In the case of a roll call vote, the name of each commissioner voting for or against a proposal shall be recorded. It shall be presumed that a commissioner has voted in the affirmative unless the minutes show otherwise. More detailed information may be included in the minutes at the request of the board. The board must approve the minutes before they can be considered as an official record of the board. A copy of the minutes from the previous meeting shall be distributed to the commissioners at least one business day before the following meeting and shall be signed by each commissioner attending the meeting. The minutes of the previous meetings shall be corrected and approved by the board at the beginning of each regular meeting. A majority vote is required for approval. Conflicts about the content of the minutes shall be decided by majority vote. Upon being approved, the minutes shall be attested to by the clerk of the board of commissioners.

                  Sec. 2-65. - Order of business. 
                  All regular board meetings should follow an established order of business. The order is as follows: 
                  (1)	Call to order
                  (2)	Approval of minutes
                  (3)	Invited guests
                  (4)	Reports from committees and departments
                  (5)	Consent agenda
                  (6)	Old business
                  (7)	New business
                  (8)	Public comments
                  (9)	Adjournment.
                  (Res. of 7-3-1995, art. I, § 1.10)
                  Sec. 2-66. - Decorum. 
                  All commissioners must conduct themselves in a professional and respectful manner. All remarks should be directed to the chairman and not to individual commissioners, staff or citizens in attendance. Personal remarks are inappropriate. A commissioner is not allowed to speak at a meeting until he has been recognized by the chairman. All comments made by a commissioner shall address the motion being discussed. The chairman shall enforce these rules of decorum. If a commissioner believes that a rule has been broken, he can raise a point of order. A second is not required. The chairman can rule on the question or he can allow the board to debate the issues and decide the issue by majority vote. 
                  (Res. of 7-3-1995, art. I, § 1.11)
                  Sec. 2-66a. - Conduct during meetings. 
                  During the public portions of Public Meetings and Public Hearings members of the Butts County Board of Commissioners shall not: 
                  (1)	Speak without first being recognized by the Chair;
                  (2)	Interrupt anyone who has the floor;
                  (3)	Use profanity during the public portion of any meeting;
                  (4)	Refuse to yield the floor, or argue with the Chair, if he is ruled out of order by the Chair; 
                  (5)	Make disparaging remarks about any person's character during the public portion of any meeting. By way of example, it would be permissible to say "I don't believe that" or "I cannot accept that," but it is improper to say "He's a liar," or "He can't be trusted." Remarks should be limited to the subject under discussion, and shall not address the character of the persons involved. Nothing herein shall limit or restrict the free and open debate of these matters in executive or closed session; 
                  (6)	Confront anyone about a prior statement in an accusatory manner during the public portion of any meeting. By way of example, it would be permissible to ask someone if something different had been said on a prior occasion, and the question should be phrased "Did you tell me ____________?" or "Do you remember telling me ____________?" It is impermissible to say "Didn't you tell me ____________," or "Why did you tell me ____________ before the meeting." The purpose of the public portion of a commissioner's meeting is to allow each commissioner, county representatives and members of the public to state their positions in an orderly fashion; it is not a trial where persons are to cross-examined, interrogated, belittled or held out for public ridicule or embarrassment. Nothing herein shall limit or restrict the free and open debate of these matters in executive or closed session; 
                  (7)	State during the public portion of any meeting that a county employee has not done his or her job, or has not done his or her job properly. By way of example, it would be permissible to ask if a county employee did or did not do a specific task, but the question must be phrased in a such a way that a simple "yes" or "no" answer is all that is requested. It would also be permissible to state or comment that a job was not done, or that it was not done correctly, so long as the person responsible is not singled out for blame; remarks concerning the subject of job performance are proper, but negative references to the person responsible are not. It is not proper to accuse county employees of not doing their jobs, or doing them improperly, during the public portions of the meeting. County employees shall not be placed in the position of responding to accusations of wrongdoing by a commissioner during the public portion of a meeting (unless the meeting has been called as a hearing for the express purpose of determining disciplinary action), nor shall their integrity or competency be challenged by a commissioner during the public portion of any meeting. Nothing herein shall limit or restrict the free and open debate of these matters in executive or closed session; 
                  (8)	Represent their personal position or beliefs as being the position or beliefs of the board as a whole. By way of example, unless and until a majority vote has been obtained on a specific issue, a commissioner shall not state that the board will or will not do something, nor shall a commissioner state what the board's vote will be on an issue. No single commissioner can speak on behalf of the board unless specifically authorized by majority vote to do so; 
                  (9)	Refuse to recognize the validity of action approved by majority vote of the board. By way of example, a commissioner is free to state that he does not agree with the majority vote, or that he would like to see the majority reconsider its action and vote a different way. However, a commissioner shall not refuse to sign any ordinance, resolution, contract or other legal document because he did not vote for the action taken. The minutes shall reflect his opposition to the majority's decision, but he shall not be authorized to withhold his signature on the basis that he did not vote for the action taken; 
                  (10)	Divulge the subject matter of any confidential information, legal advice, or strategy discussions revealed during an executive session called for the purpose of discussing actual or potential litigation against the county or any county employee. There may be occasions when a commissioner will be asked to make a specific commitment to this rule in connection with a particular case. If a commissioner is unwilling to pledge his commitment to the other members of the board, he shall be excluded from participating in that portion of the executive session. 
                  Sec. 2-66b. - Conduct outside of meetings. 
                  A member of the Butts County Board of Commissioners shall not: 
                  (1)	Direct any department head or county employee to do a job or perform a task. All such requests shall be made to the county administrator. Once such a request is made, the commissioners shall follow-up with the county administrator regarding the performance of the work, not with the department head or county employee whom the commissioner expects to do the job. If the job is not performed to the commissioner's satisfaction, this shall be taken up with the county administrator first; if the commissioner is still not satisfied, the matter shall next be discussed with all members of the board of commissioners in executive session, under the exemption to the Open Meetings Act for discussion of employee performance. There shall be no criticism or disparaging remarks made about any county employee in a public meeting unless and until all of these steps have been exhausted. 
                  (2)	Publicly state that he intends to fire or discipline any county employee. No single commissioner has the authority to hire or fire county personnel. 
                  (3)	Reprimand any county employee. If a commissioner believes a county employee should be reprimanded he shall so inform the county administrator. If a commissioner believes the county administrator should be reprimanded he shall notify the other members of the board of commissioners. No single commissioner has the authority to discipline county personnel. 
                  (4)	Use profanity, insulting or demeaning words about a county employee in the presence of that employee, or in the presence of any other county employee. 
                  (5)	Call into question the qualifications or competency of a county employee in the presence of that employee, or in the presence of any other county employee. Concerns of this nature shall be addressed in the stages outline in Section II, Rule 1, above. 
                  (6)	Demand that the county administrator or any department head stop what he or she is doing and immediately attend to the commissioner's business. If the county administrator or a department head requests that the commissioner schedule a time to discuss a matter that is mutually convenient to all concerned, the commissioner shall honor that request. 
                  (7)	Promise on behalf of the county or the board of commissioners to undertake any act, or to pass any ordinance, resolution, contract or agreement. A single commissioner has no authority to bind the board of commissioners. 
                  (8)	Agree to buy or sell anything of value on behalf of the county without advance approval by a majority vote of the board of commissioners. 
                  (9)	Attempt to negotiate county business with any private party or any representative of another governmental unit without the advance approval of a majority of the board of commissioners. By way of example, it is permissible for any commissioner to discuss county business in general terms with private parties and representatives of other governmental units (unless there is actual or threatened litigation against Butts county by the parties involved). However, a commissioner shall not make any written offers, draft any agreements, edit or revise any proposed agreements or plans, or suggest or propose (whether orally or in writing) any specific terms concerning money or services to be provided or received by the county unless that commissioner has received express authorization in advance by a majority vote of the board of commissioners. The fact that the subject matter involves property or persons in a commissioner's district is of no consequence, as a commissioner has no additionally legal authority over a matter simply because it is in his district. 
                  (10)	Speak to any representative of the news media on behalf of the county or the board of commissioners without advance approval by majority vote of the board of commissioners. By way of example, a commissioner is free to express his personal views or opinions to anyone. However, a commissioner shall not make a statement in the name of the board of commissioners or in the name of Butts County unless he has been authorized in advance to do so by majority vote of the board of commissioners. 
                  Sec. 2-66c. - Penalties. 
                  The board of commissioners shall have the responsibility to police itself and to enforce this Ordinance. Any commissioner shall have the right to bring a suspected violation of this Ordinance to the attention of the full board. Any such accusation may be deliberated upon in Executive Session, but a vote upon any penalty to be imposed must be taken in open, public session, with all members of the board of commissioners present. If the board determines by majority vote that a violation of this Ordinance has occurred, the board shall have the authority to impose one or more of the following penalties upon the offending commissioner: 
                  (1)	A verbal censure that shall be noted in the Minutes without further elaboration;
                  (2)	A written censure, to be made a part of the Minutes, specifically outlining the facts underlying the violation; 
                  (3)	Removal of the commissioner from membership on any committee, association or group in which the offending commissioner is in involved in his capacity as Butts County Commissioner; removal shall take place by the delivery of a letter, signed by the board of commissioners, to the head of such committee, association or group, stating that the offending commissioner is no longer authorized to represent Butts County. This sanction shall last for a period of up to one year from the date of offense. 
                  (4)	A fine, not to exceed $500 per offense, which shall be paid by the offending commissioner to the general fund of Butts County, Georgia within ten days of the board's vote establishing a violation; if the offending commissioner fails to make this payment within the time specified herein, the amount of the penalty shall be withheld from the offending commissioner's compensation as a commissioner. 
                  Sec. 2-67. - Public participation. 
                  Public participation in meetings of the board of commissioners shall be permitted in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
                  (1)	Public comments. The final agenda item of the meetings shall be reserved for comments from the public. All members of the public who wish to address the board must submit their name and the topic of their comments to the county administrator at least three business days before the board meeting. These individuals will be allotted three minutes to make their comments, and their comments must be limited to their chosen topic. These limits can be waived by a majority vote of the board. 
                  (2)	Public participation on agenda items. By a majority vote, the board may allow public comment of an agenda item at the time the item is being considered by the board. These comments must be limited to the subject that is being debated. Members of the public may speak for five minutes and may only speak once. These limits can be waived by a majority vote of the board. Anyone wishing to speak at any board meeting must be recognized by the chairman before addressing the board. 
                  (3)	Decorum. Members of the public shall not make inappropriate or offensive comments at a board meeting and are expected to comply with the rules of decorum that are established for commissioners. Individuals who violate any rules of the board may be ruled out of order by the chairman or on a point of order made by a commissioner. A majority vote of the board will rule on the point of order. Any individual who violates the rules of decorum may be removed from the meeting at the direction of the chairman. 
                  (4)	Public hearings. The board may schedule public hearings for the purpose of soliciting public comment on any subject of interest to the board. Hearings may be held immediately prior to, during or following a meeting of the board, or at such other places and times as the board may determine. No official action shall be taken at any such public hearing unless it is conducted during a regular or called meeting of the board.

                  Sec. 2-68. - Parliamentarian. 
                  The county administrator shall serve as the parliamentarian for board meetings.

                  Sec. 2-69. - Amendments to rules. 
                  Any amendments to these rules of order must be submitted by a commissioner in writing to the county administrator three business days before a regular meeting of the board. The proposed amendment shall be included in the agenda for that meeting and distributed to all board members. All amendments to these rules require a two-thirds vote of the board. 
                  (Res. of 7-3-1995, art. I, § 1.14)
                  Sec. 2-70. - Regular meetings. 
                  The regular meetings of the board of commissioners shall be held on the second Monday of each month, except when in conflict with State or Federal holidays.

                  Sec. 2-71. - Special meetings and rescheduled regular meetings. 
                  A regular meeting may be canceled, rescheduled or moved to a new location within the county site by the chairman for any reason. Other special meetings may be scheduled by the chairman or at the request of two commissioners. Whenever a rescheduled regular meeting or any other special meeting is to be held at a time or place other than the regularly scheduled time or place, written notice of the change shall be posted for at least 24 hours at the place of the regular meetings. This written notice shall include the purpose of the meeting. In addition, written or oral notice shall be given by the clerk at least 24 hours in advance of the meeting to the legal organ of the county and to each member of the board of commissioners. 
                  (Res. of 7-3-1995, art. I, § 1.16)
                  Sec. 2-72. - Emergency meetings. 
                  When emergency circumstances occur, the board may hold a meeting with less than 24 hours' notice to the public. When such meetings are to be held, the clerk shall provide notice to the legal organ of the county and to each commissioner as soon as possible. The notice shall include the subjects expected to be considered at the meeting. In addition, the minutes shall reflect the reason for the emergency meeting and the nature of the notice given to the media. 
                  (Res. of 7-3-1995, art. I, § 1.17)
                  Sec. 2-73. - Executive session. 
                  Executive sessions of the board may be held for the purpose of conducting business excepted from public access requirements as authorized by O.C.G.A. §§ 50-14-2 and 50-14-3. Where a meeting of the board is devoted in part to matters within the authorized exceptions to public access requirements, any portion of the meeting not subject to any such exceptions shall be open to the public. No executive session shall be held except pursuant to a majority affirmative vote of the board of commissioners taken in a public meeting. The minutes of the public meeting shall reflect the names of the commissioners present, those voting for the executive session and the specific reasons for the executive session. Minutes of the executive session may be maintained by the clerk of the board of commissioners at the direction of the chairman. Any such minutes shall be maintained in a confidential file and shall not be subject to disclosure, except that disclosures of such portions of minutes identifying real estate to be acquired by the board may only be delayed until such time as the acquisition of the real estate has been completed, terminated, or abandoned or court proceedings have been initiated. Voting on any issue shall not take place during a closed meeting but shall be done, if appropriate, in open session following the executive session.

                  Rules of order may be suspended in the case of an emergency. A motion to suspend the rules requires a second, is debatable and requires a two-thirds vote of the board. Rules governing quorum (section 2-57), voting methods and requirements (sections 2-58 and 2-59), the notification to commissioners of meetings (sections 2-71 and 2-72) and rules necessary for compliance with state law cannot be suspended.

                  Sec. 2-75. - Committees. 
                  The chairman, with the concurrence of the board, may create committees of members of the board to study any issue before the board. Any such committees may make recommendations to the board of commissioners but no committee shall be empowered to make any final decisions on any matter before it for consideration. In addition to board members, committees may include other county officials, staff or citizens at large. Whenever a committee is created, its duties, any limitation of the scope of its duties, and the times, places and periods of time for which the committee may operate shall be determined by the chairman with the concurrence of the board. The chairman shall serve as an ex officio member of all committees.

                  Sec. 2-101. - Main motion. 
                  In order for a board to take any official action on any subject, a commissioner must propose a main motion. A proposed main motion will not be recognized by the chair until another commissioner agrees to second the motion. A second does not require the commissioner seconding the motion to support the motion. A commissioner may withdraw a main motion that he has made at any time before the board has voted on that motion. 
                  (Res. of 7-3-1995, art. II, § 2.01)
                  Sec. 2-102. - Debate. 
                  After the main motion is recognized by the chair, the board shall debate the motion. The debate shall be managed by the chairman in a manner that is fair to all members of the board. Commissioners can participate in the debate only when they are recognized by the chairman. During the course of debate, commissioners may introduce subsidiary motions that propose that the board take a particular action on a motion (section 2-106). There are two classes of subsidiary motions: Debatable subsidiary motions and undebatable subsidiary motions. Debatable subsidiary motions consist of motions to postpone indefinitely, amend, refer to committee and postpone to a time certain. Debatable subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. There are three undebatable subsidiary motions: limit debate, vote immediately and lay on the table. They require a second and cannot be debated. Commissioners may also introduce privileged motions (section 2-107). Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting and can be introduced during the course of debate. Privileged motions consist of a motion to raise a question of privilege and motions to recess and adjourn. The motions to recess and adjourn require a second. Debate is not allowed on privileged motions. 
                  (Res. of 7-3-1995, art. II, § 2.02)
                  Sec. 2-103. - Voting procedure. 
                  Voting on debatable motions and voting on undebatable motions shall take place in accordance with the following provisions: 
                  (1)	Debatable motions. In the case of debatable motions, the vote can be proposed in one of two ways: 
                  a.	If debate has been completed and no other commissioner wishes to speak, the chair can call for the vote. If there are no objections then the chair can proceed with the vote. 
                  b.	If the chairman calls for the vote and there is an objection, a member of the board may move to vote immediately ("move the question"). If this motion is seconded and approved by a two-thirds vote, debate will stop. The chairman will then read the proposed motion to the board and ask for the votes of the commissioners. 
                  (Res. of 7-3-1995, art. II, § 2.03)
                  Sec. 2-104. - Undebatable motions. 
                  In the case of undebatable motions, the vote shall occur immediately after the motion is recognized by the chair. The chairman shall read the proposed motion to the board and then call for the vote. 
                  (Res. of 7-3-1995, art. II, § 2.03)
                  Sec. 2-105. - Ranking of motions. 
                  Each subsidiary and privileged motion is assigned a specific rank. A motion of higher precedence can interrupt a motion of lower precedence. The higher motion must be decided before the board returns to consider the motion of lower precedence. A main motion has the lowest rank and does not take precedence over any other motion. A motion to adjourn has the highest rank and will take precedence over all other subsidiary and privileged motions. The order of precedence of motions shall be in accordance with this section. Motions at the bottom of the following list take precedence over motions at the top of the list. 
                  (1)	Lowest rank: Main motion.
                  (2)	Subsidiary motions (debatable):
                  a.	Postpone indefinitely.
                  b.	Amend.
                  c.	Refer to committee (commit).
                  d.	Postpone to a time certain.
                  (3)	Subsidiary motions (undebatable):
                  a.	Limit debate or extend limits.
                  b.	Vote immediately (previous question).
                  c.	Lay on the table (postpone temporarily).
                  (4)	Privileged motions (undebatable):
                  a.	Question of privilege.
                  b.	Recess.
                  (5)	Highest rank: Adjourn.
                  (Res. of 7-3-1995, art. II, § 2.04)
                  Sec. 2-106. - Subsidiary motions. 
                  During the course of debate, commissioners may introduce motions that propose that the board take a particular action on a main motion. These motions are called subsidiary motions and they allow a board to reach a conclusion on the main motion. Subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. Three subsidiary motions: amend, limit debate and vote immediately, also can apply to subsidiary motions. 
                  (1)	Postpone indefinitely. If a commissioner believes that the main motion should not be considered by the board, that commissioner may move to postpone the consideration of the main motion indefinitely. If the motion is successful, consideration of the main motion stops and the main motion is tabled. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (2)	Amend. If a commissioner believes that a main motion that is on the table should be changed in order to make it more acceptable, he can move to amend the motion. Amendments must be closely related to the original motion and must not change the nature of the motion that they amend. Motions to refer, amend, postpone to a time certain and the motion to recess can also be amended. A motion cannot be amended more than two times. Debate is allowed on a motion to amend only if the original motion is debatable. A majority vote is required for the board to adopt an amendment. If the amendment is adopted then the board shall consider the amended version of the motion. 
                  (3)	Refer to a committee (commit). If a commissioner believes that further information is needed before the board can act on a main motion, he may propose that the motion be referred to a specific committee or department for further study. If an appropriate committee does not already exist, then a committee may be formed as a part of the motion. A motion to refer should specify the date that the committee or department will report back to the board. This motion is debatable and amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (4)	Postpone to a time certain (postpone definitely). A motion to postpone to a certain time may be proposed if a commissioner believes that the main motion should not be considered until a future time. This motion shall set a particular time for the main motion to be considered again. It is debatable and can be amended. If this motion is passed, the chairman will bring the original motion back to the board for consideration at the specified time. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (5)	Limit or extend limits of debate. A motion to limit debate places a time constraint on the length of debate. The details of such a motion are to be decided by the commissioner who makes the motion. This motion can also be used to extend the limits of debate if a limit on debate already exists. Debate is not allowed on this motion and a two-thirds vote is required. 
                  (6)	Vote immediately (previous question). If a commissioner believes that the motion that is being considered should be voted on, the commissioner can move to vote immediately. The motion is undebatable and a two-thirds vote is required. 
                  (7)	Lay on the table (postpone temporarily). A motion to lay on the table proposes that the consideration of a main motion be postponed until a later time in the meeting. The motion can be brought up for consideration only if a motion to resume consideration is accepted by the board during the same meeting. The motion will die if it is not taken up during the meeting. Debate is not allowed on this motion and the motion is not amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (Res. of 7-3-1995, art. II, § 2.05)
                  Sec. 2-107. - Privileged motions. 
                  Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting. They do not address or relate to a main motion and can be introduced whether or not there is a main motion under consideration. Privileged motions take precedence over all subsidiary motions. Debate is not allowed on these motions. 
                  (1)	Question of privilege. A formal question addressed to the chair concerning the rights of a commissioner or of the board as a whole is referred to as a question of privilege. It does not require a second and cannot be debated or amended. The chair is required to make a ruling on the question. 
                  (2)	Recess. A motion to recess proposes that the meeting be suspended for a particular amount of time. The motion must specify the length of the recess. The motion must also be seconded. Debate is not allowed on this motion but the motion can be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (3)	Adjourn. In order for a meeting to come to a close, a commissioner must make a motion to adjourn. The motion to adjourn has the highest rank of any motion and as a result it can be introduced at any time. The motion requires a second, but is not debatable or amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (Res. of 7-3-1995, art. II, § 2.06)
                  Sec. 2-108. - Incidental motions. 
                  Incidental motions allow commissioners to exert their right as a member of the board. Incidental motions can be introduced at any time during a meeting. 
                  (1)	Appeal. If a commissioner disagrees with a decision that is made by the chair, that commissioner may appeal the decision. If the appeal is seconded, the appeal will be considered by the board. The chair has the opportunity to explain the ruling that has been challenged. The board may then debate the appeal. The board shall decide by majority vote if the chair's decision is to be upheld or overturned. An appeal is high in precedence and can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or by a motion to lay on the table. 
                  (2)	Parliamentary inquiry. If a commissioner has a question about the rules of order, he may ask the chair to give an opinion on that question. This question should take the form of a parliamentary inquiry and should relate to the current business of the board. This motion takes precedence over all motions except privileged motions. This motion does not require a second and is not debatable or amendable. 
                  (3)	Point of order (question of order). If a commissioner believes that a violation of the rules of parliamentary procedure has occurred, he can raise a point of order. A second is not required. The chair can make a ruling on the question or can allow the board to debate and then rule on the question by majority vote. A point of order can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or a motion to lay on the table. 
                  (4)	Point of information (request for information). If a commissioner has a question about the facts of a particular issue that is being considered, he may ask a point of information. This motion is addressed first to the chair and then to the appropriate person. A second is not required and the motion is not debatable or amendable. 
                  (Res. of 7-3-1995, art. II, § 2.07)
                  Sec. 2-109. - Supplementary main motions. 
                  Three motions allow the board to act on a main motion that has either been passed or tabled by the board. These motions are considered to be main motions but differ from usual main motions in the way specified. 
                  (1)	Reconsider. The motion to reconsider allows the board to debate whether or not to overturn a decision made at the meeting that is in progress. It allows the board to consider new information that may affect the decision that has already been made. Any commissioner can make a motion to reconsider and any commissioner may second the motion. The motion is debatable but it cannot be amended. A majority vote of the board is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to reconsider is passed, the original decision will be voided and the board will return to debate and vote the original motion. 
                  (2)	Rescind. A motion to rescind proposes that the board overturn a motion passed at a previous meeting. A motion to rescind can be made by any commissioner. It is in order as long as the original motion has not been implemented. An announcement of the intention to rescind a motion may be made at the meeting where the decision was made, or the commissioner seeking to rescind may place the matter on the agenda for the next meeting pursuant to section 2-62. The motion to rescind will then be placed on the agenda for the next meeting. At the next meeting, the motion to rescind will formally be made. If it is seconded, then the board shall debate and vote on rescission. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to rescind is passed, the original decision will be voided. 
                  (3)	Resume consideration. The motion to resume consideration allows the board to consider a motion that has been temporarily postponed. This motion requires a second and is not debatable or amendable. It is a main motion but ranks higher than any debatable motion. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.

                  (8)	Never engage in other conduct which is unbecoming to an official/employee or which constitutes a breach of public trust.

                  For the purpose of this article, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them by this section: 
                  Abandoned animal means any animal which has been placed upon public property or within a public building unattended and uncared for, or upon or within the private property of another without the express permission of the owner, custodian or tenant of the private property and is unattended or without care. An animal shall also be considered as abandoned, for the purposes of this chapter, which has been upon or within the property of the owner or custodian of this animal for a period of time in excess of 36 hours unattended and without proper food, water and shelter. Abandonment shall also include failure to provide reasonable remedy or relief for any injured or diseased animal. An animal shall also be considered as abandoned if the owner is notified of impoundment and refuses to reclaim the animal. If the animal is owner surrendered, the animal is considered abandoned. 
                  Adequate food means sufficient quantity of non-contaminated and nutritionally healthy sustenance that is appropriate to the species, breed, size, age and health of the animal, or at the direction of a licensed veterinarian, which is sufficient to prevent starvation, malnutrition, or risk to the animal's health. Garbage, spoiled, rancid, or contaminated food is not adequate food. 
                  Adequate shelter means protective cover appropriate for the species and providing adequate space to maintain the animal in good health, which also prevents pain, suffering or a significant risk to the animal's health. Adequate shelter shall consist of a completely enclosed structure with four sides with a door opening, a constructed floor, and a roof.

                  ARTICLE I. - FORECLOSED AND VACANT PROPERTY REGISTRY 

                  Sec. 15-1. - Short title. 
                  This article shall be known as the "Butts County Vacant and Foreclosed Property Registry Ordinance." 
                  (Ord. of 7-14-2014, § 2)
                  Sec. 15-2. - Findings and intent. 
                  This article is adopted to address the interest of public safety. 
                  (1)	The governing authority finds that there is a need to establish a foreclosure and vacant real property registry as a mechanism to protect property values in neighborhoods for all property owners. 
                  (2)	Due to the lack of adequate maintenance and security of properties that are foreclosed or where ownership has been transferred after foreclosure, the property values and quality of life of neighboring properties are negatively impacted. 
                  (3)	Improperly maintained and secured foreclosed properties can become a hazard to the health and safety of persons who may come on or near the property and can adversely affect the aesthetic and economic attributes of communities. Difficulties also often arise in locating the person responsible for the condition of foreclosed real property. The governing authority finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the provisions in this article. 
                  (4)	This foreclosure and vacant real property registry will require owners and agents to provide the county with official information for contacting a party responsible for bringing foreclosed and vacant real property into compliance with applicable provisions of the official code of Butts County, Georgia.

                  B.	Fencing. 
                  1.	Fescing shall be a continuous translucent, perforated barrier extending from the surface of the ground to a uniform height of not less eight feet from the ground at all points, constructed of 9 gauge wire, with all post and top rails to meet "Schedule 40" requirements. 
                  2.	Posts are to be set at a minimum of ten feet apart with 2 ½)-inch corner posts with caps on all corner, end and line posts. All line and corner posts are to be set 30 inches deep in the ground in a hole 8 inches in diameter filled with cement. The fence shall have #7 gauge tension wire attached to the fence with rings spaced approximately 24 inches apart. 
                  3.	The fence shall be designed to withstand a minimum wind load of 20 pounds per square foot and shall be of a permanent nature. All materials used for fencing shall have a non-reflective surface. 
                  C.	Screening required. Screening to the specifications required shall be required along the perimeter of every junkyard, salvage yard, auto and recycling centers in the following situations: 
                  1.	A solid opaque fence is to be used to satisfy the fencing requirement. It shall be of a uniform color scheme and geometric design. 
                  2.	The property shall be entirely surrounded by a chain link fence a minimum of eight feet in height (installed with opaque screening material) and with vegetation that provides a continuous all-seasons opaque screen at least eight feet in height within five years of planting or setting such vegetation.

                  (3)	Code enforcement. Upon the declaration of a state of emergency by the governor, or upon the determination by the county governing authority, or its designee, of the existence of an emergency or disaster, the county governing authority, their designee or the emergency interim successor may temporarily suspend the enforcement of the Code of Ordinances of Butts county, or any portion thereof, where: (a) the emergency or disaster is of such nature that immediate action outside the Code is required; (b) such suspension is consistent with the protection of the public health, safety and welfare; and (c) such suspension is not inconsistent with any federal or state statutes or regulations.

                  The sheriff, fire chief or code enforcement official, in such case, shall keep a record of the expenses and costs of abating the nuisance, and the costs shall be billed against the violator and/or owner, agent or tenant for collection as for county revenues.

                  Sec. 34-213. - Exemptions. 
                  This article shall apply to any land-disturbing activity undertaken by any person on any land except for the following: 
                  1.	Surface mining, as the same is defined in O.C.G.A. § 12-4-72, "The Georgia Surface Mining Act of 1968;" 
                  2.	Granite quarrying and land clearing for such quarrying;
                  3.	Such minor land-disturbing activities as home gardens and individual home landscaping, repairs, maintenance work, fences, and other related activities which result in minor soil erosion; 
                  4.	The construction of single-family residences, when such construction disturbs less than one acre and is not a part of a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre and not otherwise exempted under this paragraph; provided, however, that construction of any such residence shall conform to the minimum requirements as set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 and this paragraph. For single-family residence construction covered by the provisions of this paragraph, there shall be a buffer zone between the residence and any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. In any such buffer zone, no land-disturbing activity shall be constructed between the residence and the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action from the banks of the trout waters. For primary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. For secondary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, but the director may grant variances to no less than 25 feet. Regardless of whether a trout stream is primary or secondary, for first order trout waters, which are streams into which no other streams flow except for springs, the buffer shall be at least 25 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. The minimum requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b) and the buffer zones provided by this paragraph shall be enforced by the local issuing authority; 
                  5.	Agricultural operations as defined in O.C.G.A. § 1-3-3, "definitions", to include raising, harvesting or storing of products of the field or orchard; feeding, breeding or managing livestock or poultry; producing or storing feed for use in the production of livestock, including but not limited to cattle, calves, swine, hogs, goats, sheep, and rabbits or for use in the production of poultry, including but not limited to chickens, hens and turkeys; producing plants, trees, fowl, or animals; the production of aquaculture, horticultural, dairy, livestock, poultry, eggs and apiarian products; farm buildings and farm ponds; 
                  6.	Forestry land management practices, including harvesting; provided, however, that when such exempt forestry practices cause or result in land-disturbing or other activities otherwise prohibited in a buffer, as established in paragraphs (15) and (16) of section 34-214.C, no other land-disturbing activities, except for normal forest management practices, shall be allowed on the entire property upon which the forestry practices were conducted for a period of three years after completion of such forestry practices; 
                  7.	Any project carried out under the technical supervision of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) of the United States Department of Agriculture; 
                  8.	Any project involving less than one acre of disturbed area; provided, however, that this exemption shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity within a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre or within 200 feet of the bank of any state waters, and for purposes of this paragraph, "state waters" excludes channels and drainage ways which have water in them only during and immediately after rainfall events and intermittent streams which do not have water in them year-round; provided, however, that any person responsible for a project which involves less than one acre, which involves land-disturbing activity, and which is within 200 feet of any such excluded channel or drainage way, must prevent sediment from moving beyond the boundaries of the property on which such project is located and provided, further, that nothing contained herein shall prevent the local issuing authority from regulating any such project which is not specifically exempted by paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 or 10 of this section; 
                  9.	Construction or maintenance projects, or both, undertaken or financed in whole or in part, or both, by the department of transportation, the Georgia Highway Authority, or the state road and tollway authority; or any road construction or maintenance project, or both, undertaken by any county or municipality; provided, however, that construction or maintenance projects of the department of transportation or the state road and tollway authority which disturb one or more contiguous acres of land shall be subject to provisions of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7.1; except where the department of transportation, the Georgia Highway Authority, or the state road and tollway authority is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state general permit, in which case a copy of a notice of intent under the state general permit shall be submitted to the local issuing authority, the local issuing authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders; 
                  10.	Any land-disturbing activities conducted by any electric membership corporation or municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the public service commission, any utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as defined in O.C.G.A. § 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United States engaged in the generation, transmission, or distribution of power; except where an electric membership corporation or municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the public service commission, any utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as defined in O.C.G.A. § 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United States engaged in the generation, transmission, or distribution of power is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state general permit, in which case the local issuing authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders; and

                  (Ord. of 4-9-2012(04), § 34-213)
                  Sec. 34-214. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  A.	General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of section 34-214.B and .C. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this ordinance and the NPDES general permit. 
                  B.	Minimum requirements/BMPs.
                  1.	Best management practices as set forth in section 34-214.B and .C shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  2.	A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  3.	Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  4.	The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  5.	The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in section 34-214.C.15. and .16, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  C.	The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  1.	Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  2.	Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
                  3.	Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  4.	Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
                  5.	The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  6.	Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
                  7.	Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  8.	Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  9.	To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  10.	Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  11.	Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
                  12.	Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  13.	Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  14.	Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 34-214.B.2; 
                  15.	Except as provided in paragraph 16 of this subsection, there is established a 25 foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. 
                  The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.	No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.	The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  16.	There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed ; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.	No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.	The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  D.	Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in section 34-214.B. and .C. 
                  E.	The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. of 4-9-2012(04), § 34-214)
                  Sec. 34-215. - Application/permit process. 
                  A.	General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  B.	Application requirements. 
                  1.	No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of county without first obtaining a permit from the Butts County community services department to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  2.	The application for a permit shall be submitted to the Butts County community services department and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 34-215.C. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 34-214.B and .C will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by two copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  3.	In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the Division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  4.	Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the District to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the Local Issuing Authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the District, and any variances required by section 34-214.C.15 and .16 has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per section 34-215.B.6, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  5.	If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  6.	The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  C.	Plan requirements. 
                  1.	Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 34-214.B and .C, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  2.	Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  D.	Permits. 
                  1.	Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  2.	No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 34-214.C.15 and .16 are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per section 34-215.B.6 are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  3.	Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this ordinance, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  4.	If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  5.	The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  6.	The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
                  7.	No permit shall be issued unless the applicant provides a statement by the tax commissioners office certifying that all ad valorem taxes levied against the property and due and owing have been paid. 
                  (Ord. of 4-9-2012(04), § 34-215)
                  Sec. 34-216. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  A.	The Butts County community Development department will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  B.	The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  C.	The Butts County community development department shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  D.	No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  E.	The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  F.	The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the Division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  Sec. 34-217. - Penalties and incentives. 
                  A.	Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  B.	Stop-work orders. 
                  1.	For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  2.	For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and 
                  3.	All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; 
                  4.	When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  C.	Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this ordinance and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 34-215.B.6. The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  D.	Monetary penalties. 
                  1.	Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any city charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article under county ordinances approved under this article shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

                  --- (5) --- 
                  Editor's note—Ord. of 3-1-1999(2), §§ 1-8, 10, adopted March 1, 1999, did not specifically amend this Code. Hence, its inclusion as §§ 34-331—34-339 was at the discretion of the editor. See the Code Comparative Table.

                  Sec. 34-331. - Title of the article, findings, and objectives. 
                  (a)	Title of article. This article shall be known as the Aquifer Recharge Area Protection Ordinance of Butts County, Georgia. 
                  (b)	Findings of fact. In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the county and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be insured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that Butts County, Georgia, and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water. Groundwater resources are contained within aquifers, which are permeable, rock strata occupying vast subsurface regions. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of stormwater runoff in zones of the surface known as aquifer recharge areas. 
                  Aquifers are susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant aquifer recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within aquifer recharge zones in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized. 
                  (c)	[Adoption of aquifer recharge protection ordinance.] The Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the Georgia Department of Community Affairs have determined that each local government with "significant groundwater recharge areas" (identified on the Ground Water Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia Hydrologic Atlas #20) must adopt an aquifer recharge protection ordinance under the requirements of House Bill 215, Georgia's 1989 Growth Strategies Legislation and the rules promulgated thereunder. 
                  (d)	Objectives. The objectives of this article are: 
                  (1)	Protect groundwater by prohibiting land uses that generate dangerous pollutants in recharge areas; 
                  (2)	Protect groundwater by limiting density of development; and
                  (3)	Protect groundwater by reducing adverse effects on groundwater from the development that occurs within the recharge area; 
                  (4)	Comply with the requirements of the Georgia 1989 Growth Strategies Legislation.
                  (Ord. of 3-1-1999(2), § 1; Ord. of 4-9-2012(04), § 34-331)
                  Sec. 34-332. - Definitions. 
                  [The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this article, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:] 
                  Aquifer means a layer or formation of rock beneath the earth's surface that bears significant amounts of groundwater. 
                  Aquifer recharge area (synonymous with groundwater recharge area) means an area of the earth's surface where water infiltrates the ground, thereby replenishing the groundwater supplies within an aquifer. 
                  Aquifer recharge area district means all lands within unincorporated Butts County which are indicated as "most significant groundwater recharge areas …" on the Ground-Water Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia. 
                  Board of commissioners means the board of commissioners of Butts County, Georgia. 
                  Building inspector means the Butts County building inspection department. 
                  Development permit shall include: (1) building permits excepting those exempted in section 34-235(3), (2) rezone applications, (3) preliminary and final subdivision plat applications, (4) conditional use permit applications and (5) variance applications. 
                  Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of an aquifer to pollution from chemical spills, leaching of pollutants from dump sites, or other human activities. 
                  Pollution susceptibility map(s) mean maps prepared by the Georgia department of natural resources (DNR) that show the relative susceptibility of aquifers to pollution. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas of high, medium, and low groundwater pollution potential. 
                  Significant aquifer recharge areas mean areas mapped by DNR in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 Edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology (chemical nature and form of the rock), soil type, and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts, geologic structure, presence of "karst" topography (sinkholes, caves, and fissures associated with limestone and other carbonate rock), and potentiometric surfaces. 
                  (Ord. of 3-1-1999(2), § 10; Ord. of 4-9-2012(04), § 34-332)
                  Sec. 34-335. - Permit requirements and enforcement. 
                  No building permit, rezoning request, or subdivision plan may be approved by Butts County or its designee unless the permit, request or plan is in compliance with the aquifer protection standards listed in section 34-336. 
                  (1)	Enforcement. Butts County or its designee, their agent, officers, and employees shall have authority to enter upon privately owned land for the purpose of performing their duties under this article and may take or cause to be made such examination, surveys, or sampling as Butts County or its designee deems necessary. 
                  a.	The Butts County zoning and planning department and the Butts County building inspector are hereby designated respectively as the administrator and enforcement officer for this article. 
                  b.	The county building inspector shall have authority to enforce this article; issue permits thereunder; and address violations or threatened violations thereof by issuance of violation notices, administrative orders, and civil and criminal actions. All costs, fees, and expenses in connection with such actions may be recovered as damages against the violator. 
                  c.	Law enforcement officials or other officials having police powers shall have authority to assist the county building inspector in enforcement. 
                  d.	Any person who commits, takes part in, or assists in any violation of any provision of this article shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished as provided by law. Each violation of this act shall be a separate offense, and, in the case of a continuing violation, each day's continuance shall be deemed to be a separate and [distinct] offense. 
                  e.	The county building inspector shall have the authority to issue cease and desist orders in the event of any violation of this article. Cease and desist orders may be appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction, as identified in section 34-337. 
                  f.	When a building or other structure has been constructed in violation of this article, the violator shall be required to remove the structure or bring said structure into compliance with this article. 
                  g.	When removal of vegetative cover, excavation or fill has taken place in violation of this article, the violator shall be required to restore the affected land to its original contours and to restore vegetation, as far as practicable. 
                  (2)	Permit review and site plan requirement. Applications for a development permit within the aquifer recharge area district shall include a site plan, with the exception of certain exempted activities identified in subsection (3) of this section. The following information is required for all site plans: 
                  a.	A map shall be drawn to a scale of one inch equals 50 feet or other appropriate scale as determined by the county, showing all planned improvements including the width, depth, and length of all existing and proposed structures, roads, water courses, and drainage ways; water, waste water, and storm water facilities; and utility installations. 
                  b.	Location, dimensions and area of all impervious surfaces, both existing and proposed, on the site. 
                  c.	The orientation and distance from the boundaries of the proposed site to the nearest bank of an affected perennial stream or water body. 
                  d.	Elevations of the site and adjacent lands within 200 feet of the site at contour intervals of no greater than five feet. 
                  e.	Location and detailed design of any spill and leak collection systems designed for the purpose of containing accidentally released hazardous or toxic materials. 
                  f.	Calculations of the amount of cut and fill proposed and cross-section drawings showing existing and proposed grades in areas of fill or excavation. Elevations, horizontal scale, and vertical scale, and vertical scale must be shown on cross-sectional drawings. 
                  g.	Activities to comply with site plan. All development activities or site work conducted after approval of the site plan shall conform with the specifications of said site plan. Significant changes to the site plan, that would alter the amount and velocity of storm water runoff from the site, increase the amount of impervious surface within the development, alter the overall density of development, result in a considerable increase in the amount of excavation, fill, or removal of vegetation during construction, or otherwise result in an alteration of the overall appearance of the development proposed, can be amended only with the approval of the county. Minor charges, such as realignment of other infrastructure, to meet unexpected conditions, are exempted from this requirement. 
                  (3)	Exemptions to site plan requirements. The following activities and developments are exempt from the requirement for detailed site plans: 
                  a.	Single-family detached homes constructed within a subdivision of fewer than five parcels.
                  b.	Repairs to a facility that is part of a previously approved and permitted development.
                  c.	Construction of minor structures, such as sheds, or additions to single-family residences.

                  Editor's note—Ord. of 3-1-1999(3), §§ 1—8, 10, adopted March 1, 1999, did not specifically amend this Code. Hence, its inclusion as §§ 34-376—34-384 was at the discretion of the editor. See the Code Comparative Table.

                  Sec. 34-376. - Findings and purpose. 
                  (a)	Findings of fact. The wetlands within the county are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; open space; and recreational opportunities; in addition, the economic well-being of many communities within the State of Georgia. 
                  Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution, and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
                  The Georgia Department of Natural resources and the Georgia department of community affairs have determined that each local government with classified wetlands located in its jurisdiction must adopt a wetlands protection ordinance under the requirements of House Bill 215, Georgia's 1989 Growth Strategies Legislation and the rules promulgated thereunder. 
                  It is therefore necessary for Butts County, Georgia to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities in wetlands that may adversely affect wetlands. 
                  (b)	Title and purpose. This article shall be known as the Wetland Protection Ordinance of Butts County, Georgia. The purposes of this article are to promote wise use of wetlands and protect wetlands, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational, and aesthetic values. Activities which may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined by a permitting process. The objective of this article is to protect wetlands from alterations which will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, flood plain and erosion control, ground water recharge, aesthetic nature, and wildlife areas and to comply with the requirements of state law related to wetland protection.

                  Generalized wetland map. The generalized wetland map shall be a subset of the U.S. Department of Interior national wetlands inventory maps. 
                  Hydric soils means soils that form as a result of saturated soils conditions. A list of these soils is maintained by the soil conservation service. 
                  Hydrophytic vegetation means macrophytic plants tolerant of or dependent on saturated soil conditions. 
                  Jurisdictional determination means an official, written statement or map signed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland means a wetland area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  Regulated activity means any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States excepting those activities exempted in section 34-379(b) of this article and exempted in Section 404 of the Federal Clean water Act. 
                  Silviculture means the art of producing, reproducing and growing a forest of distinctive stands of trees. 
                  Temporary emergency permit means a temporary permit that may be issued in certain circumstances specified herein. 
                  Wetland means an area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and distribution sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances does support a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, commonly known as hydrophytic vegetation. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. 
                  Wetland delineation means the establishment of wetland boundaries by a representative of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or an authority designated by the Corps. 
                  Wetland protective district means all wetlands within the jurisdiction of the county which are indicated on the Generalized Wetland Map as "wetlands providing significant wildlife habitat and/or which may be subject to extensive mitigation". 
                  (Ord. of 3-1-1999(2), § 10; Ord. of 4-9-2012(04), § 34-377)
                  Sec. 34-378. - Wetland Protection District. 
                  (a)	Wetland protection district. This article shall apply to all wetlands within the wetland protection district as defined herein and located within the jurisdiction of the county. The generalized wetland map, adopted as part of this article, shows the general location of wetlands and of the wetland protection district and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands before engaging in a regulated activity. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the county zoning administrator. 
                  (b)	Wetland protection district boundaries. The generalized wetlands map is a general reference document and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a Section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not necessarily represent the exact boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the county and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
                  (Ord. of 3-1-1999(2), § 2; Ord. of 4-9-2012(04), § 34-378)
                  Sec. 34-379. - Local development permits. 
                  (a)	Local development permit requirements. No regulated activity will be allowed within the wetland protection district without written permission from the county or its designee in the form of a local development permit. Issuance of a local development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. All activities that are not exempted in section 34-379(b) or by other local development ordinances, shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a local development permit. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of the wetland protection district boundary, as determined from the generalized wetland map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present and that a Section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, a local development permit or letter of permission is required, a local development permit will be issued only following issuance of the Section 404 permit or letter of permission. 
                  (b)	Permissible uses (use as a right). The following uses shall be allowed as a right within the wetland protection district to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other article or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein. 
                  (1)	Operations conducted during normal silvicultural activities, including minor dredge and fill associated with road construction, harvesting, and reforestation practices provided they meet the performance standards and road construction best management practices required under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
                  (2)	Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, and other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit. 
                  (3)	Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing. 
                  (4)	Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia forestry commission. 
                  (5)	The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the Georgia department of agriculture. 
                  (6)	The pasturing of livestock provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and that approved best management practices are followed. 
                  (7)	Education, scientific research, and nature trails.
                  (8)	Temporary emergency permit. A temporary emergency permit can be issued by the county or its designee for the following reasons: 
                  •	Maintenance or repair of lawfully located roads or structures and of facilities used in the service of the public to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telegraph, telecommunication or other services, provided that such roads, structures, or facilities are not materially changed or enlarged and that, prior to the commencement of work, written notice has been given to the county or its designee and provided that the work is conducted using best management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns, and chemical and biological characteristics of the wetland are not impaired and that any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be minimized. 
                  •	Temporary water level stabilization measures associated with silvicultural operations, provided that they are necessary to alleviate abnormally wet or dry conditions that would have an adverse impact on the conduct of silvicultural activities if not corrected. 
                  •	Limited ditching, tilling, dredging, excavating, or filling done solely for the purpose of maintaining or repairing existing drainage systems necessary for the cultivation of agricultural crops, provided that the maintenance or repair activity does not result in the impairment, alteration, or loss of wetlands not previously subject to agricultural and silvicultural use under the terms and provisions of section 34-379(b). 
                  •	Limited excavating and filling necessary for the repair and maintenance of piers, walkways, nature trails, observation decks, wildlife management shelters, boathouses, or other similar water-related structures, provided that they are built on pilings to allow unobstructed flow of water and preserve the natural contour of the wetland. 
                  (c)	Site plans. Applications for a development permit within the generalized wetland protection district shall include a site plan, drawn at a scale of one inch equals 50 feet, (the county may approve a different scale where necessary to clearly provide the required information) with the following information: 
                  (1)	A map of all planned excavation and fill, including calculations of the volume of cut and fill involved, cross-sectional drawings showing existing and proposed grades. Elevations, horizontal scale, vertical scale must be shown on the cross-sectional drawings.

                  "Area of shallow flooding" means a designated AO or AH zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet, and/or where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. 
                  "Area of special flood hazard" is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. In the absence of official designation by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, areas of special flood hazard shall be those designated by the local community and referenced in [section 42-37]. 
                  "Base flood" means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
                  "Base flood elevation (BFE)." The elevation shown on the flood insurance rate map for zones AE, AH, A1-A30, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/A1-A30, AR/AH, AR/AO, V1-V30, and VE that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one percent chance of equaling or exceeding that level in any given year. 
                  "Basement" means that portion of a building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
                  "Building" means any structure built for support, shelter, or enclosure for any occupancy or storage. 
                  "Critical facility" means any public or private facility, which, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the disaster or would increase the hazard to life and health. Critical facilities include: 
                  (a)	Structures or facilities that produce, use, or store highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic, or water-reactive materials; 
                  (b)	Hospitals and nursing homes, and housing for the elderly, which are likely to contain occupants who may not be sufficiently mobile to avoid the loss of life or injury during flood and storm events; 
                  (c)	Emergency operation centers or data storage centers which contain records or services that may become lost or inoperative during flood and storm events; and

                  "Elevated building" means a non-basement building built to have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns, piers, or shear walls adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a base flood event. 
                  "Existing construction" means, for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced before March 18, 1996. 
                  "Existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before January 1, 1995. 
                  "Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads. 
                  "Flood" or "flooding" means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
                  (a.)	The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or
                  (b.)	The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.
                  "Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM)" means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Insurance Administration, where the boundaries of areas of special flood hazard have been defined as zone A. 
                  "Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)" means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Insurance Administration, delineating the areas of special flood hazard and/or risk premium zones applicable to the community.

                  "Flood-proofing" means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
                  "Floodplain" means any land area susceptible to flooding. 
                  "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  "Freeboard" means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  "Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  "Historic structure" means any structure that is; 
                  a.	Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

                  2.	Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.
                  "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this Code. 
                  "Manufactured home" means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
                  "Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
                  "Mean sea level" means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced. 
                  "National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD)" as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  "New construction" means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced after March 18, 1996, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, new construction means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after January 1, 1995, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  "New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after January 1, 1995. 
                  "North American Vertical Datum (NAVD)" has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA flood modernization maps. 
                  "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is: 
                  a.	Built on a single chassis;
                  b.	400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;
                  c.	Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and
                  d.	Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
                  "Start of construction" means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: accessory structures are not exempt from any article requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  "Structure" means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  "Subdivision" means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the start of construction of the improvement. Note: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
                  "Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions" is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  "Variance" is a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  Sec. 42-33. - Findings of fact. 
                  (1)	The flood hazard areas of Butts County, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (2)	These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. of 7-27-2009, § 42-33)
                  Sec. 42-34. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)	Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)	Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; and 
                  (4)	Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)	Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  (Ord. of 7-27-2009, § 42-34)

                  (c)	Design certification from a registered professional engineer or architect that any proposed non-residential flood-proofed structure will meet the flood-proofing criteria of Section 42-92(2); 
                  (d)	Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of a proposed development; and 
                  (2)	Construction stage. For all new construction and substantial improvements, the permit holder shall provide to the administrator an as-built certification of the regulatory floor elevation or flood-proofing level immediately after the lowest floor or flood-proofing is completed. Any lowest floor certification made relative to mean sea level shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same. When flood-proofing is utilized for non-residential structures, said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by same. 
                  Any work undertaken prior to submission of these certifications shall be at the permit holder's risk. The zoning administrator shall review the above referenced certification data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further progressive work being allowed to proceed. Failure to submit certification or failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.

                  DIVISION 3. - FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 42-91. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)	New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)	New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)	New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)	Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater; 
                  (a)	Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  (i)	Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  (ii)	The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and
                  (iii)	Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction; 
                  (b)	So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this ordinance, the unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  (c)	The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms; 
                  (5)	All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
                  (6)	Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces; 
                  (7)	New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
                  (8)	New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
                  (9)	On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
                  (10)	Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this article shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
                  (Ord. of 7-27-2009, § 42-91)
                  Sec. 42-92. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)	New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of Section 42-91(4), "Elevated Buildings." 
                  (a)	All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)	Non-residential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in Section 42-68(6). 
                  (3)	Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  (a)	All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (b)	Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  (i)	The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  (ii)	The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  (c)	All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. Section 42-91(6)) 
                  (d)	All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
                  (i)	Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
                  (ii)	Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  (iii)	The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections (3)a or (3)c of this section. 
                  (4).	Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 42-37, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (a)	Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  (b)	Only if subsection (4)a of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of [division 3 of this] article.

                  Sec. 42-93. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Section 42-37, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)	When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with Section 42-37, then the zoning administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of [division 3 of this] article. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following subsections (2) and (3) shall apply: 
                  (2)	No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)	In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (Note: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed.) Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of Section 42-91(4), "Elevated Buildings." 
                  (a)	All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  The zoning administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.

                  Sec. 42-94. - Standards for areas of special flood hazard (zones AE) with established base flood elevations without designated floodways. 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Section 42-37, where streams with base flood elevations are provided but no floodways have been designated (zones AE), the following provisions apply: 
                  1.	No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 
                  2.	New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or flood-proofed to elevations established in accordance with Section 42-92. 
                  (Ord. of 7-27-2009, § 42-94)
                  Sec. 42-95. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). 
                  Areas of special flood hazard established in Section 42-37 may include designated AO shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
                  (1)	All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of Section 42-91(4), "Elevated Buildings." 
                  The zoning administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (2)	New construction or the substantial improvement of a non-residential structure may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in Sections 42-67(1)(c) and 42-67(2). 
                  (3)	Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.

                  Sec. 42-96. - Standards for subdivisions. 
                  (1)	All subdivision and/or development proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
                  (2)	All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
                  (3)	All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and 
                  (4)	For subdivisions and/or developments greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less, base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions. Any changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted to FEMA for review as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. Upon completion of the project, the developer is responsible for submitting the as-built data to FEMA in order to obtain the final LOMR.

                  Sec. 42-98. - Variance procedures. 
                  (A)	The Butts County board of appeals, as established by the board of commissioners, shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
                  (B)	The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the zoning administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
                  (C)	Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of appeals may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Butts County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (D)	Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (E)	Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (F)	Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (G)	In reviewing such requests, the board of appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (H)	Conditions for variances.
                  (1)	A variance shall be issued only when there is:
                  (i)	A finding of good and sufficient cause;
                  (ii)	A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  (iii)	A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)	The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)	The zoning administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (I)	Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the board of appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  Editor's note—The standards for off-street parking and service facilities codified in this article were adopted by the county as appendix I to the county's zoning ordinance on March 16, 1998.
                  Cross reference— Traffic and vehicles, ch. 86.

                  Sec. 66-76. - Scope of article. 
                  This article covers specifications for off-street parking and service facilities in the county. Requirements for such facilities are specified by zoning district in the county zoning ordinance. Such zoning ordinance refers the reader to this article for specifications of required facilities. 
                  (Ord. of 3-16-1998(1), app. I, § 101)
                  Sec. 66-77. - General standards for parking space design. 
                  (a)	Spaces must not be reduced. Off-street parking spaces must not be reduced below the minimum required number for the use or facility to which they are assigned. 
                  (b)	Drainage, construction and maintenance. All off-street parking, loading and service areas must be drained so as to prevent damage to abutting properties and/or public streets, and must be constructed of materials which will ensure a surface resistant to erosion. All such areas must be at all times maintained at the expense of the owners in a clean, orderly and dustfree condition to the extent that it does not create a nuisance. 
                  (c)	Separation from walkways, sidewalks and streets. All off-street parking, loading and service areas must be separated from walkways, sidewalks and streets by curbing or other suitable protective device. 
                  (d)	Parking area design. Parking stalls must have a minimum width of 9½ feet and length of 18 feet. There must be provided adequate interior driveways to connect each parking space with a public right-of-way. Interior driveways must be at least 24 feet wide where used with 90-degree angle parking, and at least 12 feet wide where used with 60-degree angle parking, and at least 12 feet wide where used with 45-degree angle parking, and at least 12 feet wide where used with parallel parking. Where there is no parking, interior driveways must be at least 12 feet wide for one-way traffic movement and at least 24 feet wide for two-way traffic movement. 
                  (e)	Joint parking facilities. Two or more neighboring uses of the same or different types may provide joint parking facilities as long as the number of off-street parking spaces are not less than the sum of the individual requirements. 
                  (f)	Pavement markings and signs. Each off-street parking space must be clearly marked, and directional arrows or signs must be provided wherever necessary. Markers, directional arrows and signs must be properly maintained so as to ensure their maximum efficiency. 
                  (Ord. of 3-16-1998(1), app. I, § 102)

                  (1)	Spaces appropriate to functions. Off-street loading spaces must be provided as appropriate to the functions and scope of operation or individual or groups of buildings and uses. 
                  (2)	Design of loading spaces. Off-street loading spaces must be designed and constructed so that all maneuvering to park and unpark vehicles for loading can take place entirely within the property lines of the premises. Loading spaces must be provided so as not to interfere with the free, normal movement of vehicles and pedestrians on public rights-of-way. 
                  (3)	Ingress and egress. Ingress and egress to off-street loading spaces must conform to curb cut requirements specified in this article. 
                  (Ord. of 3-16-1998(1), app. I, § 104)
                  Sec. 66-80. - Curb cut requirements. 
                  In any case in which a provision for ingress and egress involves the lowering or cutting away of curbs, such a curb cut is subject to the following provisions: 
                  (1)	Only one combined entrance and exit is allowed for any parcel of property with a frontage on any one street of less than 50 feet. No more than two combined entrances and exits are allowed for any parcel of property with a frontage on any one street of between 50 feet and 200 feet. For parcels of property having frontage on any one street of more than 200 feet, additional entrances or exits are permitted only after the developer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the planning commission that more curb cuts are needed for safety reasons, and such additional curb cuts are approved by the planning commission. 
                  (2)	At street intersections, curb cuts must be located at least 25 feet from the intersections of the two curblines (or such lines extended) or at least 15 feet from the intersection of the two intersecting property lines (or such lines extended), whichever is less. 
                  (3)	The distance between any two curb cuts on the same side of the street and located on one property must be at least ten feet. That distance is measured between the points at which the two curb cuts begin to deviate from the established curb line of the abutting street (in other words, between the intersections of the curb return radii and the established curbline of the abutting street). 
                  (4)	The minimum setback from all property lines for any driveway is two feet.
                  (5)	The maximum permitted width of any driveway at the right-of-way line of the abutting street is 35 feet. 
                  (6)	The maximum permitted width of any curb cut, including the points at which the curb cut begins to deviate from the established curbline of the abutting street at either end of the curb cut (in other words, including the curb returns) is 50 feet. However, the zoning administrator may approve a specified larger width for a truckstop, if he determines that a larger curb cut is needed for safety reasons. 
                  (7)	The sum of the two curb return radii for any one curb cut must not exceed 15 feet.

In this event, the utility shall reimburse the county for the acquisition costs. 
                  (c)	Title to property acquired for utility relocations under subsection (a) or (b) of this section and as authorized by section 70-176 may be transferred to such utility as authorized in section 70-178.

In levying occupation tax upon a business or practitioner with a location or office situated in more than one jurisdiction, including businesses or practitioners with one or more locations or offices in the state and one or more locations outside the state, the county shall allocate the gross receipts of the business or practitioner for occupation tax purposes in accordance with one of the following methods:

Where the business or practitioner cannot reasonably allocate the dollar amount of gross receipts among multiple locations or offices, the business or practitioner shall divide the gross receipts reported to all local governments in the state by the number of locations or offices of the business or practitioner which contributed to the gross receipts reported to any local government in the state and shall allocate an equal percentage of such gross receipts of the business or practitioner to each location or office. 
                  b.	In no instance shall the sum of the portions of the total gross receipts of a business or practitioner taxed by all local governments exceed 100 percent of the total gross receipts of the business or practitioner.

                  1.	Financial information necessary to allocate the gross receipts of the business or practitioner; and

                  e.	When more than one local government levies occupation tax on a business or practitioner that has locations encompassed by more than one local government and the local governments use different criteria for taxation in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 48-13-10, local governments which use the criterion described in O.C.G.A. § 48-13-10(a)(3) are not authorized to tax any greater proportion of the gross receipts than authorized by subsection (a) of same, and local governments which use the number of employees as a criterion for taxation are authorized to tax the number of employees who are employed within the local government's geographic jurisdiction. In the case of an employee who works for the same business or practitioner in more than one municipal corporation or county, the municipal corporation or county in which the employee works for the longest period of time within the calendar year shall be authorized to count the individual as an employee who is employed within the local government's geographic jurisdiction for purposes of occupation tax.

                  (1)	All occupation taxes levied by this article are levied on amount of business to be transacted during the calendar year. However, for convenience of both county and the taxpayer and the necessity of making numerous returns, those businesses subject to the occupation tax shall, on or before the times set forth in this article, file with the revenue collection officer the returns specifically provided for in this section, showing the gross receipts of that business during the preceding calendar year. This return shall be used as an estimate for making payments on the occupation tax for current calendar year, the actual and final amount of tax levied for business transacted in a current calendar year to be paid in accordance with a final return to be made after the termination of the date, in accordance with the procedure set forth in this article. 
                  (2)	The owner, proprietor, manager or secretary officer or the business subject to such occupation tax of the current calendar year shall, at the end of the preceding year and on or before May 1 of the current calendar year, file with the revenue collection officer, on a form furnished by the revenue collection officer, a signed return, setting forth the amount of gross receipts of such business for the entire preceding calendar year, to be used as an estimate of the gross receipts for the current year. 
                  (3)	Where a business subject to the occupation tax for the calendar year has been conducted for only a part of the preceding year, the amount of gross receipts for such part shall be set forth in such return. Such return shall also show a figure putting the receipts for such part of a year on an annual basis, which figure shall bear the same ratio to the amount of gross receipts for such part year as the full year bears to such part. Such figure shall be used as the estimate of the gross receipts of the business for the current calendar year. 
                  (b)	Payment of occupation tax by newly established business. In the case of a business subject to occupation tax for a calendar year, which was not conducted for any period of time in the county in the preceding year, the owner, proprietor, manager or executive officer of the business liable for occupation tax shall estimate the gross volume of revenue from commencing date to the end of the calendar year.

                  (2)	If the amount of the occupation tax for the preceding year based on the return provided for in this section and on the rate of the tax provided for in this article exceeds the amount of occupation tax theretofore paid by such business based on the estimate filed pursuant to this section, the difference in such amount shall be due and payable by the taxpayer to the county on May 1 or the current year and delinquent if not paid on or before such date. 
                  (3)	If the amount of the occupation tax for the preceding year, based on the return provided for in this section and on the rate of tax provided for in this article, is less than the amount of occupation tax theretofore paid by such business based on the estimate filed pursuant to this section, the difference in such amount shall be refundable by the county to the taxpayer; or if such business continues to be conducted in the county during the current year, such difference in amount may be credited by the county on the amount of occupation tax to be paid to the county by such business for the current year. 
                  (d)	Returns confidential. 
                  (1)	Except as provided in O.C.G.A. § 48-13-15(c), information on gross receipts received by a business or practitioner of an occupation or profession provided to the county for the purpose of determining the amount of occupation tax for the business or practitioner is confidential and exempt from inspection or disclosure under O.C.G.A. title 50, ch. 18, art. 4. 
                  (2)	Violation of the confidentiality provision of subsection (a) of this section shall be unlawful and upon conviction shall be punished as a misdemeanor. 
                  (3)	Information on gross receipts received by a business or practitioner of an occupation or profession provided to the county for the purpose of determining the amount of occupation tax for the business or practitioner may be disclosed to the governing authority of another local government for occupation tax purposes or pursuant to court order or for the purpose of collection of occupation tax or prosecution for failure or refusal to pay occupation tax. 
                  (4)	In the event a taxpayer completes one or more forms in order to comply with the county's ordinance imposing either an occupation tax or a regulatory fee and any such form fails to disclose the Social Security number or the appropriate federal or state taxpayer identification number, or other identification numbers, the county shall report the omission in a timely manner to the state revenue commissioner.

Failure of submission of such books or records within 30 days shall be grounds for revocation of the occupation tax permit currently existing to do business in the county. If, after examination of the books or records, it is determined that a deficiency occurs as a result of under reporting, interest at the maximum rate allowed by law will be assessed for the period delinquent.

                  Editor's note—Ord. of 4-9-2012(05), which amended this article, had no section number or catchline in the first section of article III. Section number 82-85 was taken from the reserved sections and used to number this section, and a catchline was added, at the discretion of the editor.

                  [Sec. 82-85. - Revocation generally.] 
                  (a)	Cause for revocation. Any license issued for conducting a business pursuant to this article may be suspended or revoked in the event of any of the following: 
                  (1)	The licensee is found to have been engaged in any unlawful activity, including any act which would constitute a violation of a federal, state or county law, ordinance or resolution, and where such unlawful activity is such as to directly or indirectly affect the licensee's ability or qualification to conduct the business for which the license was issued; 
                  (2)	Whenever the state or other licensing governmental agency has revoked or suspended any required permit, license, or occupational registration; 
                  (3)	Whenever the licensee fails to commence doing business as set forth in its application within six months from the date the license was issued; 
                  (4)	Whenever the licensee fails to pay the annual license fees or any other fee or tax imposed by law or ordinance. 
                  (b)	Director's review and determination. In the event it is reported to the department that a licensee is or was engaged in any prohibited activity described in this section, an investigation shall be conducted by the department director. If the director's investigation reveals that there is reasonable belief that revocation or suspension of the license is justified the licensee shall be notified to appear before the director on a date certain and show cause why his license should not be revoked or suspended. The licensee may appear in person at such hearing and/or be represented by counsel. At this hearing, the licensee shall be presented with the facts that establish the reasonable belief and will then be given an opportunity to present any evidence the licensee wishes the director to consider. At the conclusion of the hearing, the director, based upon evidence available, shall enter a decision making a finding of fact and conclusion, which includes a statement that: 
                  (1)	The evidence does not support a finding that the licensee was engaged in any prohibited activity, and the issue is therefore terminated; or 
                  (2)	The evidence does support a finding that the licensee was engaged in prohibited activity, in which case the director may: 
                  a.	Issue a warning to the licensee;
                  b.	Suspend the license for a time certain;
                  c.	Revoke the license; and/or
                  d.	Take any other action regarding the licensee as the director deems just and appropriate under the circumstances. 
                  (c)	Appeal and hearing. Within ten days from the date of the director's decision, the licensee may appeal this decision by filing a written notice of appeal with the clerk of the board of commissioners. An administrative law judge appointed by the board of commissioners shall serve as the hearing officer for the appeal. The administrative law judge will be selected from a panel of attorneys approved by the board of commissioners. The notice of appeal shall supersede any suspension or revocation pending a determination following the appeal hearing. The hearing officer shall schedule a hearing within 45 days of receipt of the notice. Notice of the hearing shall be made by certified mail to the business address of the licensee. In the event the notice is returned undelivered, then notice shall be posted to any door of the licensee's place of business giving no less than seven days' notice of the hearing. The licensee may appear in person and/or be represented by counsel. The county shall be represented by an attorney selected by the county's chief staff attorney. Either party shall have the right to subpoena witnesses and present evidence at this hearing. Either party may request a continuance for good cause shown and the granting of such continuance shall be at the discretion of the hearing officer. 
                  (d)	Rules of evidence and conduct of appeal hearing. 
                  (1)	Irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded. The rules of evidence as applied in the trial of civil nonjury cases in the superior courts shall be followed. When necessary to ascertain facts not reasonably susceptible of proof under such rules, evidence not admissible there under may be admitted, except where precluded by statute, if it is of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent men in the conduct of their affairs or if it consists of a report of a type routinely submitted to and relied upon by a department of the county in the normal course of its business. The hearing officer shall give effect to the rules of privilege recognized by law. Objections to evidentiary offers may be made and shall be noted in the record. Subject to these requirements, when a hearing will be expedited and the interest of the parties will not be prejudiced substantially, any part of the evidence may be received in written form; 
                  (2)	Documentary evidence may be received in the form of copies or excerpts if the original is not readily available. Upon request, parties shall be given an opportunity to compare the copy with the original or have it established as documentary evidence according to the rules of evidence applicable to the superior courts of this state; 
                  (3)	A party may conduct such cross-examination as shall be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts; 
                  (4)	Official notice may be taken of judicially cognizable facts. In addition, official notice may be taken of generally recognized technical or scientific facts within the agency's specialized knowledge. Parties shall be notified either before or during the hearing, by reference in preliminary reports or otherwise, of the material noticed, including any staff memoranda or data, and they shall be afforded an opportunity to contest the material so noticed. The experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of a county employee may be utilized in the evaluation of the evidence; and 
                  (5)	Any appeal hearing may be conducted by utilizing remote telephonic communications if the record reflects that all parties have consented to the conduct of the hearing by use of such communications and that such procedure will not jeopardize the rights of any party to the hearing. 
                  (e)	Findings and determinations. Within ten days of the close of evidence the hearing officer shall complete a written finding of facts and order that: 
                  (1)	The evidence does not support a finding that the licensee was engaged in any prohibited activity, and the issue is therefore terminated; or 
                  (2)	The evidence does support a finding that the licensee was engaged in prohibited activity, in which case the hearing officer may: 
                  a.	Uphold the determination of the director;
                  b.	Issue a warning to the licensee;
                  c.	Suspend the license for a time certain;
                  d.	Revoke the license; and/or
                  e.	Take any other action regarding the licensee as the hearing officer deems just and appropriate under the circumstances. 
                  (f)	Appeal to superior court. The parties may appeal the final ruling of the hearing officer to the county superior court by writ of certiorari. 
                  (g)	The provisions of this section shall also apply to the holder of any permit or license authorizing the permittee or licensee to conduct business in the county. 
                  (Ord. of 4-9-2012(05), art. III)
                  Sec. 82-86. - Execution issued for delinquent occupation tax or fee. 
                  (a)	In addition to the other remedies provided for the levy and collection of the occupation tax and/or fee herein described, the department may cause an execution to issue for any tax and/or fee becoming delinquent and remaining unpaid. The execution shall be filed against any assets of the licensee and recorded on the general execution docket in the county superior court deed records. The execution shall include the following: 
                  (1)	The name, address and business location of the licensee;
                  (2)	The correct amount of the tax and/or fee assessed against the licensee, including a ten percent penalty applied after 90 days from the due date, and interest at the rate of 12 percent per annum from the date such tax and/or fee was due. 
                  (b)	The lien upon which the execution may issue shall become fixed on and the date such tax or fee was due. The execution shall be levied by the sheriff of the county upon the property of the licensee in the same manner as are ad valorem property tax executions. All proceedings relative thereto shall be in accordance with state laws, and the licensee in such execution shall have rights of defense by affidavit of illegality or as otherwise provided by the applicable state laws. When a nulla bona entry has been entered by the sheriff upon an execution issued by the department, the person against whom the entry was made shall be required to show cause before the director why his business license shall not be suspended or revoked until such delinquent tax and/or fee is paid in accordance with this section.

                  (1)	Any person who shall attempt to conduct business in the county without having first applied for and obtained a license provided for by this article; 
                  (2)	Any person who shall submit an application after the date prescribed by this article; or 
                  (3)	Any person who shall fail to pay any occupational tax or fee assessed by the department on or before March 31. 
                  (b)	Any person who has submitted false information in such person's application for a license shall be liable for a penalty in the amount of 20 percent of the occupational tax or fee owed for each calendar year, or portion thereof, plus an amount equal to the cost of such audits and field inspections deemed necessary by the department for its investigation. The penalty provided for in this paragraph shall be assessed in addition to any other penalty prescribed by this article. 
                  (c)	Any person who shall violate the provisions of this article shall place in jeopardy such person's privilege of doing business in the county. The department may, for just cause, suspend or revoke the license for any such person. 
                  (d)	Any person who shall violate the provisions of this article and conduct business without a license may have a case made against him in the magistrate court for doing business without a license, and as a misdemeanor shall, upon conviction, be fined as provided by law. Each separate day of doing business without a license shall be considered a separate offense.

                  Sec. 82-88. - Appeals. 
                  Any person who is of the opinion that such person's occupation tax and/or fee has been incorrectly assessed, or that such person's dominant line classification is incorrect, shall have the right to appeal to the board of commissioners; provided, that such person shall first have stated such position in writing to the department without receiving a satisfactory resolution.

                  (b)	If any operator liable for any amount under this article sells out his business or quits the business, his successors or assigns shall withhold a sufficient portion of the purchase price to cover such amount until the former owner produces a receipt from the community development department showing that he has been paid or a certificate stating that no amount is due. 
                  (c)	If the purchaser of a business fails to withhold the purchase price as required in subsection (b) of this section, he shall be personally liable for the payment of the amount required to be withheld by him to the extent of the purchase price. 
                  (d)	Whenever the amount of any tax or interest has been paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the board of commissioners under this article, it may be offset by the community development department. If the operator or person determines that he has overpaid or paid more than once, which fact has not been determined by the community development department, he will have three years from the date of payment to file claim in writing stating the specific ground upon which claim is founded. The claim shall be audited. If the claim is approved by the community development department, the excess amount paid to the board of commissioners may be credited on any amounts then due and payable from the person by whom it was paid, or his administrators or executors.

Due to size and weight, commercial vehicles often cannot easily maneuver or park on residential streets without causing damage to the road surface and hampering sight distance. Commercial vehicles, as a result of their size or appearance, including attached advertising, tools or equipment, are not in character with residential districts.

                  (5)	It is unlawful to park any commercial vehicle or any trailer, whether commercial or private, on the right-of-way of any residential street, driveway, front yard, side yard or rear yard, unless said commercial vehicle is making a delivery to residential property. This section shall not apply to vehicles, trailers, or equipment temporarily located within a construction area, provided such vehicles, trailers or equipment are used in connection with dwelling units or utilities under construction or repair within such construction area. Any parking allowed within the right-of-way pursuant to this subsection shall comply with all other rules, regulations and ordinances of the county. 
                  (6)	This article, having county-wide application, shall be enforceable without the necessity of a "NO PARKING" or "NO TRUCK PARKING" sign being posted within the right of way at or near the site of the violation.

The Magistrate Court of Butts County shall be authorized to determine upon proper hearing if a violation has occurred. Upon conviction of a first offense, the minimum fine shall be $150.00 plus court costs. Upon conviction of a second or subsequent offense within a one-year period, the minimum fine shall be $500.00 plus court costs. 
                  (b)	In the event the owner or person responsible for the commercial vehicle or trailer alleged to be in violation of this article fails to appear in court upon the issuance of a citation, or at any time a clear and present danger to public safety exists, the code enforcement officer shall have the authority to impound any vehicle found parked in a residential area in violation of this section. The expense of such action shall be charged against the property owner and shall become a lien on the property. 
                  (c)	At any trial upon a citation for a violation of this article the zoning classification for the location of the alleged offense may be established by evidence of a letter signed by the Zoning Administrator of Butts County attesting to the zoning district, and such evidence shall be admissible notwithstanding any hearsay objection.

                  Duly authorized agents and employees of the authority shall have access at all hours to the premises of the customer and/or property owner for the purposes of installing and removing the property of the authority, inspecting the authority's facilities, reading and testing meters, and repairing and maintaining the facilities of the authority. 
                  Sec. 90-36. - Fees for water service. 
                  (a)	Water rates. The rate schedule for water use is set by the authority from time to time. The current rate for water use is shown in Appendix C. However, water rates will not increase without thirty (30) days notice to the customer. Notice will be sufficiently given to the customer by a publication of the rate changes at least two (2) times in consecutive weeks in the official newspaper of Butts County prior to the rate increase. 
                  (b)	Minimum charge. All customers who pay a connection fee to the authority will be required to pay the minimum monthly charge as set by the authority commencing on the next billing date after the meter is set and water is available for consumption. Customers who are not using water may have their meter declared inactive to avoid payment of the minimum charge each month, but will be required to pay a re-activation fee as per section 90-37.b.2 to begin using water again. 
                  (c)	Deposits. 
                  (1)	Setting of deposit fees. The authority is authorized to establish security deposit fees to be paid for water and sewer service and to collect such fees upon application for service and at such other times as the authority may determine to be necessary. Notice will be sufficiently given to the customer by a publication of deposit fee changes at least two (2) times in consecutive weeks in the official newspaper of Butts County prior to the increase. 
                  (2)	Refund of deposits. When a customer moves out of a property, the deposit, less any amount owed, will be refunded to the customer. Also, individual security deposits are also refunded to customers with an excellent payment history after 24 months on the system. Payment history is considered excellent if the customer has had no more than one late penalty during the 24 months. If the customer receives a second late payment penalty during this time frame, the 24 month period will begin again from the date of the last penalty. No interest will apply. 
                  (3)	Exemption from deposit. Customers who have been on the authority's system for 24 months or longer, and who have excellent payment history, may be exempted from paying a security deposit if moving from one address to another, or if adding another unit to the system. 
                  (4)	Requirement of deposit from landlords under certain circumstances. When rental property service is in the name of the renter and if: a. the property is vacated, b. a new tenant does not immediately move in, and c. the service is shut off at the meter, the property owner will be responsible for the minimum monthly bill, but will not be required to make a deposit. If service is not shut off at the meter, a regular deposit will be required from the property owner. 
                  (d)	Tap fees. Tap fees are applied when a new tap must be made in the water main to make the service connection. Tap fees are set by the authority and charged according to the schedule shown in Appendix B. 
                  (e)	Meter fees. Meter fees are applied in developments where the developer has previously installed water taps and only a meter installation is required to make the service connection. Meter fees are set by the authority and charged according to the schedule shown in Appendix B. 
                  (f)	Payment plans. In cases of extreme financial hardship, the authority manager may give approval for a customer to pay required connection fees over time. The customer must provide documentation of financial need. The maximum extension allowed will be twenty-five percent down with the balance paid in equal payments over six months. 
                  (g)	Capital recovery fees. Any person or corporation who ties onto the water system's established service area shall pay a Capital Recovery Fee in the manner and amount established by this ordinance. In all cases, the Capital Recovery Fee must be paid prior to authorization of connection to the water system area in the form of an executed Tap Agreement. 
                  (1)	Computation of capital recovery fee. The capital recovery fee assessment shall be in accordance with the fee schedule shown in Appendix A or as otherwise established pursuant to applicable procedures of this ordinance. Any Capital Recovery Fee imposed shall not exceed a project's proportionate share of the cost of system improvements, shall be calculated on the basis of the establishment of service areas, and shall be calculated on the basis of levels of service for public facilities that are the same for existing development as for new growth and development. 
                  (2)	Individual fee determination 
                  a.	Petition allowed. An applicant for development approval may petition the authority for an individual fee determination of Capital Recovery Fees due for a project. 
                  b.	Individual fee calculation study. An applicant electing an individual fee determination shall submit an Individual Fee Calculation Study for the development activity for which service is sought. The Individual Fee Calculation Study shall follow the methodology and format of the current "Water Capital Recovery Fee Report" or, subject to prior approval of the Administrator, such other professionally accepted methodology that identifies a project's proportionate share. The applicant shall attend a pre-application meeting with the Administrator, and no agreement or understanding in regard to data assumptions or methodology shall be binding upon the authority unless specifically agreed to by the authority in writing. The documentation submitted shall show the basis upon which the Individual Fee Calculation was made. 
                  c.	Determination time frame. The Administrator shall provide the applicant with the Individual Fee Determination within thirty (30) days after presentation of the Individual Fee Calculation Study. 
                  (3)	Changes to proposed development. Not withstanding the issuance of any such certification, any changes in or additions to the proposed development activity different from the development activity identified in the original application shall be subject to increased or additional Capital Recovery Fees to the extent that such changes or additions would have resulted in the determination of a different fee than that assessed from the original application. The additional Capital Recovery Fees shall be based upon the Capital Recovery Fee Schedule in effect at the time of any such change or addition. 
                  (4)	Payment of capital recovery fees. 
                  a.	Payment required prior to water tap/meter agreement. Any persons required to pay Capital Recovery Fees pursuant to this ordinance shall pay such fees to the authority prior to the issuance of an approved water tap/meter agreement unless the authority has previously approved a Private Development Agreement providing for an alternative method of payment. 
                  b.	Additional payment required due to alteration or expansion. Any persons who engage in an alteration or expansion of an existing building or use of land already on the water system, which results in an additional water demand will be required to pay additional assessed Capital Recovery Fees prior to the issuance of a building permit. 
                  c.	Fees to be deposited into trust fund. All funds collected pursuant to this ordinance shall be properly identified by the Capital Recovery Fee Service Area from which it was collected and promptly transferred for deposit into the appropriate Capital Recovery Fee Trust Fund to be held in separate accounts as provided for in Sec. 90-36.g.10 (Capital Recovery Fee Trust Funds Established) of this ordinance.

Funds shall be expended in the order in which they are collected. 
                  b.	Annual report required. Each fiscal year, the authority's general manager shall present to the authority's board of directors an annual report describing the amount of Capital Recovery Fees collected, encumbered and used during the preceding year.

                  1.	A person claiming Credits under a Private Development Agreement shall submit to the Administrator a project description in sufficient detail to allow the Administrator to prepare an engineering and construction cost estimate. A person proposing credit for system improvements shall present cost estimates and property appraisals prepared by duly licensed and qualified professionals to be used by the Administrator in determining the amount of the credit. All construction must be carried out in accordance with applicable authority, county, or state development and design standards. A person seeking Credits under a Private Development Agreement for land dedication shall present the Administrator with property appraisals prepared by qualified professionals and a certified copy of the most recent assessment of the property for tax purposes. However, the authority retains the right to determine the amount to be credited by preparing engineering and construction cost estimates and/or property appraisals for those improvements. 
                  2.	Credits must be claimed at the time of the application for water service. Any credit not so claimed shall not be available as to any Capital Recovery Fee owed with respect to water service to that particular property. 
                  3.	In the event that a developer contracts with the authority to construct, fund, or contribute System Improvements so that the amount of the Credit created by such construction, funding or contribution is in excess of a particular Capital Recovery Fee which would have been otherwise due and owing, the developer shall be reimbursed for such excess contribution, funding, or contribution from the pool of Capital Recovery Fees paid by the development projects located in the service area which benefit by such improvements. 
                  4.	Security in the form of a performance bond, or escrow agreement shall be posted with the authority, made payable to the authority in the amount approved by the Administrator equal to one hundred ten percent (110%) of the full cost of the construction of such improvements. If a facility construction project will not be constructed within one (1) year of acceptance of the offer by the authority, the amount of the security shall be increased by ten percent (10%) compounded, for each year of the life of the security. The security shall be reviewed and approved by the authority's attorney prior to the acceptance of the security by the authority. 
                  c.	Credit certificate.

A person claiming exemptions(s) pursuant to section 90-36.g.7a above shall submit to the Administrator information and documentation sufficient to permit the Administrator to determine whether such exemption claimed is proper, and, if so, the extent of such exemption. 
                  c.	Time for exemption application. Exemptions must be applied for at the time of the application for a building permit except in the case of a private development agreement. Any exemptions not so applied for shall be deemed waived. 
                  (8)	Refunds. Refunds of impact fees shall be made only in the following instances and in the following manner: 
                  a.	Capacity available but service denied.

                  The area does not include properties served by existing county roads that do not have access to water service. However, once water service from the authority has been available for connection on any of those roads for a period of thirty days, said roads will be included in the service area. 
                  The service area is expected to expand in the future to include any and all additional area served by the water system, with no separate service areas anticipated to be established. 
                  (10)	Water capital recovery fee trust fund established.

                  (11)	Review of fee structure. The Capital Recovery Fee structure shall be reviewed by the authority's board of directors annually. The failure to review such structure shall not invalidate this ordinance. 
                  (12)	Administrative appeals. 
                  a.	Appealable items. Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Administrator with respect to any of the following determinations shall have the right to appeal to the authority's board of directors: (a) the imposition of a Capital Recovery Fee, (b) the amount of a Capital Recovery Fee, (c) the entitlement to and/or the amount of credits to a Capital Recovery Fee, (d) the entitlement to an exemption from a Capital Recovery Fee, and (e) the entitlement to and/or the amount of a refund of a Capital Recovery Fee.

                  Sec. 90-37. - Meter designations and readings. 
                  (a)	Reading schedule. The water meter serving the customer's property shall be read on a monthly basis and official records of each reading thereof shall be kept for a minimum period of one (1) year. 
                  (b)	Meter designation. Water meters shall be classified as either "active meters", "inactive meters", and "canceled meters". These designations are defined as follows: 
                  (1)	Active meters. "Active meters" are defined as meters that are in normal use. All active meters will be charged on a monthly basis. 
                  (2)	Inactive meters. "Inactive meters" are defined as meters that are installed where the customer has notified the authority in writing to temporarily terminate service. When it receives such written request, the authority will seal the meter and declare the meter an inactive meter. When no responsible party is available to request inactive meter designation for the customer, the authority may declare the meter inactive. If a customer desires to obtain water services after the meter has been declared inactive, the customer shall pay a re-connection fee as set in the prevailing fee schedule of the authority. In addition, the customer must pay any previous unpaid bills which that customer had through the authority's services prior to obtaining any additional service from the authority. Once the connection fee and any past due bills have been paid, the meter will be re-classified as an active meter as defined above. 
                  (3)	Canceled meters. Canceled meters are defined as meters that have not been in use where the customer has notified the authority that no further water service from the authority is desired. The authority may, on its own initiative, declare a meter canceled when water has not been used for a period of twelve (12) months or longer. If a meter is declared a canceled meter, the meter will be removed and the connection sealed. A customer desiring re-connection of a canceled meter shall pay the capital recovery fee, meter fee, and security deposit that is in effect as of the date of application. 
                  Sec. 90-38. - Billings and collections. 
                  (a)	Payment. The customer shall pay promptly on a monthly basis all water registered by the meter serving said property at the rates set by the authority from time to time, which shall include water used, water wasted, or leakage, except for the water that may be traced by the authority to the authority's system. Property owners shall be responsible for any unpaid water bills left by tenants. 
                  (b)	Billing Schedule. The authority is authorized to establish billing schedules for payment of water and sewer service. 
                  (c)	Billing errors. If the customer believes his/her bill to be in error, this claim must be presented to the authority, or its billing agent, before the bill becomes due. Such claim, if made after the bill has become delinquent, shall not be effective in preventing discontinuance of service as heretofore provided. The customer may pay such bill under protest and said payment shall not prejudice his claim. Any customer who fails to notify the authority in writing within 30 days after the date of said bill of any irregularities or errors that may be in said bill shall waive any right or claim for correction or refund under said bill. 
                  (d)	Meter failure. If the seal of a meter is broken by any person other than the authority's representative, or if the meter fails to register correctly, or is stopped for any cause, the customer shall pay an amount which is the average for the three (3) previous months water usage. 
                  (e)	Meter testing. The authority will carry out a regular program of meter testing and replacement. In addition, water meters will be tested at the request of the customer. 
                  If the meter is found to be reading at a higher rate than actual flow, no charge will be made. However, if the meter is found to be reading at 101.5% or less, the customer will be required to pay a service fee to be set by the authority. 
                  (f)	Meter reading re-checks. The authority may establish and charge a fee for meter reading re-checks except that no fee will be charged for re-checks requested by the customer when the original reading shown appears to have been incorrect. 
                  (g)	Credit for excessive leakages. In cases where water is shown to have leaked through a customer's private water piping and has caused billing which is over 20,000 in excess of that customer's average monthly usage over the previous twelve months, the customer will be required to pay only the authority's current cost of water plant operation per 1000 gallons for said usage over 20,000 gallons over the average. In cases of extremely high bills due to such leaks, the authority manager may set up a payment schedule for the customer. 
                  (h)	Returned check fee. Customers who make payments with checks which are not covered by sufficient funds will be charged a "returned check fee" as set by the authority. When a customer has written two (2) checks which have been returned for insufficient funds, the authority will accept only cash or money orders for future payment as long as the account remains in that customer's name. This is regardless of who makes the payment on the account. 
                  (i)	Water bill payment extensions. Customers will be allowed a maximum of two time extensions per year for payment of water bill. This applies to late payment penalties, warning fees, and reconnect fees. 
                  In Witness Whereof, the partners hereto, acting under the authority of their respective governing bodies, have caused this Contract to be duly executed in two (2) counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original. 
                  Sec. 90-39. - Suspension of services. 
                  (a)	Termination with notice. Service may be terminated at the request of the customer. Service may also be terminated for nonpayment of water and/or sewer charges according to the adopted policies of the authority. In such cases, the authority will attempt to notify the customer of the impending service termination in advance to allow for a settling of accounts prior to the termination. 
                  (b)	Termination without notice. The authority reserves the right to discontinue its service without notice for the following reasons: 
                  (1)	Prevention of fraud or abuse;
                  (2)	Customer's willful disregard of the authority's adopted policies;
                  (3)	Emergency repairs;
                  (4)	Insufficiency of water supply due to circumstances beyond the authority's control;
                  (5)	Legal processes;
                  (6)	Direction of public authorities; and
                  (7)	Strike, riot, fire, flood, unavoidable accident, actions of others, or acts of God.
                  (c)	Other terminations.

                  Sec. 90-40. - Allocation of water services. 
                  The authority shall have the right from time to time, if necessary, to restrict water to the customer under specific rules and regulations that are contained in its Water Conservation Plan and Drought Contingency Plan, or that may be adopter hereafter by the authority. 
                  The authority shall also restrict water to the customer under the direction and rules of the Environmental Protection Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. 
                  Sec. 90-41. - Line extensions. 
                  (a)	authority's responsibility for line extension. When public funds are available for line extensions, the authority will carry out construction in the order established in a priority road list adopted by the authority. This list shall be based upon a balance of sound engineering and service to a maximum customer base. A current road priority list for line extensions on roads unincorporated Butts County shall be maintained by the authority and made available to the public. 
                  (b)	Plans and specifications for construction of water lines. The authority shall have the right to specify the requirements, plans, and specifications for construction of water lines in unincorporated Butts County. All water lines constructed, or paid for, by the authority, any municipality, utility, contractor, consumer, owner, or developer shall be constructed according to the plans and specifications established by the authority for the construction of water lines in Butts County. 
                  No water line shall be covered without first being inspected and approved by the authority. No line shall be put into service without being approved by the authority for disinfection and pressure tightness. 
                  (c)	Extensions not initiated by the authority. 
                  (1)	Water line extensions to existing residential, industrial, and commercial development. The authority recognizes that areas of pre-existing development may have property owners who desire water service prior to public funds being available for construction. Therefore, on existing public roads, the authority will provide labor and equipment at no charge for line extensions to existing development under the following conditions: 
                  a.	Right-of-way. Water lines may only be extended along county roads which have sufficient dedicated right-of-way. 
                  b.	Payment for design, materials, blasting. The customer will be required to pay to the authority, prior to the commencement of construction, an amount sufficient to pay for all costs associated with design and materials that are required to build the proposed line and to extend the authority's water main from the existing water main which has sufficient size to service the proposed line. 
                  The cost of the project will be determined by the authority. The authority will provide an initial estimate of cost to the interested parties at no charge. It is immaterial whether the costs for the line are shared equally by the customers or whether one or more property owners or customers pays for the water line extension. 
                  In the event that it becomes apparent to the authority that construction of said line will cost more than the original estimated cost, the authority may terminate work until such time as adequate funds have been placed with the authority. 
                  (2)	Authority consideration. The authority's board of directors will consider an application from an existing development, or group of owners of existing development, when the following are provided: 
                  a.	Documentation of sufficient right of way and/or easements as required by the county and the authority. 
                  b.	A petition of property owners to be served with the signature of all participants, the number of connections to be made for each participant, and an indication of the cost to be borne by each participant. 
                  c.	Deposit of the estimated funds for design, materials, and any anticipated blasting.
                  d.	Deposit of the required connection fees for individual customers.
                  If the request is approved by the authority board, an estimated date of completion will be given to the customer, but a date of completion cannot be guaranteed because of changes in work schedule, weather conditions, equipment breakdown, delays in delivery of materials, improvement of the right of way, or other unpredictable circumstances. 
                  (3)	Ownership of lines. All water lines built will become the property of the authority. 
                  (4)	Unused funds. Any unused funds provided by the property owners for line construction will be reimbursed by the authority upon completion of construction. 
                  (d)	Water line extensions to serve new residential, commercial, and industrial development. 
                  (1)	Developer responsible for all costs of extension. This section applies inside new residential subdivisions, industrial sites, and commercial sites and to necessary extensions along existing public roads to reach those sites. 
                  The owner of any new development will be required to pay for labor, materials, design and all other costs of water line extension. At the option of the authority, construction of extensions to and within new development may be done by the authority or by a qualified contractor working for the developer. In any case, line construction must adhere strictly to adopted authority specifications. 
                  (2)	Authority consideration. Extensions to new development will be considered under the following conditions: 
                  a.	Sufficient dedicated right-of-way must be available along public roads required to access the development. 
                  b.	The developer must provide a letter from the Butts County Community Services Department that the property has been approved for the proposed use according to the zoning and development regulations of Butts County. 
                  c.	The developer must provide the authority with three (3) copies of a plat or accurate drawing of the property to be served at a format and scale that meets the authority's specifications. Said plats or drawings shall contain the following information: 
                  1.	Location of the closest existing water line of the authority which is of sufficient size to serve the property; 
                  2.	Location of the existing and proposed roads to serve the property;
                  3.	Exact size, material, and footage of water line that will have to be installed in order to serve the property; 
                  4.	Location of all water lines and appurtenances to be constructed in the area to be developed; and 
                  5.	Documentation that lines and appurtenances have been sized to meet the specifications the county and the authority for customer demand and fire flows. 
                  d.	The developer must document financial ability to pay the cost of construction. If the construction will be provided by the authority, the total cost of the project, as estimated by the authority, must be paid to the authority. 
                  A letter of credit signed by the president of an accredited bank in the State of Georgia will be acceptable in lieu of cash. In the event that it becomes apparent to the authority that construction of said lines will cost more than the original estimated cost, the authority may terminate work until such time as adequate funds have been placed with the authority, or a revised letter of credit with an adequate figure is received. 
                  (3)	Construction by authority. Water lines will only be placed within easements established for such purposes, or within right of way lines of streets and roads which have been certified as being part of the public road system of Butts County. An estimated date of completion cannot be guaranteed because of changes in work schedule, weather conditions, equipment breakdown, delays in delivery of materials, improvement of the right of way, or other unpredictable circumstances. 
                  All water lines built are the property of the authority. 
                  Any unused funds deposited by the Developer for the line construction will be reimbursed by the authority upon commencement of water services. 
                  (4)	Construction by developer. Lines will normally be allowed to be constructed by the Developer only within the development itself. 
                  During construction, the authority will inspect work as necessary. 
                  Upon completion of construction by the developer, but prior to the initiation of water service the following must be done:

The authority will conduct a final comprehensive inspection of the water infrastructure once the facility has been in service between eleven (11) and twelve (12) months. The developer will be responsible for any corrections and listed noted through that time. 
                  d.	The developer must furnish three (3) copies of as-built water lines and appurtenances in the size and format specified by the authority. 
                  e.	The developer must execute an affidavit prescribed by the authority stating that the cost of all labor and materials has been paid accompanied by copies of all invoices. 
                  (e)	Construction by municipalities or other water utilities in unincorporated Butts County. 
                  (1)	Approval. Water line construction by municipalities or other water utilities within unincorporated Butts County must adhere strictly to adopted authority specifications and must be approved by the authority's board of directors prior to construction. 
                  In cases of such extensions, the developer of said extensions must provide the authority with three (3) copies of a plat or accurate drawing of the property to be served. Said plats or drawings shall contain the following information:

                  e.	Documentation that lines and appurtenances have been sized to meet the specifications the county and the authority for customer demand and fire flows. 
                  The authority is authorized to assess a fee for plan approval. 
                  (2)	As-Built documentation. Upon completion of construction, but prior to the initiation of water service, documentation that the extension has been tested for pressure, flow, and water quality must be provided to the authority. 
                  The municipality installing water infrastructure in unincorporated Butts County must furnish three (3) copies of as-built water lines and appurtenances in the size and format specified by the authority. 
                  (f)	Permit from Butts County board of commissioners.
