         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of Union County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the commissioner. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Index 
                  The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments

                  The authority shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest thereof, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the state.

All such bonds shall be signed by the chairman of the authority and the official seal of the authority shall be affixed thereto and attached by the secretary of the authority and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the signature or facsimile signature of the chairman of the authority. Any coupon may bear the facsimile signature of the chairman of the authority.

                  The authority may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interests of the authority, but no such sale shall be made at a price so low as to require the payment of interest on the money received therefor at more than six percent per annum, computed with relation to the absolute maturity of the bonds in accordance with standard tables of bond values, excluding, however, from such computation, the amount of any premium to be paid on redemption of any bond prior to maturity. 
                  Section 11. - Same—Proceeds of bonds. 
                  The proceeds of such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project or projects, and unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds, or in the trust indenture, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of any deficit which, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds, or in the trust indenture, shall be deemed to be of the same, and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund, without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purpose. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such bonds are issued, the surplus shall be paid into the fund, hereinafter provided, for the payment of principal and interest of such bonds. 
                  Section 12. - Same—Interim receipts and certificates or temporary bonds.

In the discretion of the authority, revenue bonds of a single issue may be issued for the purpose of any particular project. Any resolution, providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this act shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special or adjourned meeting of the authority by a majority of its members. 
                  Section 15. - Same—Credit not pledged. 
                  Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of Union County or a pledge of the faith and credit of said county, but such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund hereinafter provided for, and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly or contingently obligate the said county to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor, or to make any appropriation for the payment, and all such bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this section. 
                  Section 16. - Same—Trust indenture as security. 
                  In the discretion of the authority, any issuance of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues and earnings to be received by the authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair and insurance of the project, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all monies, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor, and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depositary of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other monies be satisfactory to such purchases, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depositary and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and indentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project affected by such indenture. 
                  Section 17. - Same—To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid. 
                  The authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person, who, or any agency, bank or trust company which shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as this act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide. 
                  Section 18. - Same—Sinking funds. 
                  The revenues, fees, toll and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such have been issued, unless otherwise pledged and allocated by the authority to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds of the authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust instrument may provide, and such funds not pledged, from whatever source received, which said pledge may include funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture, into a sinking fund which said sinking fund shall be pledged to and charged with the payments of (1) the interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due, (2) the principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due, (3) the necessary charges of paying agents for paying principal and (4) any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as hereinabove provided. The use and disposition of such sinking funds shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be a fund for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, surplus monies in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be cancelled and shall not again be issued. 
                  Section 19. - Same—Remedies of bondholders. 
                  Any holder of revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit action, mandamus or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Georgia, or granted hereunder, or under such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this act or by such resolution or trust indenture, to be performed by the authority, or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished. 
                  Section 20. - Same—Refunding bonds. 
                  The authority is hereby authorized to provide by resolution for the issue of revenue refunding bonds of the authority for the purpose of refunding any revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act and then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon. The issuance of such revenue refunding bonds, the maturities and all other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof and the duties of the authority in respect to the same, shall be governed by the foregoing provisions of this act insofar as the same may be applicable.

The provisions of this act shall be for the benefit of the authority and the holders of any such bonds, and upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions hereof, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds. 
                  Section 24. - Monies received considered trust funds. 
                  All monies received pursuant to the authority of this act, whether as proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds, as grants or other contributions, or as revenues, fees and earnings, shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided in this act. 
                  Section 25. - Purpose of the authority. 
                  Without limiting the generality of any provisions of this act, the general purpose of the authority is declared to be that of acquiring an adequate source of water supply, treatment of such water, and thereafter the distribution of same to Coosa water system, and the various townships and citizens in said county and environs, including adjoining counties and municipalities located therein, and further for the general purpose of gathering and treatment of waste, both individual and industrial, but such general purpose shall not restrict the authority from selling and delivering water direct to consumers in those areas where there does not now exist water distribution systems or furnishing sewer facilities to such consumers and areas where neither any county nor municipality deems it desirable or feasible to furnish water in such locality. The authority shall also have the authority, where it deems it feasible, to sell its products and services to consumers, governmental agencies or governmental instrumentalities of adjoining states, provided the laws of the adjoining state do not prohibit or tax said activity. 
                  Section 26. - Rates, charges and revenues; use.

                  Section 27. - Rules and regulations for operation of projects. 
                  It shall be the duty of the authority to prescribe rules and regulations for the operation of the project or projects constructed under the provisions of this act, including the basis on which water and sewer service and facilities shall be furnished. 
                  Section 28. - Powers declared supplemental and additional. 
                  The foregoing sections of this act shall be deemed to provide an additional and alternative method for the doing of the things authorized thereby and shall be regarded as supplemental and additional to powers conferred by other laws, and shall not be regarded as in derogation of any powers now existing. 
                  Section 29. - Liberal construction of act. 
                  This act, being for the welfare of various political subdivisions of the state and its inhabitants, shall be liberally construed to effect the purposes thereof. 
                  Section 30. - Effect of partial invalidity of act. 
                  The provisions of this act are severable, and if any of its provisions shall be held unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, the decision of such court shall not affect or impair any of the remaining provisions. 
                  Section 31. - Repeal. 
                  This act does not in any way take from Union County or any municipality located therein or any adjoining county the authority to own, operate and maintain water or sewer systems, or issue revenue certificates as is provided by the Revenue Certificate Law of Georgia. All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this act are hereby repealed.

                  The proceeds of such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project or projects, and unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds, or in the trust indenture, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of any deficit which, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds, or in the trust indenture, shall be deemed to be of the same, and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund, without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purpose. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such bonds are issued, the surplus shall be paid into the fund, hereinafter provided, for the payment of principal and interest of such bonds.

In the discretion of the authority, revenue bonds of a single issue may be issued for the purpose of any particular project. Any resolution, providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this act shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special or adjourned meeting of the authority by a majority of its members. 
                  Section 15. - Same—Credit not pledged. 
                  Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of Union County or a pledge of the faith and credit of said county, but such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund hereinafter provided for, and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly or contingently obligate the said county to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor, or to make any appropriation for the payment, and all such bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this section. 
                  Section 16. - Same—Trust indenture as security. 
                  In the discretion of the authority, any issuance of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues and earnings to be received by the authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair and insurance of the project, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all monies, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor, and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depositary of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other monies be satisfactory to such purchases, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depositary and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and indentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project affected by such indenture. 
                  Section 17. - Same—To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid. 
                  The authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person, who, or any agency, bank or trust company which shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as this act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide. 
                  Section 18. - Same—Sinking funds. 
                  The revenues, fees, toll and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such have been issued, unless otherwise pledged and allocated by the authority to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds of the authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust instrument may provide, and such funds not pledged, from whatever source received, which said pledge may include funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture, into a sinking fund which said sinking fund shall be pledged to and charged with the payments of (1) the interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due, (2) the principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due, (3) the necessary charges of paying agents for paying principal and (4) any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as hereinabove provided. The use and disposition of such sinking funds shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be a fund for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, surplus monies in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be cancelled and shall not again be issued. 
                  Section 19. - Same—Remedies of bondholders. 
                  Any holder of revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit action, mandamus or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Georgia, or granted hereunder, or under such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this act or by such resolution or trust indenture, to be performed by the authority, or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished. 
                  Section 20. - Same—Refunding bonds. 
                  The authority is hereby authorized to provide by resolution for the issue of revenue refunding bonds of the authority for the purpose of refunding any revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act and then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon. The issuance of such revenue refunding bonds, the maturities and all other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof and the duties of the authority in respect to the same, shall be governed by the foregoing provisions of this act insofar as the same may be applicable. 
                  Section 21. - Same—Venue and jurisdiction. 
                  Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this act or any suit or action against such authority shall be brought in the Superior Court of Union County, Georgia, and any action pertaining to validation of any bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall likewise be brought in said court which shall have exclusive, original jurisdiction of such actions. 
                  Section 22. - Same—Validation. 
                  Bonds of the authority shall be confirmed and validated in accordance with the procedure of the Revenue Certificate Law of 1937, as amended. The petition for validation shall also make party defendant to such action any municipality, county, authority, subdivision or instrumentality of the State of Georgia which has contracted with the authority for services and facilities of the water system for which bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated, and such municipality, county, authority, subdivision or instrumentality shall be required to show cause, if any, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the Court and the validity of the terms thereof be determined and the contract or contracts adjudicated as security for the payment of any such bonds of the authority. The bonds, when validated, and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds, against the authority issuing the same, and any municipality, county, authority, subdivision or instrumentality contracting with the said Notla Water Authority. 
                  Section 23. - Same—Interest of bondholders protected. 
                  While any of the bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties or existence of said authority or of its officers, employees or agents, shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of such bonds, and no other entity, department, agency or authority will be created which will compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the rights and interests of the holders of such bonds, nor will the state itself so compete with the authority. The provisions of this act shall be for the benefit of the authority and the holders of any such bonds, and upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions hereof, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds. 
                  Section 24. - Monies received considered trust funds. 
                  All monies received pursuant to the authority of this act, whether as proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds, as grants or other contributions, or as revenues, fees and earnings, shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided in this act. 
                  Section 25. - Purpose of the authority. 
                  Without limiting the generality of any provisions of this act, the general purpose of the authority is declared to be that of acquiring an adequate source of water supply, treatment of such water, and thereafter the distribution of same to Notla water system, and the various townships and citizens in said county and environs, including adjoining counties and municipalities located therein, and further for the general purpose of gathering and treatment of waste, both individual and industrial, but such general purpose shall not restrict the authority from selling and delivering water direct to consumers in those areas where there does not now exist water distribution systems or furnishing sewer facilities to such consumers and areas where neither any county nor municipality deems it desirable or feasible to furnish water in such locality. The authority shall also have the authority, where it deems it feasible, to sell its products and services to consumers, governmental agencies or governmental instrumentalities of adjoining states, provided the laws of the adjoining state do not prohibit or tax said activity. 
                  Section 26. - Rates, charges and revenues; use. 
                  The authority is hereby authorized to prescribe and fix and collect rates, fees, tolls or charges, and to revise from time to time and collect such rates, fees, tolls or charges, for the services, facilities or commodities furnished, and in anticipation of the collection of the revenues of such undertaking or project, to issue revenue bonds as herein provided to finance, in whole or in part, the cost of the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, improvement, betterment or extension of the water and sewer utility system, and to pledge to the punctual payment of said bonds and interest thereon, all or any part of the revenues of such undertaking or project, including the revenues of improvements, betterments or extensions thereto thereafter made. 
                  Section 27. - Rules and regulations for operation of projects. 
                  It shall be the duty of the authority to prescribe rules and regulations for the operation of the project or projects constructed under the provisions of this act, including the basis on which water and sewer service and facilities shall be furnished. 
                  Section 28. - Powers declared supplemental and additional. 
                  The foregoing sections of this act shall be deemed to provide an additional and alternative method for the doing of the things authorized thereby and shall be regarded as supplemental and additional to powers conferred by other laws, and shall not be regarded as in derogation of any powers now existing. 
                  Section 29. - Liberal construction of act. 
                  This act, being for the welfare of various political subdivisions of the state and its inhabitants, shall be liberally construed to effect the purposes thereof. 
                  Section 30. - Effect of partial invalidity of act. 
                  The provisions of this act are severable, and if any of its provisions shall be held unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, the decision of such court shall not affect or impair any of the remaining provisions. 
                  Section 31. - Repeal. 
                  This act does not in any way take from Union County or any municipality located therein or any adjoining county the authority to own, operate and maintain water or sewer systems, or issue revenue certificates as is provided by the Revenue Certificate Law of Georgia. All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this act are hereby repealed.

                  Section 4. - Powers.

If the authority shall deem it expedient to construct any project on any other lands the title to which shall then be in the State of Georgia, the governor is authorized to convey, for and in behalf of the state, title to such lands to the authority upon payment of the reasonable value of such lands to the state treasurer for the credit of the general fund of the state.

The principal and interest of such revenue bonds shall be payable solely from the special fund provided for such payment. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates not exceeding nine percent per annum, payable at such time or times, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding 40 years from their date or dates, or at such times exceeding 40 years as may hereafter be authorized by the bonding laws of the State of Georgia, shall be payable in such medium of payment as to both principal and interest as may be redeemable before maturity, at the option of the authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority in the resolution for the issuance of bonds.

                  Section 7. - Same—Signatures; seal. 
                  In case any officer whose signature shall appear on any bonds, or whose facsimile signature shall appear on any coupon, shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. All such bonds shall be signed by the chairman of the authority and the official seal of the authority shall be fixed thereto and attached by the secretary of the authority and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the signature or facsimile signature of the chairman of the authority. Any coupon may bear the facsimile signature of such persons and any bond may be signed, sealed, and attested on behalf of the authority by such persons as at the actual time of the execution of such bonds shall be duly authorized or hold the proper office, although at the date of such bonds such persons may not have been so authorized or shall not have held such office.

                  The authority may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interests of the authority, but no such sale shall be made at a price so low as to require the payment of interest on the money received therefor at more than nine percent per annum, computed with relation to the absolute maturity of the bonds in accordance with standard tables of bond values, excluding, however, from such computation, the amount of any premium to be paid on redemption of any bond prior to maturity. 
                  Section 10. - Same—Proceeds of bonds. 
                  The proceeds of such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project or projects, and unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds, or in the trust indenture, additional bonds may in like manner be issued, to provide the amount of any deficit, which, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds, or in the trust indenture, shall be deemed to be of the same, and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund, without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purpose. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such bonds are issued, the surplus shall be paid into the fund, hereinafter provided, for the payment of principal and interest of such bonds. 
                  Section 11. - Same—Interim receipts and certificates of temporary bonds. 
                  Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts, interim certificates or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter.

                  The authority may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost. 
                  Section 13. - Same—Conditions precedent to issuance; object of issuance. 
                  Such revenue bonds may be issued without any other proceedings, or the happening of any conditions or things other than those proceedings, conditions and things which are specified or required by this act. In the discretion of the authority, revenue bonds of a single issue may be issued for the purpose of any particular project. Any resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this act shall become effective immediately upon its passage and shall be published in the official newspaper for Union County one time within a week of its being adopted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special or adjourned meeting of the authority by a majority of its members. 
                  Section 14. - Same—Credit not pledged. 
                  Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of Union County or a pledge of the faith and credit of said county, but such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund hereinafter provided for, and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly or contingently obligate the said county to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor, or to make any appropriation for the payment, and all such bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this section. 
                  Section 15. - Same—Trust indenture as security. 
                  In the discretion of the authority, any issuance of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues and earnings to be received by the authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair and insurance of the project, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor, and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project affected by such indenture. 
                  Section 16. - Same—To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid. 
                  The authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person, who, or any agency, bank or trust company which, shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as this act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide. 
                  Section 17. - Same—Sinking funds. 
                  The revenues, fees, tolls and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such have been issued, unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the authority to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds of the authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust instrument may provide, and such funds not pledged, from whatever source received, which said pledge may include funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture, into a sinking fund, which said sinking fund shall be pledged to and charged with the payments of (1) the interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due, (2) the principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due, (3) the necessary charges of paying agents for paying principal and interest, and (4) any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as hereinabove provided. The use and disposition of such sinking funds shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be a fund for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, surplus moneys in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be canceled and shall not again be issued. 
                  Section 18. - Same—Remedies of bondholders. 
                  Any holder of revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act, or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Georgia, or granted hereunder, or under such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this act or by such resolution or trust indenture to be performed by the authority, or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished. 
                  Section 19. - Same—Refunding bonds. 
                  The authority is authorized to provide by resolution for the issue of revenue refunding bonds of the authority for the purpose of refunding any revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act and then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon. The issuance of such revenue refunding bonds, the maturities and all other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof and the duties of the authority in respect to the same shall be governed by the foregoing provisions of this act insofar as the same may be applicable. 
                  Section 20. - Same—Venue and jurisdiction. 
                  Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this act or any suit or action against such authority shall be brought in the Superior Court of Union County, Georgia, and any action pertaining to validation of any bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall likewise be brought in said court which shall have exclusive, original jurisdiction of such actions. 
                  Section 21. - Same—Validation. 
                  Bonds of the authority shall be confirmed and validated in accordance with the procedures of the Revenue Bond Law, as amended. The petition for validation shall also make party defendant to such action any municipality, county, authority, subdivision or instrumentality of the State of Georgia which has contracted with the authority for services and facilities of the water system for which bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated, and such municipality, county, authority, subdivision or instrumentality shall be required to show cause, if any, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the court and the validity of the terms thereof be determined and the contract or contracts adjudicated as security for the payment of any such bonds of the authority. The bonds, when validated, and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds, against the authority issuing the same, and any municipality, county, authority, subdivision or instrumentality contacting with the said Bald Mountain Water and Sewer Authority. 
                  Section 22. - Same—Interest of bondholders protected. 
                  While any of the bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties of existence of said authority, or of its officers, employees or agents, shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of such bonds, and no other entity, department, agency or authority will be created which will compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the rights and interests of the holders of such bonds, nor will the state itself so compete with the authority. The provisions of this act shall be for the benefit of the authority and the holders of any such bonds, and upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions hereof, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds. 
                  Section 23. - Moneys received considered trust funds. 
                  All moneys received pursuant to the authority of this act, whether all proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds, as grants, or other contributions, or as revenues, fees and earnings, shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided in this act. 
                  Section 24. - Purpose of the authority. 
                  [(a)]	Without limiting the generality of any provisions of this act, the general purpose of the authority is declared to be that of acquiring an adequate source or sources of water supply, treatment of such water, and thereafter, the distribution of same to the various townships and citizens in Union County and environs, including adjoining counties and municipalities located therein, and further for the general purpose of gathering and treatment of waste, both individual and industrial, but such general purpose shall not restrict the authority from selling and delivering water direct to consumers in these areas where there does not exist water distribution systems or furnishing sewer facilities to such consumers, and areas where neither any county nor municipality deems it desirable or feasible to furnish water in such locality. 
                  [(b)]	The authority shall also have authority, where it deems it feasible, to sell its products and services to consumers, governmental agencies or governmental instrumentalities of adjoining states, provided the laws of the adjoining states do not prohibit or tax said activity. 
                  [(c)]	The authority shall not have the authority to construct water lines for the distribution of water directly to consumers within any water district or municipality without first obtaining the express written consent of the appropriate governing bodies of the above-referred to water districts or municipalities. 
                  Section 25. - Rates, charges and revenues; use. 
                  The authority is authorized to prescribe, fix and collect rates, fees, tolls or charges, and to revise from time to time and collect such rates, fees, tolls or charges for the services, facilities or commodities furnished, and in anticipation of the collection of the revenues of such undertakings or project, to issue revenue bonds as herein provided to finance, in whole or in part, the cost of the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, improvement, betterment or extension of the water and sewer utility system, and to pledge to the punctual payment of said bonds and interest thereon all or any part of the revenues of such undertaking or project, including the revenues of improvements, betterments or extensions thereto thereafter made. 
                  Section 26. - Rules and regulations for operation of projects. 
                  It shall be the duty of the authority to prescribe rules and regulations for the operation of the project or projects constructed under the provisions of this act, including the basis on which water and sewer service and facilities shall be furnished. 
                  Section 27. - Powers declared supplemental and additional. 
                  The foregoing sections of this act shall be deemed to provide an additional and alternative method for the doing of the things authorized thereby and shall be regarded as supplemental and additional to powers conferred by other laws and shall not be regarded as in derogation of any powers now existing. 
                  Section 28. - Liberal construction of act. 
                  This act being for the welfare of various political subdivisions of the state and its inhabitants shall be liberally construed to effect the purposes thereof. 
                  Section 29. - Severability. 
                  In the event any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this act shall be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional, such adjudication shall in no manner affect the other sections, subsections, sentences, clauses or phrases of this act, which shall remain of full force and effect as if the section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase so declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional were not originally a part hereof. The General Assembly declares that it would have passed the remaining parts of this act if it had known that such part or parts hereof would be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional. 
                  Section 30. - Effect on other governments. 
                  This act does not in any way take from Union County or any municipality located therein or any adjoining county the authority to own, operate and maintain water or sewer systems or issue revenue certificates as is provided by the Revenue Bond Law of Georgia.

                  Sec. 10-31. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this chapter is to regulate certain types of businesses, including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot defacto approach prohibition. Otherwise a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult entertainment establishments, this chapter represents a balancing of competing interests; reduced criminal activity and protection of neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.

The alcohol board must verify that the successor in interest meets the qualifications for licensure and that no ordinance violations exist. Such temporary license shall be valid for 60 days or until the application for a permanent license is granted or denied by the alcohol board. A temporary license may be issued if the denial of such would create an undue hardship or cause an existing business to close. The fee for a temporary license shall be set by the governing authority and is in addition to the regular application fee.

No license shall be issued or renewed until such debts are paid in full. 
                  (w)	Upon completion of the investigation, the alcohol board shall submit its recommendation to the governing authority who may act on the recommendation of the alcohol board if the governing authority finds that the alcohol board has determined:

                  (2)	Upon the sale of any wine there is imposed an excise tax of $0.22 per liter and a proportionate tax at the same rate on all fractional parts of a liter.

                  (e)	Wholesalers collecting excise taxes shall be allowed a percentage of the tax due and accounted for and shall be reimbursed in the form of a deduction in submitting, reporting and paying the amount due, if the amount is not delinquent at the time of payment. The rate of the deduction shall be the same rate authorized for deductions from state tax under O.C.G.A. § 48-8-50. 
                  (f)	Determination of deficiencies.
                  (1)	If the county has cause to believe that the return or returns of the tax or the amount of the tax required to be paid to the county by any person is not proper, it may compute and determine the amount required to be paid upon the basis of any information that is within or may come into its possession. One or more deficiency determinations may be made of the amount due for one or more monthly period(s). 
                  (2)	The amount of the determination shall bear interest at the rate of 0.75 percent per month, or fraction thereof, from the due date of taxes. 
                  (3)	The county shall give to the licensee or wholesaler written notice of its determination regarding a deficiency. The notice may be served personally or by mail, if by mail, such service shall be addressed to the licensee at his address as it appears in the records of the county. Service by mail is complete when mailed with a certificate of service stamped thereon and a copy retained in county files or when delivered by certified mail with a receipt signed by the addressee. 
                  (4)	Except in the case of failure to make a return, every notice of a deficiency determination shall be mailed within 30 days after the tenth day of the month following the calendar month for which the amount is proposed to be determined, or within 30 days after the return is filed, whichever period should last expire. 
                  (g)	Determination if no return made.
                  (1)	If any licensee or wholesaler fails to make a return, the county shall make an estimate of the amount of the gross receipts of the licensee, or as the case may be, of the amount of the total sales in this county which are subject to the tax. The estimate shall be made for the period or periods in respect to which the licensee failed to make the return and shall be based upon any information which is in possession of or may come into the possession of the county official. Written notice shall be given in the manner prescribed above. 
                  (2)	The amount of the determination shall bear interest at the rate of 0.75 percent per month, or fraction thereof, from the 20th day of the month following the calendar month for which the amount or any portion thereof would have been returned, until the date of payment. 
                  (h)	Any licensee or wholesaler which fails to pay the tax herein imposed or fails to pay any amount of the tax required to be collected and paid to the county within the time required shall pay a penalty of 25 percent of the tax owed in addition to interest as set forth above. 
                  (i)	The tax levied by this section may be enforced by execution in the same manner as other taxes of the county, and in addition, any failure of payment of such tax shall be grounds for revocation or refusal of the license of the delinquent taxpayer. The governing authority shall administer and enforce the provisions of this section for the collection of the tax herein imposed, and in so doing shall have the power to: 
                  (1)	Examine, or authorize the examination of, books, papers, records, financial reports, equipment, and other facilities of any person subject to the tax, in order to verify the accuracy of any report made, or if no report is made by the operator, to ascertain and determine the amount required to be paid; 
                  (2)	Require the filing of reports by any person or persons having possession or custody of information relating to the tax herein levied; and 
                  (3)	Allow a credit on any amount due and payable from persons who paid the tax herein levied but who were erroneously or illegally subjected thereto.

The use of electronic fences, tethers, runs and chains are not acceptable to confine an animal inasmuch as such methods allow access by other animals. Any time an unsterilized animal is not confined, the animal must be on a secure and sturdy leash while being walked by a responsible person. Any unsterilized animal that is unconfined or not on a leash shall be subject to citation, confiscation and impoundment, and, in addition to being subject to citation, the owner shall be required to have the animal sterilized within 30 days. The burden shall be on the owner of a sterilized animal to have proof available that the animal is sterilized. 
                  (i)	Unsterilized working animals (including show dogs) are exempt from the above confinement requirements while working, but their owners are required to keep such animals under control. The burden shall be on the owners to prove the animal was working at the time of the citation. Owners who negligently allow working animals to roam and run free at any time shall be subject to citation and sterilization under this section and under any other applicable section of this chapter.

                  Sec. 14-6. - Rabies vaccination and identification. 
                  (a)	Any dog, cat or ferret, which is more than three months of age, within the jurisdiction of the commissioner must have a valid and current rabies vaccination which shall have been administered by a licensed veterinarian. The burden shall be on the owner to provide verifiable proof of vaccination to animal control. Animals being kept in a shelter shall be exempt from the requirement of a rabies vaccination for up to 30 days. The requirements of this subsection include the need for up-to-date revaccinations. An animal owner found in violation of this subsection shall be required to comply with this subsection within seven days, or the animal control officer is hereby authorized to impound the animal and have the animal vaccinated.

                  (b)	An owner of an animal which bites or scratches a human being with force sufficient to break the integrity of the skin shall be subject to impoundment, and shall be subject to citation if found either in violation of the requirement to have a current rabies vaccination, or in violation of quarantine requirements, and may be further subject to additional requirements and penalties pursuant to other provisions of this chapter as well as all Georgia state quarantine requirements. 
                  (c)	It is unlawful for anyone (other than a licensed veterinarian or animal control) to kill or release any animal under observation for rabies or suspected of having been exposed to rabies or any animal which has bitten a human being, or to remove such animal from the county without written permission from animal control and the director of public health. 
                  (d)	All owners of animals vaccinated against rabies shall obtain and keep available for each animal owned a valid certificate of vaccination, along with a rabies tag indicating the year it was issued. For all dogs, the tag shall be securely fastened to the collar of the dog for which it was issued. It is assumed that any animal has not had a rabies vaccination if proof cannot be provided for the administration of such vaccination. 
                  (e)	All dog owners are required to affix identification to their animals, either on the dog's collar or by other means such as microchip, and such identification shall be sufficient to trace or locate the dog's owner. 
                  (f)	Any dog, cat or ferret that has been in an animal shelter is required to obtain a current rabies vaccination and be sterilized upon being released to its owner or released for adoption. If the dog, cat or ferret is less than three months of age, the animal shelter shall require the owner to fulfill the requirement of a rabies vaccination when the dog, cat or ferret attains the age of three months and present proof of such vaccination and sterilization to the shelter that released the dog, cat or ferret. Animal control or the shelter that released the animal is authorized to pick up the animal and have it vaccinated and/or sterilized, the additional cost of which shall be reimbursed by the owner. The owner shall be subject to a citation for failure to comply with an adoption agreement.

                  (a)	It shall be unlawful for any person to abandon or abuse, injure, neglect, torture, torment, maim, mutilate, beat, wound, poison or kill an animal, or to confine or tether an animal in an unsafe or non-humane manner, or to confine an animal without sufficient ventilation and protection from extreme temperatures. The allowance of any condition, or failure to provide any care, which shall endanger an animal's health shall constitute abuse. This shall also include having a number of animals that exceeds an owner's ability to provide proper care and shelter in the opinion of animal control or a licensed veterinarian, and failure to provide adequate food and water, failure to obtain needed veterinary care to relieve pain and suffering, failure to appropriately treat an animal for parasitic infestations, and failure to provide humane care. 
                  (b)	It shall be unlawful for anyone to abandon any dog or other domesticated animal, owned by or in the possession, including temporary possession, of any person. Such abandonment shall include leaving or putting out any animal, whether the animal is healthy, sick, injured, or diseased, on any private or public property, or aiding or permitting such leaving or putting out. It shall be unlawful for anyone to abandon any dead animal on any private or public property, or to fail to bury or otherwise properly dispose of the carcass within 24 hours after an animal's death in accordance with applicable state and county health regulations. 
                  (c)	An animal owner is required to provide proper housing for a domesticated animal (depending on the breed), which shall at a minimum for dogs and most domesticated animals consist of three sides, a roof, and a floor, constructed in such a way as to keep an animal protected from the elements and extreme temperatures, and be of such a size that the animal can enter, exit, stand, turn around, and sleep comfortably. An owner is required to provide adequate and sanitary food and water. 
                  (d)	It is the policy of animal control that tethering or chaining a dog as a permanent means of confinement is an unsafe, unwise, and dangerous practice. In the event an owner uses a tether or chain to confine a dog, it shall be of sufficient construction as to not constitute abuse or a danger to the dog and shall allow the dog sufficient freedom to safely perform its necessary activities and functions in the judgment of animal control. Improper, inhumane, and unsafe tethering and chaining as a permanent means of confinement shall be considered animal cruelty. 
                  (e)	It shall be unlawful and shall constitute animal cruelty to buy, trade, own, possess, keep, sell or train any animal with the intent that such animal shall be engaged in an exhibition of fighting; or to build, make, maintain or keep a pit, or allow a pit to be built, for the purpose of an exhibition of animal fighting; or, in any manner, to encourage, instigate, promote or assist in an exhibition of animal fighting; or charge admission, be an assistant, umpire or participant or be present as a spectator to any exhibition of animal fighting. 
                  (f)	Upon a finding of extreme circumstances, animal control may immediately impound any abandoned, mistreated or abused animals as described in this section and shall deal with the animal in accordance with animal control regulations and the provisions of this chapter and state law. 
                  (g)	A person who commits any offense of abandonment, cruelty, mistreatment or abuse as delineated in the above provisions shall be subject to a citation in addition to the criminal penalties imposed by O.C.G.A. § 16-12-4.

                  (a)	A law enforcement officer or dog control officer shall immediately impound a dog if the officer believes the dog poses a threat to the public safety. A law enforcement officer or dog control officer shall be authorized, but not required, to impound animals that are at large or are determined by animal control to be the subject of a violation of this chapter. In the case of livestock and wild animals, whether dead or alive, animal control is also authorized to move the animals off of roads and highways and public and private property, where they may have escaped or wandered from an owner's property. Outside contractors may be used as needed, and an owner shall be liable for any such costs incurred by animal control. The animal control officer may, in addition to or in lieu of impoundment or moving an animal, issue a citation for violation of any applicable section of this chapter. 
                  (b)	Subject to any limitations imposed by state law, an animal control officer or any law enforcement officer shall have the authority to rescue any animal that appears to be suffering from a serious medical emergency. The rescued animal may be provided with immediate veterinary care if the officer deems such care necessary to prevent physical pain, suffering, disability or death to the animal, or in extreme circumstances may authorize euthanasia of the animal. The animal's owner, if known, shall be responsible for all expenses incurred for the rescue, moving, euthanasia, burial or subsequent treatment of the animal. 
                  (c)	Any animal impounded which is found to be diseased or injured and whose ownership is unknown or is relinquished in writing, or whose owner cannot be immediately contacted, may immediately be destroyed if in the opinion of a licensed veterinarian or the chief animal control officer the severity of the injury or disease indicates that euthanasia is a humane course of action. 
                  (d)	Any impounded animal that has no identification or rabies tag shall be held for a period of at least 72 hours. If the owner does not come forward and cannot be located, then after the period of impoundment, the animal shall become the property of the county. The county shall then be authorized to make whatever arrangements it deems appropriate for the animal or dispose of the animal in accordance with animal control policy. 
                  (e)	Any impounded animal whose owner can be determined shall be held for a period of at least five days, during which the animal control officer shall attempt to locate and notify the animal's owner. If the owner does not come forward and cannot be located, then after the period of impoundment, the animal shall become the property of the county. An owner who has been located and notified shall pick up his animal and arrange to pay all fees including veterinary, moving, burial, or impoundment fees of any kind, within 36 hours of notification, or the animal will be considered abandoned, and the owner may be subject to citation for abandonment. 
                  (f)	Any owner claiming an animal that has been impounded shall be charged a one-time impound fee plus a daily boarding fee, including any part of a day, for the period of impoundment, plus a rabies inoculation fee and any other fees, including those charged by outside contractors, if applicable, and reimbursement for any, vet, medical expenses, and any other costs which shall be the sole responsibility of the owner prior to the animal being released. In the event an animal is required to be quarantined during impoundment, an additional daily fee will be charged. An owner shall receive a one-time credit if proof is furnished of a current rabies vaccination, and a further credit if proof is furnished that the animal has been sterilized prior to impoundment. 
                  (g)	A schedule of current impoundment and Union County boarding fees and credits in effect shall be available at the at the animal control office. Fees for outside contractors and boarding at other shelters and at veterinary facilities shall be the fees actually charged. The fees and any credits, which shall be payable directly to an outside contractor or to the county, may be changed at any time and from time to time as determined by the facility or the commissioner, and are not limited to the fees described herein. The fees payable to and collected by the county are not penalties, but are imposed for the sole purpose of defraying expenses borne by the county for animal control. 
                  (h)	An animal surrendered to animal control for any reason may be immediately placed for adoption or humanely destroyed in the discretion of animal control so long as the owner has affirmatively represented in writing that he or she is the legal owner of the animal and the owner agrees to hold the county and its officials and employees harmless from any liability, claims, or damages that may be sustained by reason of the adoption or destruction of the animal. 
                  (i)	Absent extreme circumstances, in no event shall any animal be redeemed by its lawful owner, possessor, or custodian unless all fees owed are paid, and unless the owner is in compliance with this chapter and all animal control rules and regulations. 
                  (j)	A working dog that is found at large shall be considered under the control of its owner/handler when, upon investigation, it is found to have been engaged in a hunt, a hunting trial or training, or working, or is under voice command; and which has either a tracking collar and/or positive traceable identification. Upon proof of a rabies vaccination, the owner/handler shall not be issued a citation, nor incur an impoundment fee, but shall be required to pay all boarding fees and necessary medical costs as set forth in this section.

                  (a)	Identification and classification. Upon receiving a report of a dog believed to be subject to classification as a dangerous dog or vicious dog within a dog control officer's jurisdiction, the dog control officer shall make such investigations as necessary to determine whether such dog is subject to classification as a dangerous dog or vicious dog. 
                  (b)	Notice to owner. When a dog control officer determines that a dog is subject to classification as a dangerous dog or vicious dog, the dog control officer shall either mail (certified mail) or deliver by personal sheriff's service a dated notice to the dog's owner within 72 hours.

                  Sec. 18-133. - Administration. 
                  (a)	Upon the implementation of this article, all properties or parcels of land having access to a street or road within the county shall be identified in accordance with a uniform numbering system which shall be shown on maps filed in and kept by the Union County 911 Mapping Office.

                  (a)	Use. 
                  (1)	The county shall use the frontage interval/grid addressing system to assign new street addresses and unit designators. The 911 mapping office shall assign present and future structure numbers on both sides of every street or road with even numbers being assigned to one side of a street and odd numbers on the other. 
                  (2)	In assigning numbers, the 911 mapping office shall have the authority to determine beginning and ending points, assignment of left and right sides, even and odd assignments, questions regarding cul-de-sacs, circles, street segments which are not contiguous, and make decisions in unusual and non-conforming situations. 
                  (3)	Each structure shall be assigned a separate number. A unit designator shall be assigned for each separate and distinct occupant of a structure including apartments, company, agency, etc. within a building. 
                  (4)	The combination of numbers and the road or street name shall be the official street address of each structure or building. The street address shall serve as the official mailing address for postal patrons receiving home mail delivery.

                  (1)	Whenever any building or structure shall be erected or located after the initial implementation of the uniform numbering system, it shall be the duty of the property owner to obtain the assigned street address for the structure and to post the number in accordance with this article. 
                  (2)	An application for a building permit for a new structure shall be considered an application for a street address assignment. The building permit official shall coordinate with the 911 mapping office for the assignment of street addresses, and provide the assigned street address to the applicant not later than 30 days following issuance of the building permit. 
                  (3)	Final approval for a certificate of occupancy of any principal building erected or repaired, or uses requiring a street address, shall be withheld until a permanent and approved number has been displayed in accordance with the provisions of this article. The building inspector will make this item part of the final inspection.

                  (b)	The governing authority shall, at its sole option, either provide street number identifiers to each owner/occupier of every structure, free of charge one time only at the time of implementation of this article, or in the alternative, require structure and building owners to post numbers in the manner specified by the 911 mapping office and/or in accordance with the BOCA National Property Maintenance Code, Section PM-304.3, Exterior Structure, Street Numbers. 
                  (c)	In the event the governing authority opts to provide the initial numbers free of charge, the 911 mapping office will supply the numbers. In the event of loss or destruction, property owners are required to notify the 911 mapping office within seven days following the discovery of loss or destruction, whichever is later. The 911 mapping office shall provide a replacement sign, the cost of which may be charged to the property owner, at the discretion of the 911 mapping office depending on the cause of the loss or destruction. 
                  (d)	Numbers will be placed at the driveways for residential structures and immediately above or on the door for commercial structures or other location as required for safety by the 911 mapping office to be in the interests of safety and welfare. The 911 mapping office will provide information and instructions on the placement of numbers and unit designators. 
                  (e)	The owner, occupant, or agent of each structure or use requiring a structure number, upon posting or affixing the new number, shall remove any previous or different number in order to avoid mistake or confusion. 
                  (f)	The owner/occupant shall maintain the structure number and any unit designator at all times so that as viewed from the road or street, the number shall not be obstructed from view by landscaping, shrubs, vegetation, canopies, fences, lamp-posts, or any other plant or structure or by any other means.

                  (a)	The 911 mapping office shall assign street names for streets and roads as it deems appropriate and necessary in its judgment. Generally names will be assigned for a street that accesses two or more lots or properties on which there is a structure, regardless of whether the street or road ownership is public or private. Under no circumstances shall the assignment of a street or road name constitute or imply acceptance of the street or road as a county maintained street or road. 
                  (b)	The 911 mapping office shall have sole authority to approve street names for new development and construction within the county, whether public or private, subject to the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (c)	Proposed names for new streets and roads must be submitted by the owner or developer for approval by the 911 mapping office at the time of applying for a land clearing, septic, or building permit, whichever is first applied for.

                  (e)	The 911 mapping office shall refuse to assign or allow street and road names that duplicate, sound like, or are deceptively or confusingly similar to previously existing names, or are deemed inappropriate, or confusing for purposes of emergency response. The 911 mapping office shall have the authority to approve or disapprove of any name at its sole discretion. 
                  (f)	Previously existing duplicate, confusing, or unacceptable street names shall be changed as deemed necessary by the 911 mapping office. 
                  (g)	The 911 mapping office shall make every effort to retain street and road names with historical significance and those that have been in use for long periods of time whenever possible and practicable. 
                  (h)	At its discretion, the 911 mapping office will generally not assign street names that are longer than 12 letters including spaces. Previously existing names with more than 12 letters including spaces shall be retained as grandfathered if the names otherwise meet the criteria of this chapter. 
                  (i)	In the event there is a dispute about the name of an existing street or a question as to whether an existing street has been previously named, the 911 mapping office, at its discretion, shall assign a name to the street under the same procedure as that for naming a new street.

The petition must be signed by 100 percent of the property owners, (in the cases of trusts, estates, corporations or partnerships, by the president, all partners, the trustee, or executor) having access to the street or road whose name is proposed to be changed, and shall be filed with the 911 mapping office. The petition may not be filed until and unless the 911 mapping office has confirmed the availability and given written approval of the proposed name but not later than 90 days following confirmation and approval. If no petition is filed within the 90-day period, then the confirmation and approval shall expire. 
                  (b)	A drawing or plat indicating all structure or building locations on the street and identifying owners as they appear on the petition must accompany the petition at the time of filing. 
                  (c)	Payment of a deposit in the amount of $175.00 per street sign needed shall accompany the petition. Fifty percent of this deposit shall be refunded if the request for name change is denied for any reason by the 911 mapping office. The deposit, which shall be non-refundable if the request for name change is granted, represents the estimated cost for purchase and installation, as well as administrative costs associated with street signs. Any additional itemized costs not covered by the deposit shall be paid by the petitioners upon the completion of the installation of signs. 
                  (d)	The 911 mapping office shall review and make what ever investigation and verifications it deems appropriate, after which it shall inform the petitioners in writing within 60 days of the filing of the petition of the final approval or disapproval of the request.

                  Sec. 30-33. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)	General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) below. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)	Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)	Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) below shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (2) below or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in the subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)	A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection shall not apply to any land-disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)	Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)	The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)	The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in (c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)	Rules and regulations. The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the manual for erosion and sediment control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)	Stripping of vegetation, regarding and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)	Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
                  (3)	Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)	Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
                  (5)	The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)	Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
                  (7)	Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)	Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)	To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)	Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)	Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
                  (12)	Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)	Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)	Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) herein; 
                  (15)	Except as provided in subsection (16) below, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year-round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 or Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.	No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.	The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)	There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.	No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.	The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)	Adoption of additional rules and regulations. Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) herein. 
                  (e)	Presumption of violation. The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article of the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. O-2010-02, 5-20-2010)
                  Sec. 30-34. - Application and permit process. 
                  (a)	General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)	Application requirements. 
                  (1)	No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of Union County without first obtaining a permit from the commissioner to perform such activity. 
                  (2)	The application for a permit shall be submitted to the commissioner and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) below. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 30-33(b) and (c) will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)	A fee for subdivisions in the amount of $300.00 for 1-25 acres, and $10.00 per acre for each additional acre over 25, shall be charged. For commercial sites, the fee shall be based on the number of acres of disturbed land, and shall be in the amount of $500.00 for up to two acres, and $200.00 per acre for each additional acre over two. If the project is neither commercial nor a subdivision, but is not exempt under section 30-32, the fee shall be based on the number of acres of disturbed land, and shall be in the amount of $300.00 for up to two acres, and $10.00 for each additional acre over two. No local fees shall bee assessed for any single-family residence that is non-exempt under subsection 30-32(4). 
                  (4)	In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land-disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the Division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (5)	Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 30-33(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (7) below have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (6)	If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this subsection (b), or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (7)	The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this article or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)	Plan requirements. 
                  (1)	Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsection 30-33(b) and (c), or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The manual for erosion and sediment control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)	Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)	Permits. 
                  (1)	Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)	No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsections 30-33(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(7) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)	Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)	If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)	The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)	The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1).

                  Sec. 30-35. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)	The county will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)	The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)	The commissioner shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)	No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)	The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commissioner or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)	The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  (a)	Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  (b)	Stop-work orders. 
                  (1)	For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning. 
                  (2)	For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and 
                  (3)	All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  (4)	When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)	Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of subsection 30-34(b)(7). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)	Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any city charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article under county ordinances approved under this article shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

                  Sec. 30-73. - Forest service existing watershed protection efforts. 
                  In response to the issue of how soil resources can be managed to prevent erosion and the reduction of water quality, the United States Forest Service's (USFS) Land and Resource Management Plan for the Chattahoochee and Oconee National Forests indicates that total sediment yield will decrease by an average of five percent from present conditions (1980s) through road closings and cable logging, and that wetlands and floodplains will continue to receive special management consideration. The land and resource management plan sets forth specific forest-wide standards and guidelines which address riparian area management. These protection measures include the following: 
                  (1)	Erosion protection strips are applicable to define stream channels, wetlands, lakes and other bodies of water. The strip width is determined by land slope, as follows: 

                   
                  (2)	Shade protection strips are applicable along perennial streams and cold water lakes and other water bodies to prevent increases in water temperature due to solar radiation in waters capable of supporting cold water fisheries. The width varies on small perennial streams with no fisheries to 80 feet on large perennial streams with high fishery values. 
                  (3)	The plan supports the goal of meeting all federal, state and local water quality standards.
                  (4)	Temporary and sustained road grades of five percent or less are preferred with up to ten percent being permissible. Grades between ten and 20 percent can be for short distances of up to 300 feet. Grades exceeding ten percent (six percent on clays) will have a minimum gravel thickness of two inches for traction. Grades over 20 percent shall require the approval of the forest supervisor. (Roads typically produce 90 percent of the sediment to streams.) 
                  (5)	Wheel or crawler vehicles used to log timber will not normally be operated within 40 feet of a stream (on zero to 20 percent slopes) or 80 feet (in 21—45 percent slopes). 
                  (6)	Aerial pesticide application will be at least 100 feet from flowing streams or open water, logging debris that would damage fish habitat or channel stability will be kept out of defined stream channels, and portable sawmills shall be located at least 300 feet from streams and water bodies. 
                  (7)	In water supply areas, no decrease will occur in the acres of hardwood types below 1980 levels, and increases in hardwood acres will be encouraged.

                  Sec. 30-74. - Applicability. 
                  The regulations set forth in section 30-73 shall apply to all properties located within the Nottely River water supply watershed, as generally indicated on map 5-8 identified as exhibit A, which is on file in the office of the commissioner and is incorporated in this article by reference, and areas identified in section 30-77.

                  The following uses are prohibited within the Nottely River water supply watershed: 
                  (1)	Hazardous waste treatment and disposal facilities.
                  (2)	New sanitary landfills, unless provided with synthetic liners and leachate collection systems. 
                  (3)	Hazardous materials handling facilities, unless operations are performed on impermeable surfaces having spill and leak collection systems prescribed by the state department of natural resources.

                  Sec. 30-76. - Exemptions. 
                  The following uses shall be exempt from the stream corridor buffer and setback provisions of this article: 
                  (1)	Any land use within the Nottely River water supply watershed which was in existence prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived. Any undeveloped lot which is part of a subdivision plat recorded prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall also be exempted from this article and, provided, such activities shall not impair the quality of the drinking water stream as authorized by the state department of natural resources' rules for environmental planning criteria, chapter 391-3-16. 
                  (2)	Agricultural and forestry uses, provided such activities are consistent with best management practices established by the state forestry commission or the state department of agriculture and, provided, such activities shall not impair the quality of the drinking water stream as authorized by the state department of natural resources' rules for environmental planning criteria, chapter 391-3-16. 
                  (3)	Mining activities, if permitted by the state department of natural resources pursuant to the Georgia Surface Mining Act of 1968, as amended. 
                  (4)	Public or private water or sewer piping systems, water or sewer pumping stations, electric power lines, fuel pipelines, telephone lines, roads, driveways, bridges, river/lake access facilities, stormwater systems, railroads and other similar utilities and road crossings, if they cannot feasibly be located outside stream corridor buffer and setback areas, subject to the following conditions: 
                  a.	The utilities shall be located as far from the stream bank as reasonably possible.
                  b.	The installation and maintenance of the utilities shall be such to protect the integrity of the buffer and setback areas as best as reasonably possible. 
                  c.	The utilities shall not impair the quality of the drinking water stream as authorized by the state department of natural resources' rules for environmental planning criteria, chapter 391-3-16.

                  (a)	Perennial stream corridors within a seven-mile radius upstream of the Blairsville water supply intake on the Nottely River shall be protected by the following provisions: 
                  (1)	A natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained for a distance of 50 feet for residential and 100 feet for commercial on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream banks. 
                  (2)	No impervious surface shall be constructed within the 50 feet for residential and 100 feet for commercial setback area on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream banks. 
                  (3)	Septic tanks and septic tank drainfields are prohibited in the 50-foot impervious surface setback area. 
                  (b)	Perennial stream corridors outside a seven-mile radius upstream of the Blairsville water supply intake on the Nottely River shall be protected by the following provisions: 
                  (1)	A buffer shall be maintained for a distance of 50 feet for residential and 100 feet for commercial on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream banks. 
                  (2)	No impervious surface shall be constructed within the 50 feet for residential and 100 feet for commercial setback area on both sides of the stream as measured from the stream banks. 
                  (3)	Septic tanks and septic tank drainfields are prohibited in the 50-foot impervious surface setback areas.

                  Sec. 30-78. - Impervious surface limitations. 
                  Technical estimates by the Georgia Mountains RDS, based on detailed existing land use data by the Tennessee Valley Authority, indicate that impervious surface coverage within the Nottely River water supply watershed is only less than one percent of the entire land area within the watershed. This impervious surface area is therefore nowhere near the maximum of 25 percent recommended by the state department of natural resources, and therefor, no specific provisions to limit impervious surfaces in the watershed are needed. However, the county will monitor impervious surface coverage within the watershed at the time of each future update to the shortterm work program of the comprehensive plan, to determine if impervious surface area limitations may be necessary.

                  Sec. 30-111. - Findings. 
                  (a)	The 1991 Georgia Mountain and River Corridor Protection Act requires local governments with protected rivers to adopt protection plans as part of the comprehensive plan. 
                  (b)	The county contains the Nottely River, a portion of which is classified as a "protected river." 
                  (c)	Without adoption of a river corridor protection plan, the county would lose its status as a qualified local government and eligibility to receive certain state grants and loans. 
                  (d)	A river corridor protection plan has been prepared according to the minimum standards and procedures for protection of river corridors by the state department of natural resources, such standards are adopted as 391-3-16.04, "Criteria for River Corridor Protection," of the department's rules and regulations. 
                  (e)	A public hearing on the river corridor protection plan was held by the commissioner on July 29, 1997. 
                  (f)	The state department of community affairs, office of coordinated planning, has approved the river corridor protection plan as meeting the minimum standards and procedures.

                  The following uses are permitted, subject to certain conditions, within the 100-foot river corridor, without having to maintain a 100-foot natural vegetative buffer: 
                  (1)	Agricultural production and management, subject to the following conditions:
                  a.	Agricultural activity shall be consistent with best management practices established by the state soil and water conservation commission; 
                  b.	Agricultural activity shall not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the Federal Clean Water Act, as amended; and 
                  c.	Agricultural activity shall be consistent with all state and federal laws, and all regulations promulgated by the state department of agriculture. 
                  (2)	Timber production and harvesting, subject to the following conditions:
                  a.	Forestry activity shall be consistent with best management practices established by the state forestry commission; and 
                  b.	Forestry activity shall not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the Federal Clean Water Act, as amended. 
                  (3)	Single-family dwellings, including usual accessory structures and appurtenances, subject to the following conditions: 
                  a.	The dwelling shall be located on a tract of land containing at least two acres, excluding any property that lies within the banks of the river. This shall not, however, prohibit the construction of any dwellings on lots less than two acres which lawfully existed on record prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived. 
                  b.	There shall be only one such dwelling on each two-acre or larger tract of land.
                  c.	A septic tank serving such dwelling may be located within the buffer area.
                  d.	Septic tank drainfields shall not be located within the buffer area.
                  (4)	Any commercial, industrial, institutional, residential or other land uses existing within the river corridor prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived, provided that they shall: 
                  a.	Not impair the drinking quality of the river water; and
                  b.	Meet all applicable state and federal environmental rules and regulations.
                  (5)	Mining activities, if permitted by the state department of natural resources pursuant to the Georgia Surface Mining Act of 1968, as amended.

                  Except for land uses specifically exempted by section 30-114, all construction of buildings or structures is prohibited within the river corridor, and the existing natural vegetative buffer within 100 feet of the stream bank shall remain undisturbed.

                  Sec. 30-117. - Assessment of potential development. 
                  (a)	The portion of the Nottely River to which this article applies is a relatively short stretch, approximately 2.5 miles. The protected river corridor (100 feet on each side) contains about 2,640,000 square feet, or 60.6 acres of land. The first mile or so of this protected river corridor (the southern most section) is entirely contained within a 137-acre tract owned and managed by the United States Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). This means that more than one-fifth, approximately 23 percent, of the corridor is undisturbed land owned and managed by the TVA. 
                  (b)	In the remainder of the corridor, there are only seven tracts of land, the smallest being approximately 20 acres. Based on review of 1982 aerial photographs, all but one of such tracts appears to be largely cleared and utilized for agricultural land uses. Each of the seven parcels has some riparian vegetation left within the river corridor, although it appears to be less than 100 feet in many places. This article permits agricultural uses with only limited conditions. It is also evident from the dated aerial photographs that only one structure and one private driveway lies within the river corridor. There is only one public road crossing the river corridor and a portion of another public road existing within the river corridor. 
                  (c)	For these reasons, it is apparent that existing development is not adversely impacting water quality in the river corridor. Future land use, as recommended in this article, is predominantly agricultural. Since agriculture is permitted in the river corridor with only limited conditions, implementation of this article would not be unduly restrictive on private property rights. In fact, it appears that only one private property could potentially implement the entire buffer, and that too could be encroached upon for agriculture or other exempted uses. 
                  (d)	Land development, if consistent with this article, is not expected to adversely affect:
                  (1)	Unique/significant flora and fauna (none identified in the corridor);
                  (2)	The uses, activities and quality of Nottely River water;
                  (3)	Fishing or recreational uses (this segment is not a trout stream);
                  (4)	Historical and archeological sites (none identified in the corridor); or
                  (5)	Adjacent sensitive natural areas (none identified except floodplains).
                  Since floodplains are protected by chapter 34 of this Code, no adverse effects on floodplains are anticipated either.

                  Sec. 30-151. - Purpose. 
                  The mountains of the state are characterized by steep slopes, thin soils and, because of the natural stresses placed on such environments, they require special protection. Land-disturbing activity on the high elevation, steep slope mountains of the state potentially threatens the public health, safety, welfare and economic progress of the state. Such land-disturbing activity: 
                  (1)	May endanger the quality of surface water by increasing erosion and stream sedimentation;
                  (2)	Has the potential to induce landslides;
                  (3)	Has the potential to adversely affect groundwater due to difficulty in providing proper sewage disposal in areas of steep slope and high elevation; 
                  (4)	May damage the habitat for some species of wildlife, both plants and animal; and
                  (5)	May detract from the mountains' scenic and natural beauty which is vital to the local economy through the recreation and tourism industries. 
                  To protect against such adverse effects, this chapter is adopted.

The crests, summits and ridge tops of mountains whose flanks meet the criteria for a protected mountain shall also be included within the protected area, even though the slopes of such crests, summits and ridge tops have slopes of less than 25 percent. On an otherwise protected mountain, areas that are at an elevation of 2,200 feet or more, and have a slope of less than 25 percent, exclusive of valley floors, shall be included within the protected mountain area. For the purposes of this article, the term "valley floor" means a depression of the earth's surface where the slopes of mountains meet at a lower limit to become nearly level, and includes such associated areas at the base or toe of a mountain with a 10:1 (ten percent) slope or less. Illustration 1, attached to this article, provides a graphic of protected mountains in accordance with this definition. Illustration 2, attached to this article, indicates the angles of various slopes as a basis of comparison.

                  The most significant areas of unique flora and fauna are located on lands owned and managed by the United States Forest Service. Rare and endangered species may be located within areas of protected mountains, although specific sites are not known. Land development and the commencement of other activities, if they are consistent with the mountain protection plan, should not have a negative impact on wildlife and plant and animal habitats. However, all of the county's protected mountains may have areas worthy of conservation.

                  Sec. 30-168. - Groundwater and surface water quality. 
                  To a significant extent, groundwater and surface water are protected by existing state and federal regulations. Furthermore, much of the county's groundwater and surface water is protected through ownership and management by the U.S. Forest Service, through implementation of its land and resource management plan. Development and other activities consistent with the mountain protection plan will not have an adverse impact on protected mountains within the county.

                  Sec. 30-170. - Historical and archaeological resources. 
                  Historical and archaeological resources in the county are inventoried and assessed in the comprehensive plan. An analysis of the location of such resources indicates that historical and archaeological resources are predominantly located outside of protected mountain areas. The resources located within protected mountain areas are largely located on lands owned and managed by the U.S. Forest Service in accordance with its land and resource management plan. Therefore, development consistent with the mountain protection plan is not expected to have any adverse impact on existing historical and archaeological resources.

                  Sec. 30-211. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Function means the beneficial roles that wetlands serve, including storage, conveyance and attenuation of floodwater and stormwater; protection of water quality and reduction of erosion; habitat for wildlife, including rare, threatened and endangered species; food chain support for a wide variety of wildlife and fisheries; educational, historical and archeological value protection; and scenic, aesthetic and recreational amenities. 
                  Generalized wetland map means all wetlands within the jurisdiction of the county as indicated on the National Wetlands Inventory Map which is adopted in this definition as part of this article. 
                  Hydric soils mean soils that form as a result of saturated soil conditions. A list of such soils is maintained by the soil conservation service. 
                  Hydrophytic vegetation means macrophytic plants tolerant of or dependent on saturated soil conditions. 
                  Jurisdictional determination means an official, written statement or map signed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland means a wetland area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Amy Corps of Engineers. 
                  Regulated activity means any activity which will or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or drill material into waters of the United States, except those activities exempted in section 30-216 and Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 
                  Silviculture means the art of producing, reproducing and growing a forest of distinctive stands of trees. 
                  Temporary emergency permit means a temporary permit that may be issued in certain circumstances specified in this article. 
                  Wetland means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas (33 CFR 32.93). The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation. Freshwater wetlands do not include any areas defined as "coastal marshlands" by the Georgia Coastal Marshlands Protection Act. 
                  Wetland protection district means all wetlands within the jurisdiction of the county which are indicated on the generalized wetland map as "wetlands providing significant wildlife habitat and/or which may be subject to extensive mitigation." Such map should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands before engaging in a regulated activity. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the commissioner.

                  This article shall apply to all wetlands within the wetland protection district as defined in section 30-211 and located within the jurisdiction of the county. The generalized wetland map, adopted as part of this article, shows the general location of wetlands and the wetland protection district, and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands before engaging in a regulated activity. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter on such map and attached to such map, is adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the commissioner.

                  Sec. 30-214. - District boundaries. 
                  The generalized wetland map is a general reference document and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' guidance as to whether a Section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not necessarily represent the exact boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the county, and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal and state permitting requirements.

                  Sec. 30-215. - Local development permit required. 
                  No regulated activity will be permitted within the wetlands protection district without written permission or a permit from the commissioner or his designee. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetland protection district boundary, as determined by the commissioner or his designee, using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' determination shall be required. If the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a Section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued.

                  The following uses shall be allowed as a right within the wetland protection district to the extent that such uses are not prohibited by any other article or law and, provided, they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging, except as provided in this section: 
                  (1)	Operations conducted during normal silvicultural activities, including minor dredge and fill associated with road construction, harvesting and reforestation practices, provided, they meet the performance standards and road construction best management practices required under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
                  (2)	Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided, they do not affect waters of the state or the United States in such a way that would require an individual Section 404 permit. 
                  (3)	Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing. 
                  (4)	Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission. 
                  (5)	The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture. 
                  (6)	The pasturing of livestock, provided, riparian wetlands are protected, soil profiles are not disturbed and approved best management practices are followed. 
                  (7)	Education, scientific research and nature trails.

                  A temporary emergency permit can be issued in the wetland protection district by the commissioner or his designee for the following reasons: 
                  (1)	Maintenance or repair of lawfully located roads, structures and facilities used in the service of the public to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telegraph, telecommunication or other services, provided such roads, structures or facilities are not materially changed or enlarged and, prior to the commencement of work, written notice has been given to the commissioner or his designee and, provided, the work is conducted using best management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns, and chemical and biological characteristics of the wetland, are not impaired, and any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be minimized. 
                  (2)	Temporary water level stabilization measures associated with silvicultural operations, provided, they are necessary to alleviate abnormally wet or dry conditions that would have an adverse impact on the conduct of silvicultural activities if not corrected. 
                  (3)	Limited ditching, tilling, dredging, excavating or filling done solely for the purpose of maintaining or repairing existing drainage systems necessary for the cultivation of agricultural crops, provided, the maintenance or repair activity does not result in the impairment, alteration or loss of wetlands not previously subject to agricultural and silvicultural use under the terms and provisions of section 30-216 
                  (4)	Limited excavating and filling which is necessary for the repair and maintenance of piers, walkways, nature trails, observation decks, wildlife management shelters, boathouses or other similar water related structures, unobstructed flow of water and preserve the natural contour of the wetland.

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided, the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. (Note: accessory structures are not exempt from any requirement of this chapter.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not the alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home or a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

The market value of the building should be the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement or, in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not the alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include improvements to a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions, which have been preidentified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before such repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  Sec. 34-33. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)	The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)	These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damage, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.

                  Sec. 34-34. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)	Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities or erosion; 
                  (3)	Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)	Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)	Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  The objectives of this chapter shall include the following: 
                  (1)	Protect human life and health;
                  (2)	Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)	Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)	Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
                  (5)	Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

                  Sec. 34-74. - Variance procedures. 
                  (a)	The commissioner shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variances from the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (b)	The commissioner shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision or determination is made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
                  (c)	Any person aggrieved by the decision of the commissioner on a variance or appeal may appeal such decision to the county superior court. 
                  (d)	Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)	Variances may be issued for development which is necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided, the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)	Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)	In reviewing variance requests, the commissioner shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors and all standards specified in this section and other sections of this chapter. 
                  (h)	Conditions for a variance shall be as follows:
                  (1)	A variance shall be issued only when there is a:
                  a.	Finding of good and sufficient cause;
                  b.	Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.	Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)	The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore, any deviation from the standards set forth in this chapter must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor, and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)	The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)	Upon consideration of the factors listed in subsection (h) of this section and the purposes of this chapter, the commissioner may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as he deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

                  ARTICLE IV. - FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 34-101. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard within the county the following provisions shall be required: 
                  (1)	New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)	New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)	New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)	All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.	Designs for complying with the requirement of this subsection must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.	Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.	The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and
                  3.	Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices, provided, they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions. 
                  b.	So as not to violate the lowest floor requirements of this chapter, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for the parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises or entry to the elevated area. 
                  c.	The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)	All heating and air conditioning equipment and components, electrical, ventilation, plumbing and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within such components during conditions of flooding; 
                  (6)	Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces; 
                  (7)	New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
                  (8)	New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
                  (9)	On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
                  (10)	Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure which is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  Sec. 34-102. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard within the county the following provisions shall be required: 
                  (1)	New construction and substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data is available, new construction or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. If solid foundation perimeter walls are used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards set forth in section 34-101(4). 
                  (2)	Nonresidential construction. New construction, or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components shall have the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this subsection, and the engineer or architect shall provide such certification to the floodplain administrator. 
                  (3)	Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data is available: 
                  a.	All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on individual lots or parcels, in new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions or on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood must have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.	Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either the: 
                  1.	Lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.	Manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers, or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.	All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (See subsection 34-101(6)). 
                  d.	All recreational vehicles placed on sites must:
                  1.	Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  2.	Meet all the requirements for new construction set forth in this chapter, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections 34-102(3)a.—c. 
                  (4)	Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard as established in section 34-37 are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.	Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted, however, provided, it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification of such analyses. 
                  b.	If the requirement set forth in subsection (4)a. of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article.

                  Sec. 34-103. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways (A zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 34-37, where streams exist, but no base flood data has been provided (A zones), or where base flood data has been provided, but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (1)	When base flood elevation data or floodway data has not been provided in accordance with section 34-37, then the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source in order to administer the provisions of this article. If data is not available from such sources, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.	No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream, or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  b.	In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement, elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards set forth in subsection 34-101(4). Building sites which are filled and compacted, and which thereby create a building pad which is three feet above the highest adjacent grade, and which have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement, elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade are acceptable under the terms of this subsection. The floodplain administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (Ord. No. O-2000-002, art. 4, § C, 2-22-2000; Amd. of 7-21-2005)
                  Sec. 34-104. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). 
                  Areas of special flood hazard as established in section 34-37 may include designated AO shallow flooding areas. Such areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply to such areas: 
                  (1)	All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards set forth in subsection 34-101(4). The floodplain administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (2)	New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this subsection and shall provide such certification to the floodplain administrator. 
                  (3)	Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.

                  The mere existence of a nonconforming junkyard shall not constitute a valid reason to grant a variance for the additional establishment, re-building, expansion, or modification, of a junkyard. Upon written request, a variance from some or all of the requirements of this chapter may be granted at the discretion of the board of adjustments and appeals, if the board finds all of the following conditions exist: 
                  (1)	There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the property in question resulting from the location, size, shape, or topography which are not applicable to other lands in the area. 
                  (2)	A literal interpretation of the provisions of this article would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other similar junkyard owners. 
                  (3)	Granting the variance will not confer upon the property or the applicant any significant privileges which are denied to other properties or junkyard owners. 
                  (4)	The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this article and will not be injurious to the community or to the public health or general welfare. 
                  (5)	The special circumstances are not the result of or aggravated by actions, failures, or omissions of the applicant, or such circumstances do not arise when there are pre-existing violations of any codes or laws by the applicant. 
                  (6)	The variance would be a minimum variance which will make possible the logical use of the land. 
                  (7)	If the requested variance is granted, the junkyard will in all other aspects be in full compliance with this article.

                  (1)	A 50-foot buffer shall be required along the entire perimeter of the park. Except for the entrance road, the undisturbed buffer shall be planted with evergreen trees, vegetation, and shrubs, sufficient to screen the park from and to mitigate the negative effects of the park on the surrounding properties. 
                  (2)	In those instances where a pre-existing single-family or farm dwelling is adjacent to the park development and the dwelling is within 100 feet of the property line, the required buffer shall be 100 feet along all adjacent property lines within 100 feet of the dwelling. 
                  (3)	Where the site of a proposed park already has a natural buffer, and a developer utilizes and preserves that existing buffer, then the width of the required buffer may be reduced in whole or in part, so long as it is at least 25 feet in width and is of sufficient width and density to provide the required screening. 
                  (c)	General. 
                  (1)	Buffer areas shall contain no driveways (except the main entrance to the park); parking areas, patios, storm-water detention facilities, or any other structures or accessory uses except for a fence, wall, or earthen berm constructed to provide visual screening required to meet the standards of this article. Underground utilities may be permitted to cross a buffer if the screening standards of this article will be subsequently achieved. 
                  (2)	Perimeter buffers shall not include any portion of an existing or proposed public or private street, road, or right-of-way. 
                  (3)	All buffer areas shall be maintained as permitted in their mature planted condition, or restored to that condition if necessary. 
                  (d)	Minimum required screening. Minimum required screening shall consist of a natural buffer utilizing existing vegetation, supplemental vegetation or a structural buffer, whichever provides an opaque visual screen to a height of six feet, or any combination of existing, supplemental or replanted vegetation which can reasonably be expected to create an opaque visual screen six feet high within three growing seasons. 
                  (1)	Subject to approval, composition of the buffer may include a wall, fence, landscaped earthen berm, planted vegetation, existing vegetation, or any appropriate combination of these elements, and should provide a visual screen around the park sufficient to prevent most visual contact from the perimeter of the property and create the impression of total separation. 
                  (2)	The landscape plan shall prohibit clear cutting, and provide for minimal land disturbing, along with protection of the natural terrain. 
                  (3)	Utilization of existing vegetation is always preferred.
                  (4)	Within the buffer, existing or planted deciduous or evergreen trees shall be spaced no more than 30 feet apart, and evergreen shrubs shall be planted with a spacing of between five to eight feet on center. Shrubs and trees shall be native species or those locally adapted to the area. The natural buffer shall provide an opaque visual screen during all growing seasons of the year. 
                  (5)	New plantings comprising the buffer may be spread across the entire span of the buffer rather than planted in a row, so long as the screening objective is met. Every effort must be made to ensure sufficient maturity within three years to meet the screening requirements. 
                  (6)	Fences and freestanding walls shall present a finished and decorative appearance to the abutting property.

                  Sec. 44-136. - Homeowners association. 
                  (a)	Proposed restrictive covenants and by-laws for a homeowners association shall be submitted for approval by the governing authority as a required part of each application for a permit to develop a park where individual lots are intended to be sold rather than retained by the developer or park owner.

                  (h)	Each deed or other conveyance for any land within a park shall be recorded in the public records of Union County and shall be subject to recorded restrictive covenants that shall be binding on each owner and occupant, and further contain a notice that all privately maintained interior streets, roads, drives and utilities, buildings, water system, septic systems, and any other systems or items used by the residents shall be constructed and maintained solely by the owners and/or residents, without cost to the county.

                  (5)	In the event correction of the violation is ordered, and the violation is not corrected within 30 days, the county is authorized to remove, repair, remedy, or correct the violation. The owner shall then be liable for repayment to the county for the complete cost of removal, repair, and restoration of site. Until repayment is made, a lien against the real property shall be recorded in the public records of Union County.

                  The mere existence of a pre-existing non-conforming use or structure shall not constitute a valid reason to grant a variance. Upon written request sent by certified mail to the governing authority, a variance may but is not required to be granted at the discretion of the governing authority if the governing authority determines that all of the following conditions exist:

                  (3)	A literal interpretation of the provisions of this article would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other similar park owners under this article. 
                  (4)	Granting the variance will not confer upon the property or the applicant any significant privileges which are denied to other properties. 
                  (5)	The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this article and will not be injurious to the community or to the general welfare. 
                  (6)	The special circumstances are not the result of actions of the applicant.
                  (7)	The variance would be a minimum variance which will make possible the logical use of the land or structure. 
                  (8)	If the requested variance is granted, the park will in all other aspects be in full compliance with this article.

                  Cross reference— Definitions generally, § 1-2 
                  Sec. 62-33. - Regulations for billboards. 
                  (a)	All billboards must be located in such a way as to protect the scenic views of the county. Billboards should be placed on the side of knolls, mountains and ridges so as not to obstruct open and long-distance scenic views. 
                  (b)	No billboards shall be located within 1,000 feet of a church, public park, public playground, public recreation area, public forest, or cemetery. 
                  (c)	No individual billboard shall exceed an area of 288 square feet per face. Only one sign face shall be allowed to face the same direction per location. This allows back-to-back and V formation billboards but prohibits two sign faces side-by-side or over and under each other facing the same direction. This does not prohibit multiple face billboards that only project one face at a time in one direction as further regulated in this article. 
                  (d)	Only freestanding billboards shall be allowed. No off-premises signs may be fastened to trees or utility poles. 
                  (e)	No billboards shall be permitted within one mile of any other billboard on either side of the roadway. 
                  (f)	Billboards shall not exceed 30 feet in height. Billboard height shall be measured from the elevation of the road surface of the nearest roadway to the highest point on the billboard. Measurements shall be taken from the nearest edge of the traveled way, perpendicular from the location of the proposed billboard. 
                  (g)	The setback shall be 25 feet from the edge of any traveled way of any road.
                  (h)	Billboards shall be required to have the required DOT permit and must conform to all applicable regulations of O.C.G.A. § 32-6-1 et seq., which provides for the maintenance and use of public roads and control of outdoor advertising, and any other state or federal laws which may apply. Billboard owners and applicants for billboard permits shall be held to having knowledge of all state and federal regulations, and in no event shall the governing authority or any agent or employee of the governing authority be liable in any way for issuing a permit which is later found to violate state or federal regulations. 
                  (i)	No trees shall be cut along any right-of-way on any county road before or after locating, placing or erecting a billboard, except where a legal permit has been obtained from the Georgia Department of Transportation. 
                  (j)	No billboard shall be erected or maintained in such a manner as to be a hazard or a nuisance. Billboards may not be erected which would obstruct the view of motorists entering or exiting roads or highways or interfering with a driver's view of traffic. 
                  (k)	Illumination shall be limited to one light per face. No illuminated billboard shall give off light which glares, blinds, or has any such adverse effect on traffic. The light from illuminated billboards shall be established in such a way that adjacent residences and roadways are not adversely affected and that no direct light is cast upon adjacent residences and roadways. 
                  (l)	If illuminated, billboards which contain, include, or are illuminated by any flashing, intermittent, or moving light or lights except those giving public service information such as time, date, temperature, weather, or other similar information are prohibited. The illumination of mechanical multiple message signs may not be illuminated by flashing, intermittent, or moving light or lights, at any time, while rotating or in a fixed position. 
                  (m)	Each billboard owner shall make available without cost for county or community public messages any unsold faces which have remained blank for more than six months. 
                  (n)	Billboards which display untrue or false statements, or advertise or encourage any material or activity which is illegal, or which depicts any material which is obscene as such term is defined in O.C.G.A. ch. 16-12, or defined by federal law are prohibited. In accordance with Georgia law, outdoor advertising containing depictions of nudity or sexual conduct which are visible from the roadways of public roads may be startling or provocative and thereby divert the attention of motor vehicle drivers, thus causing real and substantial hazards to traffic safety. Union County declares that the purpose of this section is to protect the public welfare and safety against such hazards, and therefore no person or entity shall display any outdoor advertising containing any depiction of nudity or sexual conduct, as defined in O.C.G.A. § 32-6-52, when such depiction is visible from the roadway of any public road in the state highway system as defined in O.C.G.A. § 32-4-1. 
                  (o)	Animated billboards or billboards with any moving, swinging, or sound-producing elements are prohibited, except that billboards with rotating faces that only project one face at a time in one direction may be allowed. 
                  (p)	Multiple message signs shall be permitted on primary highways, and other highways under the following conditions: 
                  (1)	Each multiple message sign shall remain fixed for at least ten seconds;
                  (2)	When a message is changed mechanically, it shall be accomplished in three seconds or less; 
                  (3)	No such multiple message sign shall be placed within 5,000 feet of another mechanical multiple message sign on the same side of the highway; 
                  (4)	Any such sign shall contain a default design that will freeze the sign in one position if a malfunction occurs; 
                  (5)	Any maximum size limitations shall apply independently to each side of a multiple message sign; and 
                  (6)	Nonmechanical electronic multiple message signs that are otherwise in compliance with this subsection and are illuminated entirely by the use of light emitting diodes, back lighting, or any other light source shall be permitted under the following circumstances: 
                  a.	Each transitional change occurs within two seconds;
                  b.	If the department finds an electronic sign or any display or effect thereon to cause glare or to impair the vision of the driver of any motor vehicle or to otherwise interfere with the safe operation of a motor vehicle, then, upon the department's request, the owner of the sign shall promptly and within not more than 48 hours reduce the intensity of the sign to a level acceptable to the department; and 
                  c.	If a multiple message sign on a primary highway or other highway is in violation of any of the above conditions, its permit shall be revoked and the sign shall be removed. During the appeal of any violations of this section, the sign shall remain fixed until the matter is resolved.

                  (a)	It shall be unlawful for any person, company, entity, group or organization to erect, place, or substantially change any billboard on any road or highway, whether paved or unpaved, in the county without having first obtained a billboard permit. 
                  (b)	A billboard permit or a permit for modification to an existing billboard, once issued, shall expire and become null and void if the billboard construction or modification for which the permit was issued has not been completed within six months from the date of the permit. If a billboard is later desired to be erected at the same location, a new application must be processed and another fee paid. 
                  (c)	Upon proper application, a permit shall be issued or denied by the county within 60 days. 
                  (d)	Every billboard may be, but is not required to be, inspected by the governing authority or its designated agent, from time to time so as to determine continuing compliance with this article.

                  (b)	Each application shall be accompanied by plans, site plans, a survey, and any other information which the building department may require. Plans shall include the exact dimensions, area and proposed location of each billboard on the survey. 
                  (c)	Each application for erection or modifications of a billboard shall contain an agreement to indemnify and hold the county harmless of all damages, demands or expenses of any kind which may in any manner be caused by the billboard or structure.

                  (f)	All billboard owners must provide the governing authority with the name of an owner and/or a contact person, address and telephone number, and the name address and phone number of the billboard contractor. Changes in ownership and address must be reported within ten days of the change. Owners must provide proof of written consent from the landowner if the billboard is to be constructed on land not owned by the billboard owner. 
                  (g)	Every billboard constructed, erected or maintained shall be plainly marked at all times with the name of the person erecting or maintaining the billboard, and shall have the county permit number affixed to the billboard in such a manner that the information is legible from at least 50 feet away.

The registration shall be effective for one year from each May 15. Payment shall be made to the county. In the case of multiple message boards, each face shall be charged double the standard annual registration fee. In the case of electronic billboards, the fee is four times the standard fee per face. These fees are set to reflect the county time involved in monitoring and enforcing various types of billboards. 
                  (i)	Any billboard owner which has eight or more properly permitted billboards at the time this amended article is enacted may be permitted for two additional locations, and any billboard owner which has between four and seven properly permitted billboards at the time this amended article is enacted may be permitted for one additional location, in compliance with all provisions of this article with the sole exception of not needing to comply with the distance requirements of this article, provided that the new locations must be in a commercial area and may not have a negative impact on any residence; with the specific condition that any billboard company which chooses this option shall have 180 days to complete the billboard(s) and that these billboard owners further agree to not apply for any new billboards or the conversion of any billboards to mechanical or electronic billboards within five years of the enactment of this amended article.

In lieu of additional locations, the company may convert a regular existing billboard to a mechanical billboard. 
                  (k)	There is hereby authorized a billboard committee made up from three to five citizens of Union County along with the governing authority (or a representative of the governing authority) to review billboard applications and make recommendations as to placements, permits, variances, and to provide a forum for questions and possible disputes. 
                  (l)	If an applicant for a billboard permit has been denied a permit by any designated agent of the governing authority, the applicant may appeal the decision by filing a written request with the governing authority, which shall consider the appeal at the earliest appropriate meeting, but in no case more than 60 days after the date of the written request for an appeal.

                  Sec. 62-37. - Nonconforming billboards. 
                  (a)	Billboards which on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived were legally erected and maintained under all applicable state, federal and local laws and ordinances, and which become nonconforming under the provisions of this article, may continue in existence, unchanged in structure and size. 
                  (b)	A nonconforming billboard shall not be expanded, relocated or replaced by another billboard except in accordance with the provisions of this article. The substitution or interchange of panels or painted boards shall be allowed, however. 
                  (c)	Minor repairs and maintenance of nonconforming billboards, such as repainting or electrical repairs shall be allowed. However structural repairs or changes in the size or shape of the billboard shall not be permitted except to make the billboard comply with the provisions of this article, unless a variance is granted pursuant to section 62-40 
                  (d)	If a billboard is damaged or destroyed by wind, accident, fire or other disaster, the billboard may be rebuilt at the same location using new materials except the in-ground supports may be re-used if the building department determines they are sound and undamaged. Any rebuilding requires a permit. 
                  (e)	Each nonconforming billboard shall be registered annually as required by section 62-35 
                  (f)	If the owner of a nonconforming billboard applies for a permit to modify the billboard in order to bring the billboard into compliance with this article, the permit application fee is hereby waived, but all other requirements must be met. 
                  (g)	In the case of any nonconforming billboard which in its present location blocks or spoils any scenic view in the county, if the owner agrees to relocate the nonconforming billboard within 180 days of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived to an allowed location per section 62-33; the governing authority may grant a reasonable variance from the requirements of this article pertaining to square footage, setbacks, height, distance between billboards and number of faces only. If there are multiple sets of billboards requested to be moved under this provision, they shall be relocated separately in accordance with the provisions of this article.

To secure payment, the county may place a lien on the property for the cost of removal. 
                  (Ord. of 9-22-2011)
                  Sec. 62-39. - Abandoned or unregistered billboards. 
                  (a)	Any billboard which fails to become registered within 60 days after the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived or fails to be registered on or before January 1 of any year shall be found in violation of this article.

                  (b)	If the county is unable after due diligence to determine the ownership of a billboard which has remained unregistered for a period of more than one year, it shall be deemed to be an abandoned billboard. 
                  (c)	Any billboard that has remained blank or has not advertised a bona fide business or product or displayed a public service message for a period of two years shall be deemed to be an abandoned billboard. 
                  (d)	The county is authorized to remove any abandoned billboard. If an owner and an owner's address can be determined, advance notice by certified mail shall be given to the owner, providing the owner with 15 days' notice to bring the billboard into compliance with this article in addition to any other penalties imposed by this article.

                  Sec. 62-40. - Variances. 
                  The mere existence or destruction of a nonconforming billboard shall not constitute a valid reason to grant a variance for the building or rebuilding of a billboard. Upon written request, a variance from some or all of the requirements of this chapter may be granted at the discretion of the board of appeals and review, if the board finds all of the following conditions exist: 
                  (1)	There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the property in question resulting from the size, shape, or topography which are not applicable to other lands in the area, or when the extraordinary circumstances result from a declared natural disaster, an act of God, or war. 
                  (2)	A literal interpretation of the provisions of this article would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other similar billboard owners. 
                  (3)	Granting the variance will not confer upon the property or the applicant any significant privileges which are denied to other properties or billboard owners. 
                  (4)	The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this article and will not be injurious to the community or to the general welfare. 
                  (5)	The special circumstances are not the result of or aggravated by actions, failures, or omissions of the applicant, or such circumstances do not arise when there are pre-existing violations of any codes or laws by the applicant. 
                  (6)	The variance would be a minimum variance which will make possible the logical use of the land or structure. 
                  (7)	If the requested variance is granted, the billboard will in all other aspects be in full compliance with this article. 
                  (Ord. of 9-22-2011)

                  (a)	If any of the provisions of this article, or the application of this article to any person, organization, or circumstance, shall be held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the other provisions or application of such other provisions of this article. To this end the provisions of this article are hereby declared to be severable. 
                  (b)	All laws and ordinances, or parts thereof, which conflict with this article are repealed.
                  (c)	Nothing in this article shall be interpreted or applied so as to create any power or duty in conflict with the preemptive effect of any federal or state law. 
                  (d)	This article shall take effect and shall be enforced from and after the date of its adoption.

                  (c)	If a person is found guilty of a violation of the provisions of this article, the court and/or commissioner may cause written notice to be given, or incorporate into the court order to the violator instructing that person to properly address any provision still remaining in violation of this article for which such violator is convicted. Such notice shall be by personal service, but if the violator cannot be served with such notice, then such notice shall be sent by registered mail to the violator's last known address.

The purpose of such attachment is to preserve the health and safety of current and future landowners and users of such properties, to promote the integrity of the property description and values, and to record the location of such dump sites. The county's exercise of this subsection shall in no way be mandatory, and the county or its agents shall not be held liable for exercise of action or inaction for implementation of this subsection, nor for the costs of such action or inaction. (See Section 391-3-4-.06 of the Georgia Rules of Solid Waste Management.) 
                  (g)	The provisions of this section shall apply with full force and effect regardless of the provisions of any order of the court in which the violator was convicted.

If such abandoned antenna and/or tower is not removed within 60 days of receipt of notice from the county notifying the owners of such abandonment and requesting removal of the telecommunications facility, the county may remove such tower and/or antenna and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal. The county may pursue all legal remedies available to it to ensure that abandoned telecommunications facilities are removed. Delay by the county in taking action shall not in any way waive the county's right to take action. The county may seek to have the abandoned telecommunications facility removed regardless of the owner's or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna, and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted. 
                  (b)	If the owner of an abandoned tower or antenna wishes to use such abandoned tower or antenna, the owner first must apply for and receive all applicable permits and meet all of the conditions of this article as if such tower or antenna were a new tower or antenna. 
                  (Ord. No. O-2001-007, § 10, 9-20-2001)
                  Sec. 78-44. - Preexisting towers; nonconforming uses. 
                  (a)	All telecommunications facilities within the county which are operative on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall be allowed to continue their present use. Any tower which is nonconforming with respect to setback requirements set forth in this article may be replaced if such tower is destroyed, provided, the degree to which the structure is nonconforming does not increase and all other requirements of this article are met. Routine maintenance of existing telecommunications facilities shall be required. New construction, other than routine maintenance, shall comply with the requirements of this article. 
                  (b)	A telecommunications facility that has received the county's approval in the form of a building permit as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, but has not yet been constructed or placed in operation, shall be considered an existing telecommunications facility as long as such approval is current and not expired. 
                  (c)	Placement of an antenna or collocation on a nonconforming structure, provided, the degree to which the structure is nonconforming is not increased, shall not be considered an expansion of the nonconforming structure.

                  Sec. 78-45. - Coordination with federal law. 
                  Whenever the commissioner finds that the application of this article would unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services or prohibit, or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, minor variance compromise as set forth in this article may be granted. 
                  (Ord. No. O-2001-007, § 13, 9-20-2001)
                  Sec. 78-46. - Variance. 
                  If the proposed location, height, type, setback or other aspect of a telecommunications tower or antenna cannot comply with the preferred configurations or requirements set forth in this article, a variance permit shall be required for the construction of a tower or the placement of an antenna in the county. 
                  (1)	Requirements for obtaining a variance. 
                  a.	A nonpreferred telecommunications tower or antenna request shall require the applicant to demonstrate in writing to the satisfaction of the commissioner why the applicant cannot use the following: 
                  1.	An existing facility.
                  2.	A preferred location.
                  3.	A preferred configuration.
                  b.	In addition to the requirements set forth in subsection (1)a. of this section, the applicant shall also provide the following: 
                  1.	Collocation sites or other preferred location sites that are located within the geographic service area of the proposed site. 
                  2.	An explanation of good faith efforts and measures taken to secure each of the preferred location sites, and why each site is not technologically, legally or economically feasible for the applicant's needs. 
                  3.	How and why the proposed site is essential to meet service demands for the geographic service area it will cover and for the countywide network as a whole. 
                  c.	Applicants must identify all existing towers and all towers for which there are applications currently on file with the county or adjacent counties that could service the proposed search area. The applicant must provide evidence of the lack of space on all suitable existing towers. 
                  d.	The commissioner will review the variance request based on the justifications of undue expense and/or difficulties in entering into a lease agreement for collocation with a tower owner. The commissioner shall carefully weigh such claims, and the evidence presented in favor of them, against a facility's negative impacts at the proposed site and on the surrounding area. 
                  e.	The commissioner will indicate to the applicant within 30 days whether a request for a variance permit should be pursued. If the commissioner feels that the applicant's request does not justify a variance permit, then both parties may agree on a minor variance compromise in writing that satisfies all parties and this article. 
                  f.	At no time and under no circumstances shall the commissioner waive more than one of the preferred items (preferred location and preferred configuration) set forth in this article without requiring the applicant to apply for a variance permit. The commissioner shall charge an appropriate fee for county services and expenses in regards to the minor variance consideration, not to exceed $1,500.00. 
                  (2)	Acquisition procedures. 
                  a.	The cost of a variance permit shall be $1,500.00, plus any unusual or sustained costs that the commissioner shall deem necessary and appropriate. There shall be no limit to the unusual or sustained costs, except that they are actual and fair to all parties involved, and that they are agreed upon in writing prior to the execution of the variance process. In the event of unforeseen costs and expenses, both the commissioner and/or the applicant may amend their written agreement with both parties affirming the new agreement in writing. This process may repeat itself as long as both parties agree to it. 
                  b.	In granting a variance permit, the commissioner may impose conditions to the extent that he concludes are necessary to minimize adverse effects from the proposed tower on adjoining or nearby properties. 
                  c.	All engineering information that the applicant submits, whether civil, mechanical or electrical, shall be certified by a licensed professional engineer or qualified industry expert that is acceptable to the commissioner. The commissioner reserves the right to reject any expert or engineering submissions and request additional information from that or another source. 
                  d.	Each applicant requesting a variance permit shall submit a site plan, scaled elevation view and supporting drawings, calculations and other documentation, signed and sealed by appropriate licensed professionals or qualified industry experts, showing the location and dimensions of all structures and improvements, including topography, utilizing minimum two-foot contour intervals, tower height requirements, setbacks, access driveways or easements, parking, fencing, landscaping, adjacent uses and any other information deemed necessary by the commissioner to assess compliance with this article and compatibility with surrounding uses. 
                  e.	Before taking action upon a proposed variance permit, the commissioner shall hold a public hearing on the proposed variance permit. At least 30 days prior to the date of the public hearing, the commissioner shall cause the following notice requirements to be instituted: 
                  1.	A sign shall be erected in a conspicuous location on or adjacent to the property under consideration. The sign shall state the date, time, place, location and purpose of the public hearing. 
                  2.	A letter shall be sent by regular mail to all property owners of record of abutting parcels, giving notice of the public hearing. Owners of record shall be as indicated by the county tax commissioner's records. The letter shall at least state the same information as required in subsection (2)e.1. of this section for the erection of a sign. 
                  f.	A public hearing shall be held by the commissioner. The commissioner will gather all information and hear all reasonable positions, and then shall rule on the variance within 15 days of the public hearing. 
                  1.	If the variance is approved, the applicant may continue with the tower, provided, they observe all other ordinance rules and regulations that pertain to any nonvariance aspects of the tower construction and implementation. 
                  2.	If the variance is not approved, the commissioner will notify the applicant of such denial.
