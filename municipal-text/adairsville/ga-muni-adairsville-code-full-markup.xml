PREFACE

        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Adairsville, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1986 Code, the 1994 Code and the 2004 Code, as supplemented through June 10, 2004, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 2004 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Sandra S. Fox, Senior Code Attorney, and Jean Lindsay, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

                  The publisher is most grateful to Pamela L.

Amendments to the Charter are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended sections. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original act. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines, numbering, capitalization and citations to state statutes has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets.

Such acquisition may be through the acquisition of land and the construction thereon of a building, including the demolition of existing structures, or through the acquisition of an existing building and the remodeling, renovating, reconstructing, furnishing and equipping of such building; 
                  (6)  No building acquired hereunder shall be operated by the authority but shall be leased or sold to one or more persons, firms or corporations. If sold, the purchase price may be paid at one time or in installments falling due in not more than 30 years from the date of transfer of possession. The lessee or purchaser shall be required to pay all costs of operating and maintaining the building or buildings and to pay rentals or installments sufficient, together with other revenues which may be pledged for the purpose, to retire all bonds, both principal and interest, and to pay all other expenses which the authority may have incurred in connection with the undertaking;

Laws 1937, p. 761), as amended, Ga. Code Ann.

                  H.  Same. The authority may authorize additional bonds, for extensions and permanent improvements to any industrial building acquired hereunder, to be placed in escrow and to be negotiated from time to time as proceeds for that purpose may become necessary.

                  I.  Same. No bonds except refunding bonds shall be issued hereunder unless the authority shall have found and declared that: 
                  (1)  The undertaking for which the bonds are to be issued will increase employment within the territorial limits herein designated. 
                  (2)  The lessee or purchaser of the building or buildings involved will not by virtue of establishing operations in the territorial limits, reduce the number of employees employed by the lessee or purchaser elsewhere in the state. 
                  J.  Gifts. No moneys derived by the authority from any source other than gifts and contributions from private individuals, firms or corporations shall at any time be used for entertainment, or other promotional expenses. 
                  K.  Property. Should the authority for any reason be dissolved, title to all property of every kind and nature, real and personal, held by the authority at the time of such dissolution shall revert to the city subject to any mortgages, liens, leases or other encumbrances outstanding against or in respect to the property at that time. 
                  L.  Intent. This amendment is adopted for the purpose of promoting and expanding for the public good and welfare, industry and trade in the city and its vicinity and reducing unemployment to the greatest extent possible, and this amendment and any law enacted with reference to the authority shall be liberally construed for the accomplishment of these purposes. 
                  M.  Effective date. This amendment shall be effective immediately upon proclamation of its ratification by the governor and the first members of the authority shall be appointed within 30 days after such proclamation. 
                  N.  General assembly.

                  (a)  No officer or employee of the city shall purchase for and on behalf of the city any material or supplies, goods, wares or merchandise of any kind or character except through the department head; and no voucher, check or other method of payment shall be honored if this method is not followed. It shall be considered a breach of duty on the part of any officer or employee of the city to make any purchase, or aid and abet the making of any purchase in any other manner than through the department head; provided, however, that this section shall not apply to purchases as specifically provided in sections 2-288 and 2-289.

                  In order to expedite purchasing, each department head may make purchases of up to $1,000.00 without receiving a prior purchase order; however, this authority does not eliminate the necessity of having a requisition for each purchase.

                  In all cases where there is an immediate need for any material or supplies, goods, wares or merchandise by any department, such department shall write on its requisition to the finance department the words, "for emergency purposes." When a requisition so marked is received by the finance department it shall be their duty to give such requisition immediate attention.

In the event of a declaration of an emergency by the city, the city manager is authorized to make purchases on verbal request from any department head; and where necessary department heads are authorized to make purchases independent of the finance department. In such instances, such purchases shall be reported to the finance department as soon as the circumstances permit. 
                  Sec. 2-290. - Discretion to be exercised in making purchases where quality is involved.

                  (a)  The department head shall make no purchases that include any item, the price of which exceeds $1,000.00 but is less than $5,000.00 without the approval of the city manager, who may prescribe terms under which the purchases may be made. 
                  (b)  The department head shall make no purchase that includes any item the price of which exceeds $5,000.00 without the approval of the council, which may prescribe the terms under which the purchase may be made, including advertisement for bids. 
                  (c)  The department head shall be authorized to purchase any items which do not exceed $1,000.00 as he is requested to do so on behalf of the city by the department heads and/or the city manager. 
                  Sec. 2-292. - Authority to reject all bids and readvertise. 
                  Except where prohibited by law or by the wording of an advertisement for bids, the authority permitted to accept bids shall be permitted to reject all bids or parts of bids and readvertise for bids, where the public interest will be served thereby. 
                  Sec. 2-293. - Bids to be filed and subject to inspection. 
                  All bids for goods or materials of any kind or character purchased by the city shall be kept on file by the city clerk. After an award has been made, the bids shall be subject to inspection at any time during normal business hours by any citizen of the city. 
                  Sec. 2-294. - Electronic transmission of information. 
                  (a)  Electronic commerce shall include, but not limited to, on-line vendors registration, acceptance of bids and proposals by electronic mail, electronic or virtual purchasing malls and catalogs, notifications of solicitations and download capability and acceptance of electronic (digital) signatures. 
                  (b)  Notwithstanding any other provisions, this chapter applies to records generated, stored, processed, communicated, or used for any purpose by the city for purchasing, procurement, acquisition, services, or disposition of personal property. This shall apply to all city contracts except for public works contracts. 
                  (c)  The finance director or his designee is authorized to promulgate procedures to coordinate, create, implement, and facilitate the use of common approaches and technical infrastructure, as appropriate, to enhance the utilization of electronic commerce, electronic records, electronic signatures, and electronic security procedures by and for the city for these purposes. 
                  (d)  The finance director shall be authorized to develop, implement, and facilitate procedures for the use of electronic records, electronic signatures, and security procedures for all other purposes. The finance director is authorized to promulgate methods, means, and standards for secure electronic procurement transactions. 
                  Sec. 2-295. - Electronic signatures and records. 
                  (a)  An electronic record satisfies any rule requiring a document to be in writing. An electronic signature satisfies any rule of law requiring a signature. Any electronic record is signed as a matter of law if it contains a secure electronic signature. 
                  (b)  An electronic signature is deemed to be secure if it is created by application of a security procedure that is commercially reasonable and provided the electronic signature can be verified. Further, it is considered secure if it can be linked to the electronic record to which it relates in a manner such that, if the record is changed, the electronic signature is invalidated. 
                  (c)  An electronic record is deemed to be secure if it is created by application of a security procedure that is commercially reasonable and agreed to be the city. The electronic record will be deemed secure when it can be verified not to have been altered since a specified point in time.

The city council finds that the public interest requires that they protect against such conflicts of interest by establishing appropriate ethical standards with respect to the conduct of the members of the city council in situations where a conflict may exist.

                  (a)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.

                  (1)  Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on property values, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. 
                  (2)  Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from certain land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses and the surrounding area, and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area. 
                  (3)  Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the city's rationale for this article, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the city's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the city. The city finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this article are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.

                  (d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Code, a nonconforming sexually oriented business that is in all respects legally existing and operating prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived may continue to operate for two years following that date in order to make a reasonable recoupment of its investment in its current location. At the conclusion of said two years, the use will no longer be recognized as a lawful nonconforming use, provided that a nonconforming sexually oriented business may apply for one or more six-month extensions of the original two-year period upon a showing of financial hardship. An application for an initial extension based upon financial hardship ("hardship exception") shall be made at least 60 days before the conclusion of the aforementioned two-year period.

The unified zoning board shall issue a written decision within ten days after the public hearing on the application for a hardship extension. The hardship extension shall be granted upon a showing that the nonconforming sexually oriented business is unable to recoup its investments, made prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, in its current location unless the hardship extension is granted. 
                  (Ord. of 11-12-2015(01), § 4.5) 
                  Sec. 6-144. - Inspection. 
                  (a)  Sexually oriented businesses and sexually oriented business employees shall permit the director and his agents to inspect, from time to time on an occasional basis, the portions of the sexually oriented business premises where patrons are permitted, for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the specific regulations of this article, during those times when the sexually oriented business is occupied by patrons or is open to the public. This section shall be narrowly construed by the city to authorize reasonable inspections of the licensed premises pursuant to this article, but not to authorize a harassing or excessive pattern of inspections. 
                  (b)  The provisions of this section do not apply to areas of an adult motel which are currently being rented by a customer for use as a permanent or temporary habitation.

                  (a)  A person who knowingly violates, disobeys, omits, neglects, or refuses to comply with any of the provisions of this article shall, upon conviction, be punishable by fines not to exceed $1,000.00 per violation, or by imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment. Each day a violation is committed, or permitted to continue, shall constitute a separate offense and shall be fined as such. 
                  (b)  Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, the violation of provisions of this article by any person may be enjoined by instituting appropriate proceedings for injunction in any court of competent jurisdiction. 
                  (c)  This article does not impose strict liability. Unless a culpable mental state is otherwise specified herein, a showing of a knowing or reckless mental state is necessary to establish a violation of a provision of this article. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, for the purposes of this article, an act by an employee that constitutes grounds for suspension or revocation of that employee's license shall be imputed to the sexually oriented business licensee for purposes of finding a violation of this article, or for purposes of license denial, suspension, or revocation, only if an officer, director, or general partner, or a person who managed, supervised, or controlled the operation of the business premises, knowingly or recklessly allowed such act to occur on the premises. It shall be a defense to liability that the person to whom liability is imputed was powerless to prevent the act.

                  (b)  The city shall issue written intent to revoke a sexually oriented business license or a sexually oriented business employee license, as applicable, if:

                  (6)  The licensee has knowingly or recklessly committed a specified criminal activity on or through the licensed premises. 
                  (c)  The fact that any relevant conviction is being appealed shall have no effect on the revocation of the license, provided that, if any conviction which serves as a basis of a license revocation is overturned or reversed on appeal, that conviction shall be treated as null and of no effect for revocation purposes. 
                  (d)  When, after the notice and hearing procedure described in section 6-148, the director revokes a license, the revocation shall continue for one year and the licensee shall not be issued a sexually oriented business license or sexually oriented business employee license for one year from the date revocation becomes effective. 
                  (Ord. of 11-12-2015(01), § 5.3) 
                  Sec. 6-148. - Hearing; license denial, suspension, revocation; appeal. 
                  (a)  When the director issues a written notice of intent to deny, suspend, or revoke a license, the director shall immediately send such notice, which shall include the specific grounds under this article for such action, to the applicant or licensee (respondent) by personal delivery or certified mail.

The hearing shall take no longer than two days, unless extended at the request of the respondent to meet the requirements of due process and proper administration of justice. The board of zoning appeals shall issue a written decision, including specific reasons for the decision pursuant to this article, to the respondent within five business days after the hearing. 
                  (2)  If the decision is to deny, suspend, or revoke the license, the decision shall not become effective until the 30th day after it is rendered, and the decision shall include a statement advising the respondent of the right to appeal such decision to a court of competent jurisdiction. If the board of zoning appeals' decision finds that no grounds exist for denial, suspension, or revocation of the license, the board of zoning appeals shall, contemporaneously with the issuance of the decision, order the director to immediately withdraw the intent to deny, suspend, or revoke the license and to notify the respondent in writing by certified mail of such action. If the respondent is not yet licensed, the director shall contemporaneously therewith issue the license to the applicant.

                  (i)  Proper disposal. It shall be unlawful for any owner or custodian of any animal to fail to properly dispose of that animal upon its death. Proper disposal means in a method provided by the Georgia Code at O.C.G.A. § 4-5-5, and includes burning, incineration, burial or rendering of the carcass within 24 hours after death or discovery. Dead animals that are buried must be buried at least three feet below the ground level, have not less than three feet of earth over the carcass, and must not contaminate groundwater or surface water. 
                  (j)  Separate violation per animal. Each animal kept in violation of this section shall count as a separate violation. 
                  Sec. 8-42. - Sick, injured, or contagious animals. 
                  (a)  Impoundment of sick or injured animals. In any situation deemed appropriate by the animal control officer involving a sick or injured animal whose owner cannot be located and the condition of such animal is such that death or great suffering to the animal is likely, the animal control officer may take custody of such animal and may secure veterinary services for such animal. The owner of such animal shall be responsible for reimbursement of all expenses related to treatment and boarding of the animal. 
                  (b)  Destruction of sick or injured animals. Any sick or injured animal, deemed by a licensed veterinarian to be suffering to such an extent that the humane destruction of the animal is appropriate and the owner of the animal cannot be located, shall be humanely destroyed by the veterinarian in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 4-11-5.1. 
                  (c)  Infected or contagious animals. Any animal impounded by the animal control officer that is, in the opinion of a licensed veterinarian, infected with a disease likely to cause death or great suffering to the animal, or which is a contagious disease, or which will likely spread to other animals, shall be isolated and the owner of such animal shall be notified. If the owner cannot be located or the owner fails to take immediate steps to remove the animal from impoundment, the infected animal shall be humanely destroyed in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 4-11-5.1. 
                  (d)  Reimbursement. The owner of the animal shall be responsible for reimbursement to the county for all expenses involving the boarding, treatment and destruction of any such animal.

                  (f)  Impoundment and quarantine. The animal control officer shall be authorized to impound and quarantine dogs that have been bitten by wild animals or bitten by dogs or cats that do not have current records of vaccination against rabies. Management of animals exposed to rabies shall be according to the procedures set forth in the Georgia Rabies Control Manual, latest edition, which is incorporated herein by reference as if set forth fully herein. The protocols for livestock, dogs, cats and ferrets possibly exposed to rabies, as well as the protocols for animal to animal exposure and human exposure shall be enforced as set forth in the Georgia Rabies Control Manual, latest edition. The animal control officer shall be authorized to take any and all steps set forth in said manual up to and including euthanizing and testing of animals. 
                  (g)  Animals impounded for rabies quarantine. Animals impounded for rabies quarantine shall be isolated pursuant to the procedures of the Georgia Rabies Control Manual, latest edition. If the animal shows signs of rabies or dies during confinement, it will be sent off for testing. If the animal survives and does not show signs of rabies, it will be returned to the owner upon payment of fees. 
                  (h)  Quarantine/isolation procedures. In certain circumstances, the animal control officer may allow the animal owner to quarantine the animal that has been bitten in lieu of the animal being euthanized and tested. The quarantine period varies depending on the circumstance, as set forth in the Georgia Rabies Control Manual, latest edition. In that case, the animal must be placed in a secure enclosure where no other animal or person can be exposed to the virus which can be transmitted into bite wounds, open cuts in skin, and onto mucous membranes. The animal must be kept in a secure enclosure approved by the animal control department and when deemed necessary may require two layers of fencing, separated by at least one foot. Food must be pushed in from a distance, and the animal cannot be approached by any person. Other protocols for quarantine shall be provided by the animal control officer and the Bartow County Health Department. If the animal escapes from the enclosure, it will be impounded and euthanized for testing. 
                  Sec. 8-43. - Cruelty to animals. 
                  (a)  Cruelty to animals. It shall be unlawful for any person to willfully or maliciously strike, beat, abuse, intentionally run down with a vehicle, or cause or inflict unnecessary pain, injury, suffering or death to an animal through any act, omission or willful neglect, except that reasonable force may be used to defend his own person or property, or the person or property of another, from injury or damage being caused by a dog; or kill any dog causing injury or damage to any livestock, poultry, or pet animal as authorized by Georgia law, O.C.G.A. § 4-8-5.

In the case of activities where physical pain is necessarily caused, such as medical and scientific research, food processing, customary and normal veterinary and agricultural husbandry practices, pest elimination, and animal training and hunting, failure to employ the most humane method reasonably available shall constitute cruelty to animals and shall be unlawful. 
                  Secs. 8-44—8-64. - Reserved. 
                  DIVISION 3. - DANGEROUS ANIMALS 

                  Sec. 8-65. - Restraint of guard or attack dogs. 
                  (a)  Confine guard or attack dog. Every owner of a guard or attack dog shall keep such dog confined in a building, compartment, or other secure enclosure. Any such enclosure shall be completely surrounded by a fence at least six feet in height and shall be topped with an anti-climbing device.

                  (b)  Government exemption. The provisions of this section shall not apply to dogs owned or controlled by government law enforcement agencies. 
                  Sec. 8-66. - Dog classification. 
                  (a)  Classification levels. The term "classified dog" means any dog that has been classified as either a dangerous or vicious dog pursuant to this article. Classifications are as follows: 
                  (1)  Dangerous dog. Any dog that: 
                  a.  Causes a substantial puncture of a person's skin by teeth without causing serious injury (see section 8-13); provided, however, that a nip, scratch, or abrasion shall not be sufficient to classify a dog as dangerous under this subsection; 
                  b.  Aggressively attacks in a manner that causes a person to reasonably believe that the dog posed an imminent threat of serious injury (see section 8-13) to such a person or another person although no such injury occurs; provided, however, that the acts of barking, growling, or showing of teeth by a dog shall not be sufficient to classify a dog as dangerous under this subsection; or 
                  c.  While off the owner's property, kills a pet animal; provided, however, that this subsection shall not apply where the death of such pet animal is caused by a dog that is working or training as a hunting dog, herding dog, or predator control dog. 
                  (2)  Vicious dog. Any dog that inflicts a serious injury on a person or causes serious injury (see section 8-13) to a person resulting from reasonable attempts to escape the dog's attack. 
                  (3)  Euthanasia for causing serious injury on more than one occasion. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 4-8-26, a dog that is found, after notice and opportunity for hearing as provided below, to have caused a serious injury to a human on more than one occasion shall be euthanized; provided, however, that no injury occurring before July 1, 2012, shall count for purposes of this subsection. 
                  (4)  Judge authorized to order euthanasia. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 4-8-25, the judge of any superior court of competent jurisdiction within this state may order the euthanasia of a dog if the court finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing as provided by this section, that the dog has seriously injured a human or presents a danger to humans not suitable for control under this article and: 
                  a.  The owner or custodian of the dog has been convicted of a violation of any state criminal law and the crime was related to such dog; or 
                  b.  Any local governmental authority has filed with the court a civil action requesting the euthanasia of the dog. 
                  (5)  Previously classified animals. Any dog classified prior to July 1, 2012, as a potentially dangerous dog in this state shall on and after that date be classified as a dangerous dog. Any dog classified prior to July 1, 2012, as a dangerous dog or vicious dog in this state shall on and after that date be classified as a vicious dog under this chapter. The owner of any dog classified prior to July 1, 2012, shall come into compliance with all current provisions of this chapter by January 1, 2013. 
                  (b)  Confiscation. If an animal control officer has reason to believe that a dog has acted in a manner that justifies a classification as a dangerous dog or a vicious dog, the dog may be confiscated, impounded, classified, and notice provided as set forth below. A law enforcement officer or animal control officer shall immediately impound a dog if the officer believes the dog poses a threat to the public safety. 
                  (c)  Exceptions. An animal shall not be classified within the meaning of this section if it inflicts injury upon a person when the animal is being used by a law enforcement officer or military officer to carry out the law enforcement or military officer's official duties. No dog shall be classified as a dangerous or vicious dog if the person injured by such dog was a person who, at the time, was: 
                  (1)  Committing a trespass; 
                  (2)  Was abusing the dog; or 
                  (3)  Was committing or attempting to commit an offense under O.C.G.A. title 16, ch. 5. 
                  (d)  Classification by animal control. The animal control officer shall make a determination whether the dog shall be classified as a dangerous dog or vicious dog. The owner shall be given notice of the classification pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. If an owner is unknown or cannot be found, notice shall be made by posting the notice in a conspicuous place at the location where the animal was confiscated. 
                  (e)  Notice of determination. The notice to the owner shall meet the following requirements: 
                  (1)  The notice shall be in writing and mailed by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery to the owner's last known address within 72 hours, and notice shall be complete upon mailing; 
                  (2)  The notice shall include a summary of the animal control officer's findings that formed the basis for the dog's classification as a dangerous dog or vicious dog; 
                  (3)  The notice shall be dated and shall state that the owner, within 15 days after the date shown on the notice, has a right to request an appeal hearing on the animal control officer's classification of the dog; 
                  (4)  The notice shall state that the hearing, if requested, shall be before the Bartow County Animal Control Board; 
                  (5)  The notice shall state that if a hearing is not requested, the classification of the dog as a dangerous dog or vicious dog will become effective for all purposes under this chapter on a date specified in the notice, which shall be after the last day on which the owner has a right to request a hearing; and 
                  (6)  The notice shall include a form to request a hearing and shall provide specific instructions on mailing or delivering such request to animal control. 
                  (f)  Response to notice. If no owner comes forward in response to the notice provided in subsection (e) of this section, the animal shall be kept for five days, and then may be disposed of by animal control, including by humane destruction in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 4-11-5.1. If the owner comes forward and no appeal hearing is requested, the animal may be returned to the owner provided the owner complies with the requirements of this division, including payment of fees set forth in subsection (j) of this section and the requirements of section 8-67. If a hearing is requested, the provisions of subsection (g) of this section shall apply. 
                  (g)  Appeal hearing. When the animal control board receives a proper and timely request for an appeal hearing of a classification, it shall schedule such hearing within 30 days after receiving the request; however, such hearing may be continued by the authority for good cause shown. The board shall notify the dog owner in writing by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery of the date, time, and place of the hearing, and such notice shall be mailed to the dog owner at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing. At the hearing, the owner of the dog shall be given the opportunity to testify and present evidence, and in addition thereto, the governing authority or board shall receive such other evidence and hear such other testimony as the governing authority or board may find reasonably necessary to make a determination either to sustain, modify, or overrule the animal control officer's classification of the dog, including the power to impose conditions on continued possession of the dog. 
                  (h)  Decision. After hearing the evidence, the animal control board shall be empowered to take the following actions: 
                  (1)  Sustain the animal control officer's classification; 
                  (2)  Modify the animal control officer's classification; 
                  (3)  Overrule the animal control officer's classification; 
                  (4)  Impose conditions or restrictions in addition to the required conditions set forth in this chapter for keeping a classified dog; or 
                  (5)  Order that the dog be euthanized pursuant to subsection (a)(3) of this section if the requirements are met. 
                  (i)  Notice of decision. The decision shall be made at the hearing, and within ten days after the date of the hearing, the animal control board shall notify the dog owner in writing by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery of its determination on the matter. If such determination is that the dog is a dangerous dog or vicious dog, the notice shall specify the date upon which that determination is effective. Any specific additional conditions or restrictions shall be set forth in the notice. If the determination is that the dog is to be euthanized pursuant to subsection (a)(3) of this section, the notice shall specify the date by which the euthanasia shall occur. 
                  (j)  Return to owner. In the event the dog is classified as dangerous or vicious dog, (and the dog is not ordered euthanized), the animal shall not be returned to the owner until payment of reasonable confiscation costs, including an impoundment fee of $100.00, boarding costs of $15.00 per day, and all actual veterinary care costs. In the event the owner has not complied with the provisions of this subsection and also satisfied the requirements set forth in section 8-67 within ten days of the date the dog was classified, said dog shall be destroyed in an expeditious and humane manner in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 4-11-5.1; provided, however, upon a showing for good cause, the director of animal control may extend said time, up to an additional 15 days, upon the payment by the owner of the per diem boarding costs for said dog. In the event the dog is ordered euthanized, the animal shall be humanely destroyed any time after five business days after the date of the decision of the animal control board in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 4-11-5.1. 
                  (k)  Judicial review. Judicial review of the animal control board's final decision may be had in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 50-13-19, except that venue shall be limited to the Bartow County Superior Court. The filing of the petition for judicial review in superior court does not itself stay enforcement of the board's decision. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the animal control director may grant, or the reviewing court may order, a stay upon appropriate terms for good cause shown. 
                  Sec. 8-67. - Requirements for possessing a classified dog. 
                  (a)  Unlawful without certificate.

Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 4-8-31, under no circumstances shall the city or any animal control officer be held liable for any damages to any person who suffers an injury inflicted by a dog as a result of failure to enforce the provisions of this division.

In the event the owner has not complied with the provisions of this section within 20 days of the date the dog was confiscated, said dog shall be destroyed in an expeditious and humane manner in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 4-11-5.1; provided, however, upon a showing for good cause, the director of animal control may extend said time, up to an additional 15 days, upon the payment by the owner of the per diem boarding costs for said dog.

                  Sec. 8-83. - Notice of impoundment; procedures. 
                  (a)  Specific impoundments. Impoundment for violation of section 8-41(a) (failure to provide humane care) or section 8-43 (cruelty to animals), or for violations of O.C.G.A. § 16-12-4 (cruelty to animals) or 16-12-37 (dogfighting), shall be subject to the following procedures: 
                  (1)  Veterinary determination. A licensed, accredited veterinarian approved according to O.C.G.A. § 4-11-9.2(d) shall examine and determine the condition or treatment of the animal prior to impoundment. 
                  (2)  Notice. Notice shall be provided to the owner and shall include the description of the animal, the location where the animal was impounded, the reason for impoundment, the citation number if a citation was issued, the name and business address of the officer impounding the animal, the name and business location of the animal shelter, the hours during which the animal can be reclaimed, and fees to be charged to the owner. The notice shall state that the failure to claim the animal or request a hearing as hereinafter provided within five business days following the date notice was provided may result in the disposition of the animal. The notice shall be delivered personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested. If an owner is unknown or cannot be found, notice shall be made by posting the notice in a conspicuous place at the location where the animal was impounded. In addition, if the owner is unknown, notice shall be published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county. 
                  (3)  Appeal hearing. If an animal is impounded pursuant to section 8-41(a) or 8-43 and the owner thereof refuses to enter into a consent agreement with the animal shelter that such animal will be given humane care and adequate and necessary veterinary care, the owner may request, in writing, a hearing within five business days of the date the notice of impoundment was served on such owner, or, if the owner is unknown or could not be found, within 30 days of the date of publication of the notice of impoundment in a newspaper of general circulation in the county. Hearing shall be in accordance with section 8-84. Such request for hearing shall be served upon the animal shelter. If no hearing is requested within the time limits herein specified and the failure to request such hearing is due in whole or in part to the reasonably avoidable fault of the owner, the right to a hearing shall have been waived. For impoundments under state charges, see subsection (c) of this section. 
                  (4)  Consent agreement. Prior to release of an animal impounded under these provisions, the owner must enter into a consent agreement providing that, among other things, the animal will be given humane care and veterinary treatment; the animal will not be subject to mistreatment or illegal activity; and the owner will comply with all terms of this chapter. Animal control may specify additional terms as required. 
                  (b)  Impoundment for other reasons. Impoundments for reasons other than specified in subsection (a) of this section shall be subject to the following procedures: 
                  (1)  Determination. The animal control officer shall make a determination whether the animal should be impounded under this chapter. 
                  (2)  Notice. Notice shall be provided to the owner and shall include the description of the animal, the location where the animal was impounded, the reason for impoundment, the citation number if a citation was issued, the name and business address of the officer impounding the animal, the name and business location of the animal shelter, the hours during which the animal can be reclaimed, and fees to be charged to the owner. The notice shall state that the failure to claim the animal or request a hearing as hereinafter provided within five business days following the date notice was provided may result in the disposition of the animal. The notice shall be delivered personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested. If an owner is unknown or cannot be found, notice shall be made by posting the notice in a conspicuous place at the location where the animal was impounded. 
                  (3)  Reclaim animal. The owner of an impounded animal, unless otherwise specified in this chapter, shall have the option to pay the violation fines and impoundment fines and retrieve the dogs, once the condition or circumstance causing the impoundment has been cured or corrected. Owners shall have no more than five days from the date of notice to cure or correct the violation, or the dogs shall be deemed unclaimed; this time limit may be extended by animal control, to no more than 20 days. Return to the owner upon payment of fees shall not be an option for animals that are a threat to public safety or health, require quarantine, or where impounded for cruelty, inhumane treatment, dogfighting, other illegal action, vicious attacks, or other circumstances requiring a hearing under this chapter. 
                  (4)  Appeal hearing. The animal owner may request, in writing, a hearing within five business days of the date the notice of impoundment was served on such owner or being posted in the case of abandoned dogs. Hearings shall be in accordance with section 8-84. Such request for hearing shall be served upon the animal shelter. If no hearing is requested within the time limits herein specified and the failure to request such hearing is due in whole or in part to the reasonably avoidable fault of the owner, the right to a hearing shall have been waived. 
                  (5)  Consent agreement. Prior to release of an animal impounded under these provisions, the owner must enter into a consent agreement providing that, among other things, the animal will be given humane care and veterinary treatment; the animal will not be subject to mistreatment or illegal activity; and the owner will comply with all terms of this chapter. Animal control may specify additional terms as required. 
                  (c)  Criminal matters; bond. The provisions of subsections (a)(4) or (b)(5) of this section shall not apply to an animal that was an object or instrumentality of a crime nor shall any such animal be returned to the owner without the approval of the prosecuting attorney and animal control. If dogs are impounded for violation of O.C.G.A. § 16-12-4 (cruelty to animals) or 16-12-37 (dogfighting), they shall not be returned to the owner until the case is completed, or unless otherwise ordered by the court. In such cases, the owner shall be required to post a surety bond for the costs of impoundment of the dog for the duration of the proceeding, in the amount of $2,500.00 per animal impounded, or shall release the animals to animal control for disposal. The surety bond shall be issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in this state, or the bond may be paid in cash. If bond is not posted within 30 days of impoundment, animal control shall apply to the court for permission to dispose of the animal prior to trial of the criminal case as provided by law. 
                  (d)  Owners liable for fees. In the event an animal is not claimed from impoundment and is therefore destroyed or the animal otherwise dies, and the owner is known, the owner shall still be responsible for the impoundment charges, including boarding fees and veterinary care costs, for the period the animal was held. 
                  Sec. 8-84. - Appeal hearings on impoundments. 
                  Within 30 days after receiving a written request for a hearing, the animal control board shall hold a hearing following the procedures established in this chapter: 
                  (1)  The scope of the hearing shall be limited to whether the impounding of the animal was authorized under this chapter or state law; 
                  (2)  If the board finds that the animal was improperly impounded, the animal shall be returned to the owner and the costs incurred in providing reasonable care and treatment for the animal from the date of impoundment to the date of the order shall not be charged to the owner. If the animal is impounded under contract with a third party, the animal shelter shall pay for such costs of boarding and treatment; 
                  (3)  If the board finds that the animal was lawfully impounded, the board may: 
                  a.  Recommend the shelter dispose of the animal in accordance with this section; or 
                  b.  Unless, in a prior administrative or legal action, the owner has been found to have failed to provide humane care to an animal, committed cruelty to animals, or engaged in dogfighting in violation of the laws of this state or of the United States or any of the several states, recommend conditions under which the animal may, upon payment by the owner of all costs of impoundment and care, be returned to the owner. 
                  Such conditions shall be reduced to writing and served upon the owner and the animal shelter. 
                  Sec. 8-85. - Return of animal to owner. 
                  (a)  Return of animals at large. If the name of the owner of an animal found at large is known or can be obtained with reasonable dispatch, and there are no other violations of this chapter, the animal control officer shall return the animal to the residential address of the owner. If there is no one present, the officer shall impound the animal and leave written notice of whom the owner must contact to reclaim the animal. The owner shall be cited for violation of this chapter. 
                  (b)  Return of animals with violations. If an animal is impounded for a violation, and the procedure for return is not otherwise specified in this chapter or a hearing is not otherwise requested or required, the animal shall be returned once all fees for the violation and impoundment are paid and the conditions necessitating the impoundment have been cured or corrected, if applicable. 
                  (c)  Impoundment fees. An owner reclaiming an impounded animal shall pay a $30.00 impoundment fee plus a fee of $15.00 for each day the animal is impounded as a boarding fee if impounded at the shelter (or the actual costs of impoundment if impounded off-site), and the actual veterinary costs for care of the animal. 
                  (d)  Second impoundment. An owner reclaiming an impounded animal for a second impoundment within one year shall pay a $60.00 impoundment fee, plus a fee of $15.00 for each day the animal is impounded as a boarding fee (or the actual costs of impoundment if impounded off-site), plus any actual veterinary costs for care of the animal. 
                  (e)  Third and subsequent impoundment. An owner reclaiming an impounded animal for a third or subsequent impoundment within one year shall pay a $120.00 impoundment fee, plus a fee of $15.00 for each day the animal is impounded as a boarding fee (or the actual costs of impoundment if impounded off-site), plus any actual veterinary costs for care of the animal. 
                  Sec. 8-86. - Unclaimed animals. 
                  (a)  Disposal of unclaimed animals. Except as provided below, after five business days, any animal unclaimed by its owner, after such owner has been notified of the impoundment of such animal or the conclusion of proceedings before the animal control board, shall be placed for adoption or humanely destroyed in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 4-11-5.1. 
                  (b)  Disposal of animals without known owners. Except as provided below, after five business days, any animal whose owner cannot be ascertained shall be placed for adoption or humanely destroyed in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 4-11-5.1. 
                  (c)  Disposal of animals without known owners for certain specific violations. If the animal has been impounded pursuant to section 8-83(a) of this chapter and if the owner is unknown or could not be found within 30 days of publication of the notice of impoundment, the animal shelter may dispose of the animal through sale by any commercially feasible means, at a public auction or by sealed bids. If in the opinion of a licensed accredited veterinarian or a veterinarian employed by the state or federal government any animal impounded pursuant to this chapter has a temperament or condition such that euthanasia is the only reasonable course of action, the animal shelter shall dispose of the animal in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 4-11-5.1. 
                  (d)  Owners liable for fees. In the event an animal is not claimed from impoundment and is therefore destroyed or the animal otherwise dies, and the owner is known, the owner shall still be responsible for the impoundment charges, including boarding fees and veterinary care costs, for the period the animal was held. 
                  Sec. 8-87. - Sterilization of dogs and cats placed for adoption.

                  (b)  Costs. All costs of sterilization incurred by the animal shelter or a humane society shall be included in any fees charged by the animal shelter or humane society for such animal. 
                  (c)  Written agreement. Every person adopting a dog or cat shall enter into a written agreement at the time of the adoption with the animal shelter or humane society guaranteeing that sterilization will be performed by a licensed veterinarian within 30 days after the acquisition of such animal in the case of an adult animal or within 30 days of the sexual maturity of the animal in the case of an immature animal. Failure to comply with this agreement shall be a violation for each day beyond 30. 
                  (d)  Evidence required. Any person acquiring an animal from the animal shelter or humane society, which animal is not sterile at the time of acquisition, shall submit to the animal shelter or humane society a signed statement from the licensed veterinarian performing the sterilization required by subsection (a) of this section within seven days after such sterilization attesting that such sterilization has been performed. 
                  (e)  List of veterinarians. The animal shelter or humane society shall maintain and furnish to any person acquiring an animal a current list of veterinarians who have notified the animal shelter or humane society that they are willing to perform sterilization and the cost for such procedures. 
                  Sec. 8-88. - Variances; appeals. 
                  (a)  Variances. Variances may be granted by animal control in cases where undue hardship would result from the strict enforcement of this chapter and where the protection of the health and wellbeing of the citizens of Bartow County can be achieved with reasonable mitigating actions. Hardships created by action of the applicant shall not be considered as a justification for a variance. Denial of a request for a variance may be appealed to the animal control board by filing a notice of appeal specifying the grounds for appeal with the animal control board within 15 days of the denial. 
                  (b)  Notice of variance appeal. Persons who appeal to the animal control board the denial of a variance from any requirement of this chapter shall notify adjacent property owners of their application for a variance and the time and location of the hearing on the variance appeal. Adjacent property owners shall be determined by the records of the tax assessor, on the date of the application for variance. 
                  (c)  Appeals. Any person aggrieved by any decision of an animal control officer or other enforcement officer as it pertains to the classification of a dog, a confiscation of a vicious dog, status as or requirements for maintaining wild or exotic animals, or the calculation of costs may appeal the same to the animal control board by filing an appeal with the board on forms furnished by animal control, within five days of receiving notice of the decision. 
                  (d)  Abandonment of appeal. Any person who files an appeal but who, after receipt of notice of the hearing, fails to appear at said hearing shall be deemed to have abandoned the appeal, and the decision of the animal control officer shall be affirmed. 
                  (e)  Fees for boarding. The owner filing an appeal shall pay the additional daily boarding fees as established in this chapter during the pendency of the appeal. Failure to pay the fees and costs accessed against the owner, if affirmed by the board, shall constitute an abandonment of any claim to the animal and will result in the animal being placed for adoption or euthanized. 
                  (f)  Finality. All decisions of the board are final.

                  Animal control officers may apply for search and seizure warrants, or inspection warrants, pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 2-2-11 when they reasonably believe a violation of section 8-41(a) or 8-43 is occurring.

                  Sec. 8-123. - Violations and penalties; remedies.

                  (Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.21) 
                  Sec. 10-41. - Pending violations and stop-work orders. 
                  No building permit shall be issued to any applicant currently in violation of this article or any other ordinance of the city. No building permit shall be issued to any applicant currently subject to a stop-work order under this article or any other ordinance of the city. 
                  (Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.22) 
                  Sec. 10-42. - Installation of industrialized homes. 
                  Construction of industrialized homes is regulated by the state department of community affairs and not this article. However, installation of homes must meet manufacturer's specifications and the specifications of the zoning ordinance before permanent utilities may be installed. An installation permit must be obtained prior to installation, and an inspection must occur of the installation, including utility connections and foundation, prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
                  (1)  Installation requirements. Industrialized homes must be installed in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 8-2-110 et seq. and regulations promulgated thereunder. 
                  (2)  Utility connections. Utility connections prior to the final inspection of the installation will be considered temporary and will be approved only when arrangements for complete installations have been made. 
                  (3)  Entry landing. All industrialized home installations shall provide an adequate means of entry (including steps and a landing at each doorway). 
                  (4)  Sewage management. A septic permit or a sewer tap must be secured and provided to building inspections before an installation permit for an industrialized home will be permitted. 
                  (5)  Foundations. The dwelling must be placed on a foundation and a curtain wall, unpierced except for required ventilation and access, and must be installed so that it encloses the area located under the home to ground level. Such a wall shall have a minimum thickness of four inches and shall be constructed of masonry or similar material as approved by the building official. 
                  (Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.23) 
                  Sec. 10-43. - Swimming pools. 
                  Any swimming pool shall be enclosed with a fence that is in compliance with the state minimum standard code (International Residential Code) and shall comply with the requirements of the zoning ordinance. Public swimming pools must also comply with applicable regulations of the county board of health. 
                  (Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.24) 
                  Sec. 10-44. - Moved houses. 
                  A house moved into or to another location in city must have the necessary improvements made so as to be in compliance with the state minimum standard codes that are in effect for new construction at the time the home is placed in its new location. Where any particular improvements that would be required to the moved house are technically unfeasible or impractical, or would be cost prohibitive (especially in relation to the benefit received or the purpose, goal, or intent of the standard or regulation at issue), a written request may be made to the building official requesting a recommendation that the exemption from the particular standard or requirement be granted and detailing why the request for exemption should be granted. Upon receiving the recommendation from the building official, the community development director may grant or deny the exemption. Any denial may be appealed to the unified zoning board. The exemption granted should not impair the public safety purposes of the state minimum standard codes and should be the minimum necessary. 
                  (Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.25) 
                  Sec. 10-45. - Prohibited exterior materials; temporary repair exception. 
                  It shall be unlawful to use roof or wall covering material that has not been approved by the applicable building code as exterior covering material except in the event a building is damaged by natural or manmade disaster or suffers a roof leak, other leak, or other damage. In such cases, temporary materials may be applied to a building to provide a temporary repair for no more than 60 days from the date of the damage. One 60-day extension can be requested from the building official, for cause, if the structure is not able to be properly repaired with approved exterior covering material within 60 days. Examples of materials that are not approved as exterior covering materials include, but are not limited to, tarpaulins, plastic sheeting, and OSB. This restriction shall not apply to a building that would not require a building permit to construct, such as outbuildings and storage buildings. 
                  (Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.26) 
                  Sec. 10-46. - Partially-built structures. 
                  The city finds that partially-built and subsequently abandoned homes and other buildings and structures are occurring more frequently and are an aesthetic harm to the community; they also reduce property values of adjacent and nearby property; they create a public safety hazard in that they can be dangerous; and they invite illicit activity. The city finds such structures to be a nuisance. Therefore, it shall be unlawful for a property owner to leave a residential, commercial or industrial structure in a partially-built status for more than six months with no substantial progress occurring on the construction. Partially-built means foundations that are poured or erected, basements that have been dug and partially completed, and structures that have been framed or dried-in (siding, roofing, windows and doors in place) but not completed. It shall be permissible to finish the exterior of a commercial shopping center or other commercial or industrial building without building-out the inside. It shall also be a violation for a partially completed building or structure to remain unfinished without a certificate of occupancy more than 30 days after the expiration of its building permit (building permits expire one year from issuance unless extended). The building official shall be authorized to issue citations to the property owner or builder and shall be authorized to seek abatement of the nuisance in municipal court or superior court. 
                  (Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.27) 
                  Sec. 10-47. - Commercial car washes. 
                  Any commercial conveyor car wash (as defined herein) that is permitted and constructed shall install a recycled water system which captures and reuses water previously used in wash or rinse cycles. A minimum of 50 percent of the water utilized shall be recycled. A "commercial conveyor car wash" is a commercial car wash where the car moves on a conveyor belt during the wash (regardless of whether the driver remains in the vehicle or not). These restrictions shall not apply to self-service car wash bays or in-bay car washes where the car remains stationary and the wash equipment moves around the vehicle. 
                  (Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.28) 
                  Sec. 10-48. - Retaining walls. 
                  (a)  Permit required. A building permit shall be required for any retaining wall that exceeds three feet in exposed wall height or exceeds two feet in exposed wall height and supports a surcharge. A building permit application shall require a site plan showing the location, extent, and height of the retaining wall in relation to any building structure, pool, property lines, and public utility easements. It shall also require complete construction details of the retaining wall and structural calculations for the wall, both stamped and signed by a professional engineer. 
                  (b)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Exposed wall height means the vertical distance measure from the finish grade at the bottom of the wall (lower soil grade) to the finish grade at the top of the wall (upper soil grade). This height does not include the wall and depth of footing below grade. 
                  Retaining wall means a wall designed to resist lateral earth and/or fluid pressures, including any surcharge, in accordance with accepted engineering practice. 
                  Surcharge means a vertical load imposed on the retained soil that may impose a lateral force in addition to the lateral earth pressure of the retained soil. Examples of surcharges include sloping retained soil, structure footings supported by the retained soil, adjacent vehicle loads supported by the retained soil, and solid fences that are attached or directly adjacent to a retaining wall when wind pressures act on the fence. 
                  (c)  Tiered retaining walls. Use of tiered walls is a special condition where two or more short walls, horizontally offset from one another, are used in lieu of a single tall retaining wall. When tiered walls are not properly offset from each other, the upper wall may impose a surcharge condition on the lower wall. In order for the walls to be treated as separate retaining walls, a general rule of thumb is that the tiered walls be horizontally offset by a minimum distance of two times the exposed wall height of the lower wall. For example, two tiered retaining walls, each with an exposed wall height of three feet and level backfill, which are horizontally offset by a distance of two feet, would be treated as a single six-foot-tall wall. As a result, a building permit would be required.

                  Sec. 10-49. - Permits. 
                  The building official is authorized to issue permits under the state minimum standard codes and to make inspections in relation to enforcing and administering those codes and this article. 
                  (Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.30) 
                  Sec. 10-50. - Exemptions. 
                  A building permit shall not be required for the following structures or mechanical work: 
                  (1)  A stand-alone or detached personal storage building or personal garage which is less than 800 square feet and will not be used for income producing activities nor as living quarters; 
                  (2)  A structure used for housing animals, poultry, etc., or for other agricultural practices, which is not open to the public; 
                  (3)  Any portable heating appliance; 
                  (4)  Any portable ventilation equipment; 
                  (5)  Any portable cooling unit; 
                  (6)  Any steam, hot or chilled water piping within any heating or cooling equipment regulated by the code; 
                  (7)  Replacement of any part which does not alter its approval or make it unsafe; 
                  (8)  Any portable evaporative cooler; or 
                  (9)  Any self-contained refrigeration system containing ten pounds (4.54 kg.) or less of refrigerant and actuated by motors of one horsepower (746 W) or less.

                  Sec. 10-51. - Minor repairs exempted. 
                  Ordinary minor repairs may be made without a permit, provided that such repairs shall not violate any of the provisions of the state minimum standard codes. 
                  (Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.32) 
                  Sec. 10-52. - Applications and review. 
                  All applicants for a building permit shall submit an application as required, with the information specified in this article and such other information as is required. The building official shall examine or cause to be examined each application for a permit and the accompanying documents, consisting of drawings, specifications, computations, or such other data as is required by the building official, and shall ascertain by such examinations whether the construction appears to be in accordance with the requirements of the state minimum standard codes and all other pertinent laws or ordinances. 
                  (Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.33) 
                  Sec. 10-53. - Permit decision. 
                  The building official shall act upon an application for a permit without unreasonable or unnecessary delay within 30 days from the submission of an application deemed complete. If the building official is satisfied that the work described in an application for a permit and the contract documents filed therewith conform to the requirements of the state minimum standard codes and other pertinent laws and ordinances, he shall issue a permit to the applicant. 
                  (Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.34) 
                  Sec. 10-54. - Permit issuance. 
                  When the building official issues a permit that requires plans to be submitted, he shall endorse, in writing or by stamp, both sets of plans: "Reviewed for Issuance of Construction Permit." One set of drawings so reviewed shall be retained by the building official, and the other set shall be returned to the applicant. The permitted drawings shall be kept at the site of work and shall be open to inspection by the building official or his authorized representative. In the event the particular permit does not require plans to be submitted, only a copy of the permit shall be kept by the building official. 
                  (Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.35) 
                  Sec. 10-55. - Permit duration. 
                  A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not as authority to violate, cancel, alter, or set aside any of the provisions of the state minimum standard codes, nor shall issuance of a permit prevent the building official from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction, or violations of this article. Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is completed within 12 months after its issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of 12 months after the time the work is commenced. One or more extensions of time, for periods not more than 12 months, may be allowed for the permit. 
                  (Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.36) 
                  Sec. 10-56. - Permit posted. 
                  Work requiring a permit shall not commence until the permit holder or his agent posts the permit card in a conspicuous place on the premises. Such permits must be placed on a post or other structure at least three feet off the ground and no more than two feet back from the right-of-way, so as to be easily visible to the inspectors and passersby. The permittee shall be responsible for ensuring a clear and legible permit is on display at all times. If permit is not properly posted, no scheduled inspections will occur, and a re-inspection fee will be charged before any further inspections will be scheduled. In the event of damage or loss, a replacement permit shall be immediately obtained and displayed. This permit card shall be maintained in such position by the permit holder until the certificate of occupancy or completion is issued by the building official. 
                  (Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.37) 
                  Sec. 10-57. - Denial of permit. 
                  If the application for a permit and the accompanying contract documents describing the work do not conform to the requirements of the state minimum standard codes or other pertinent laws or ordinances, the building official shall not issue a permit, but shall return the contract documents to the applicant with his refusal to issue such permit. Such refusal shall, when requested, be in writing and shall contain the reason for refusal. Appeals shall be to the unified zoning board. 
                  (Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.38) 
                  Sec. 10-58. - Compliance with licensing requirements. 
                  It shall be the duty of every contractor who contracts for the installation or repairs of buildings, structures, or electrical, gas, mechanical, sprinkler or plumbing systems, for which a permit is required, to comply with all state or local rules and regulations concerning licensing. In cases where the state requires a contractor to have obtained a state license before they are permitted to perform work, the contractor shall supply the building official with their license number before receiving a permit for work to be performed. 
                  (Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.40)

                  Each application for a permit, along with the required fee, shall be filed with the building official on a form furnished for that purpose, and shall contain a general description of the proposed work and its location. The application shall be signed by the owner, or his authorized agent. The building permit application shall indicate the proposed occupancy of all parts of the building and of that portion of the site or lot, if any, not covered by the building or structure. The application shall provide such information as is required to confirm compliance with this article and applicable codes and shall be accompanied by drawings or site plans as are required for these purposes. Issuance of a building permit is not a guaranty that the erection of the structure is lawful and in compliance with all other applicable ordinances.

                  Sec. 10-64. - Professional certification. 
                  The design professional shall be an architect registered under the laws of this state regulating the practice of architecture and shall affix his official seal to the drawings, specifications and accompanying data, for the design, construction, enlargement, or alteration of a building or group of buildings and the space within and surrounding such buildings, which may have human occupancy or habitation: planning, providing preliminary studies, designs, drawings, specifications and other technical submissions, the architectural administering of construction contracts, and coordinating elements of technical submissions prepared by others including, as appropriate and without limitation, consulting engineers, registered interior designers, and landscape architects. As part of the practice of architecture, a registered architect may perform such engineering work as is incidental to his work. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a licensed engineer from coordinating technical submittals related to the practice of engineering. 
                  (Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.46) 
                  Sec. 10-65. - Exemption from professional certification. 
                  The state requires certain buildings to have the seal of an architect on the plans, and the architect must have a current registration to practice in this state and be competent in the subject matter of the documents by virtue of experience or education or both. Certain structures are exempt from the seal of an architect. Such requirements are governed by O.C.G.A. § 43-4-1 et seq. For information purposes only, the following summary of exemptions is provided, but the state law controls this requirement: 
                  (1)  One- and two-family residences and domestic outbuildings; 
                  (2)  Any building classified as an agricultural occupancy upon any farm for the use of any farmer; any state-owned farmer's market;

Fines may be increased by mandatory add-ons under state law. As a deterrent to violation, second and subsequent violations by the same offender of any provision of this article, whether violations of the same or different provisions of this article as the initial violation, and whether involving the same or different property, shall increase the fine owing. However, repeated citations for the same violation on a second and subsequent days shall not count as a subsequent violation, but shall rather be assessed at the same rate as the initial violation.

                  Sec. 10-95. - Unified zoning board. 
                  For purposes of this article, the unified zoning board shall serve as the construction board of adjustment and appeals. The unified zoning board shall have the power to hear the appeals of decisions and interpretations of the building official and consider variances of the state minimum standard codes more specifically as listed in sections 10-96 through 10-100. 
                  (Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 1.77)

                  Sec. 10-98. - Variances. 
                  (a)  The unified zoning board, when so appealed to and after a hearing, may vary the application of any provisions of the codes to any particular case when, in its opinion, the enforcement thereof would do manifest injustice and would be contrary to the spirit and purpose of this article or state minimum standard codes or public interest, and also finds all of the following: 
                  (1)  That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the building, structure or service systems involved and which are not applicable to others; 
                  (2)  That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the action or inaction of the applicant; 
                  (3)  That granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this article to other building, structure or service systems; 
                  (4)  That the variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the building, structure or service systems; and 
                  (5)  That the grant of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of this article and will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  Variances cannot be given to totally remove a requirement or to exempt a property or applicant entirely from a requirement. If a variance is being sought that is, in the judgment of the building official, a request that would constitute a text amendment, then the application shall not be accepted. A variance application shall not be accepted if the variance is contradictory to the ordinance (such as reducing a requirement to zero or totally eliminating a requirement). The applicant shall instead be directed to file for a text amendment. Generally, variances can only be given to alter a numeric value, unless otherwise specified. A variance application shall not be accepted if the variance seeks something that cannot be varied.

                  In granting the variance, the board may prescribe a reasonable time limit within which the action for which the variance is required shall be commenced or completed or both. In addition, the board may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this article. Violation of the conditions of a variance shall be deemed a violation of this article.

                  Sec. 10-124. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  When any subdivision or development of land is proposed, and before any permits for development are granted, the developer or his authorized agent shall apply for and secure approval of the proposed subdivision or development in accordance with this article. 
                  (b)  Any subdivision or development of land, including for the purpose of auction, requires approval by the planning department. Prior to subdivision or development of any property and prior to recording the subdivision or development with the county superior court clerk's office, the property owner or his representative shall first receive written approval from the planning department to ensure the proposed subdivision or development meets the standards of this article. 
                  (c)  For the purpose of auction, the planning department shall determine the extent of required compliance with the standards of this article prior to the sale of a subject property. 
                  (d)  All fees for subdivision or development approval shall be established from time to time by resolution of the mayor and city council. 
                  (e)  Where a development is proposed to be developed in phases, the mayor and city council may choose to delay final plat approval of subsequent phases until the development of the initial phases is substantially completed. 
                  (f)  With the exception of recorded final plats, approved plats under this article expire if actual construction has not begun within one year from the approval date, or if actual construction has begun, three years from the approval date. Where a plat has expired, the developer or property owner must seek new approval before continuing with development of the project pursuant to the expired plat. 
                  (g)  Variances. When a variance of any provision of the codes of the city is sought in regards to a property that is the subject of a pending subdivision or development application, and the variance is sought for the purpose of facilitating the subdivision or development, then, notwithstanding any other provision of the code, the unified zoning board shall have the same authority to grant the variance that the unified zoning board would otherwise have. 
                  (h)  Prior to the issuance of any land disturbance permit for a commercial or industrial use, or prior to the approval of any preliminary plat for a subdivision, the property owner/developer shall request a flow test to verify that water lines serving the subject property have sufficient flow to meet the fire protection needs of the intended use or development. 
                  (Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 2.1) 
                  Sec. 10-125. - Subdivision and development plats. 
                  General overview of subdivisions and development plat review and approval procedures. 
                  (1)  Introduction. The procedure for the formal review and approval of a subdivision or development plat consists of the following stages: 
                  a.  Pre-application review; 
                  b.  Preliminary plat acceptance by the unified zoning board; 
                  c.  Construction plan approval by the community development director; 
                  d.  As-built plan approval by the community development director; 
                  e.  Final plat acceptance by the unified zoning board and approval by the mayor and city council; and 
                  f.  Recording and dedication. 
                  (2)  Minor subdivision or development. Minor subdivisions or developments are lot divisions that do not require the installation of streets, utilities, or other public improvements and infrastructure. A proposal to create a minor subdivision or development shall only require review and approval by the community development director before being recorded in the public records of the clerk of the county superior court. The community development director will approve the minor subdivision or development if the submitted plat complies with state law pertaining to the recording of plats and all of the substantive requirements of this article. 
                  (3)  Pre-application review stage. Whenever the subdivision or development of a tract of land is proposed, the subdivider or developer shall consult informally with the community development director prior to filing the application for subdivision or development. The subdivider or developer may submit sketch plans and data showing existing conditions within the site and in its vicinity and the proposed development layout of the subdivision or development. The purpose of the pre-application review stage is to facilitate the subsequent preparation of plans and plats by clarifying matters relating to the proposed subdivision or development. 
                  (4)  Preliminary plat stage. The subdivider must submit to the unified zoning board for approval a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision or development prepared in accordance with the provisions of this article. If the proposed subdivision or development abuts a state highway, a certificate of approval by the state department of transportation must accompany the preliminary plat submission. The county health department must have reviewed the project, and a letter of preliminary approval must be obtained by the subdivider. The subdivider must also furnish copies of such a preliminary plat to all utility companies serving the area. Approval of the unified zoning board will be indicated on the face of the preliminary plat. 
                  (5)  Construction plan stage. Prior to making any street improvements or installing any utilities or other improvements, the subdivider or developer must submit to the community development director construction plans of the proposed subdivision or development, prepared in accordance with the provisions of this article. The design presented in the construction plans must be in conformance with the general design information presented in the preliminary plat that was approved by the unified zoning board. The construction plans must show all street design profiles, topographic information, utility construction plans, sediment and erosion control plans, and other information as may be required by the community development director. The construction plans shall be approved by the community development director upon finding that they are in compliance with all requirements of the city's codes and design specifications. 
                  (6)  As-built plan stage. After making street improvements and utility installation, and before final plat approval, the subdivider shall submit as-built plans that demonstrate that construction has been performed consistently with the approved construction plans and these development regulations. The community development director will review the plans and the work performed to verify compliance prior to allowing final plat to be presented to the unified zoning board. 
                  (7)  Final plat stage. After completion of the physical development, or arrangements for physical development acceptable to the unified zoning board, of all or part of the area shown on the preliminary plat as approved by the unified zoning board, and before selling any lots, a final plat together with the required certificates must be submitted to the unified zoning board and the mayor and city council for approval. The subdivider must also furnish copies of the approved final plat to all utility companies serving the area. 
                  (8)  Recording and dedication. After the final plat is approved by the mayor and city council, the final plat and appropriate documents become the instrument to be recorded in the office of the clerk of the county superior court. After recording, the appropriate deeds and documents must be presented to the appropriate local government agency for dedication and acceptance. 
                  (9)  Redline comments. Whenever a plat is resubmitted after being denied or returned with redline comments, the subdivider or developer shall provide a letter of explanation as to how the comment has been addressed. 
                  (Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 2.2) 
                  Sec. 10-126. - Procedures for subdivision or development preliminary plat. 
                  (a)  Submission and approval of preliminary plat. 
                  (1)  Preliminary plat submission. After completing the preliminary review stage, and at the regular time specified by the community development department before the regularly scheduled monthly meeting of the unified zoning board at which the subdivider desires unified zoning board action, the subdivider must submit the following: 
                  a.  A letter requesting review and approval of a preliminary plat and giving the name and address of a person to whom the notice of hearing and action on the preliminary plat is to be sent; 
                  b.  Two 24-inch by 36-inch copies and eight 11-inch by 17-inch copies of the preliminary plat and supporting data. At this time, the community development director may direct the subdivider to furnish additional copies to the review agencies having appropriate technical expertise or proper authority for review and comment. Electronic copies in .pdf format specified by the community development director shall be required; 
                  c.  If the subdivision or development is not to be served by public water and sewage systems, a certificate from the county health department approving the proposed water supply and sewage disposal systems; and 
                  d.  If the proposed subdivision or development abuts a state highway, a certificate of approval or comparable permission of access for the proposed subdivision or development by the state department of transportation. 
                  (2)  Additional information. The unified zoning board may ask for any additional information it feels is needed to evaluate the preliminary plat. 
                  (3)  Official date of submission. The official date of submission of the preliminary plat will be the date of the next regularly scheduled monthly meeting of the unified zoning board. 
                  (4)  Preliminary plat review. The community development director, or designee, will review the preliminary plat for the unified zoning board for conformance to this article and other relevant regulations. The unified zoning board will consider the comments or suggestions of the appropriate review agencies requested to review the preliminary plat. The community development director, or designee, will indicate on the preliminary plat (or by a written memorandum attached to the preliminary plat) for the unified zoning board any comments or suggested changes that are necessary to meet the intent of this article or to serve the best interests of the city. 
                  (5)  Public hearing. Before acting on the preliminary plat, the unified zoning board will schedule a public hearing on the preliminary plat. Notice of the hearing must be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the city at least 15 days before the hearing. 
                  (6)  Action of the unified zoning board. No more than 45 days after the official date of submission of the preliminary plat, the unified zoning board will either approve the plat, conditionally approve the plat (noting the conditions of approval on the plat), or not approve the plat. Action may be taken on the entire preliminary plat or any portion of it. 
                  (7)  Failure of unified zoning board to act. If the unified zoning board fails to act within 45 days of the official date of submission of the preliminary plat, the preliminary plat will be deemed to be automatically approved by the unified zoning board. 
                  (8)  Expiration of preliminary plat. Whenever the developer or owner of an approved preliminary plat has not broken ground on the development within one year of the plat's approval, or has not completed development within three years of the plat's approval, the plat shall be deemed abandoned regardless of any intent of the developer or property owner not to abandon and shall require resubmittal and approval subject to the terms of these development regulations and applicable ordinances before any further land disturbing activities may take place or any further permits or approvals may be issued. Prior to the expiration of these time periods, the developer or property owner may apply to the unified zoning board for an extension of time, which may be granted for a certain period of time based on a showing of good cause. 
                  (b)  Specifications for preliminary plat. The preliminary plat must meet the minimum standards of design set forth in this article and must include the following: 
                  (1)  Generally.

                  The following regulations apply to properties in all zoning districts, unless the regulations of a particular zoning district expressly provide otherwise: 
                  (1)  Sight distance. In order to ensure maintenance of adequate sight distances at intersections, no fence, wall, shrubbery, or other obstruction to vision between the heights of three feet and 15 feet above the ground is permitted within 20 feet of the intersection of the rights-of-way of streets or of streets and railroads. 
                  (2)  Applicability to land, buildings, and open space. No building, structure, land, or open space may be used or occupied and no building or structure or part of a building or structure may be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered unless in conformity with all of the regulations specified for the district in which it is located. 
                  (3)  Every use must be on a lot. No building or structure may be erected or use established unless upon a lot. 
                  (4)  Only one principal building per lot. Only one principal building and its accessory buildings may be erected on any lot, except for planned developments or as otherwise provided. 
                  (5)  Streetlights. Developers of new multifamily, commercial or industrial developments shall install streetlights along the public road frontage consistent with the specifications for streetlights in this article. 
                  (6)  Open space not to be encroached upon. No open space may be encroached upon or reduced in any manner except in conformity with the setback, off-street parking spaces, and other such required development standards contained in this article. Shrubbery, driveways, retaining walls, fences, curbs, and buffers are not considered to be encroachments of setbacks. Open space areas as required by this article must be permanently maintained as open space in accordance with the requirements of this article. 
                  (7)  Reduction of setbacks or lot area. Except as otherwise provided in this article, a lot existing at the time of passage of this article may not be reduced, divided, or changed as to produce a tract of land which does not comply with the minimum dimension or area requirements of this article for the district in which it is located unless that reduction or division is necessary to provide land which is needed and accepted for public use. 
                  (8)  Lots with multiple frontage. In the case of a corner lot or double frontage lot, front setback requirements apply to all lot lines abutting a street. 
                  (9)  Landlocked lots. In the case of a landlocked lot (a lot without direct access to a public street or road) lawfully existing as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, the property owner is entitled to one building permit, as long as all of the following requirements are met: 
                  a.  No other principal building exists or is being constructed on the property. 
                  b.  No other valid building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this article and is currently valid.

                  (11)  Substandard lots. Any lot existing at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived which has an area or a width which is less than required by this article is subject to the following exceptions and modifications: 
                  a.  Adjoining lots in same ownership. When two or more adjoining and vacant lots are within a non-approved development with continuous frontage and are in single ownership at the time of application and such lots have a frontage or lot area less than is required by the district in which they are located, such lots must be replatted so as to create one or more lots which conform to the minimum frontage and area requirements of the district. 
                  b.  Single lots. When a lot has an area or frontage which does not conform with the requirements of the district in which it is located, but was a lot at the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, such a lot may be used for any use allowed in the zoning district in which it is located as long as all other requirements of this article are met. 
                  (12)  Encroachment on public rights-of-way. No building, structure, service area, required off-street parking, or loading/unloading facility is permitted to encroach on public rights-of-way.

                  (16)  State waters. If a lot is bounded by or contains drainage or natural surface water features, the developer shall provide an environmental assessment from a licensed and qualified environmental engineer to determine whether the waters are State waters and the bounds thereof, and whether buffers are required. The method used to determine that buffers are necessary based on information defined by the EPD publication, "The Field Guide for Determining the Presence of State Waters that Require a Buffer" (including the presence of base flow) should be provided in the assessment. The environmental assessment should include photographs of the site and water feature and a plat or survey identifying the location of the water feature on or adjacent to the property. 
                  (17)  Multifamily developments. Whenever a lot is planned to be developed as a multifamily residential development under common ownership or without subdivision, it shall be subject to the same procedures for review of a preliminary plat, construction plat and as-built plat as a multifamily subdivision, including review by the unified zoning board, to ensure compliance with the purposes and intent of these development regulations and the zoning ordinance. 
                  (Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 3.1) 
                  Sec. 10-155. - Development standards for subdivisions. 
                  All subdivisions established in the city must comply with the development standards contained in this article. However, where provisions of the zoning ordinance apply and are stricter, those provisions take precedence. Development standards for subdivisions are as follows: 
                  (1)  Lot lines. As far as practical, side lot lines must be perpendicular or radial to street lines. 
                  (2)  Jurisdictional limits and lot lines. Subdivision lots must not be divided by city or county boundary lines. 
                  (3)  Lot frontage arrangements. Land must be subdivided in a manner that provides each lot in the subdivision with direct abutting access to an existing public street or to an approved private street contained within the proposed subdivision. The minimum amount of lot frontage required in each zoning district is shown in the city's zoning ordinance. 
                  (4)  Adequate building sites. Each subdivision lot must contain an adequate building site not subject to flooding and outside the limits of existing easements or building setback lines required by this article or any existing ordinance as is appropriate. 
                  (5)  Double or reverse frontage lots. Double and reverse frontage lots, unless required by the unified zoning board, are prohibited except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of slope, orientation, or property size. A reserve strip planted with a vegetative screen across which there is no right of access may be required along the line of lots abutting a traffic artery or other such incompatible use. 
                  (6)  Commercial and industrial lots. Size, shape, and arrangement of commercial and industrial lots, where platted and classified as a subdivision, are subject to the approval of the unified zoning board. 
                  (7)  Lot remnants. Lot remnants are prohibited. Such remnant areas must be added to adjacent lots, rather than remain as unusable parcels. 
                  (8)  Monuments. Solid steel rods at least one-half inch in diameter or square and two feet long must be set at all street corners, at all points where street lines intersect the exterior boundaries of the subdivision, at angle points in streets, at points of curve in streets, and at points of change of direction in the exterior boundaries of the subdivision. The top of the monument must have an indented cross to identify the finished grade. All other lot corners must be marked with solid steel rods no less than one-half inch in diameter, and at least two feet long, driven so as to be flush with the finished grade. 
                  (9)  State waters. If a subdivision is bounded by or contains drainage or natural surface water features, the subdivider shall provide for review and approval by the community development director an environmental assessment from a licensed and qualified environmental engineer to determine whether the waters are State waters and the bounds thereof, and whether buffers are required. The method used to determine that buffers are necessary based on information defined by the EPD publication, "The Field Guide for Determining the Presence of State Waters that Require a Buffer" (including the presence of base flow) should be provided in the assessment. The environmental assessment should include photographs of the site and water feature and a plat or survey identifying the location of the water feature on or adjacent to the property.

                  6.  In areas where layers of organic or other unstable materials exist, the existing ground shall be excavated, for the full width of the fill area, to an underlying stable material. The subgrade thus created shall then be compacted to the approximate density of the underlying material. 
                  7.  All fill material shall be deposited and spread in uniform horizontal layers, not more than six inches thick, for the full width of the fill area, and these layers shall be kept uniform by the use of graders, bulldozers or other approved equipment. 
                  8.  Each layer shall be compacted within the range of optimum moisture content necessary to achieve the compaction required. Material containing too much water shall be dried to the correct moisture content. If the material is too dry, water shall be added and uniformly mixed with the soil before it is compacted. 
                  9.  Fills shall be compacted to at least 95 percent of the maximum dry density to within the top 12 inches of the fill. The top 12 inches of the fill shall be compacted to at least 100 percent of the maximum dry density. 
                  10.  The entire roadbed shall be scarified and compacted with a sheep's foot or other approved rollers. 
                  11.  While the work is in progress, contractor shall maintain the surface in a manner so that the excavation, fills, subgrade, base course, and ditches always present a smooth and even surface. 
                  12.  The contractor shall have available on the job at all times at least one motor patrol grader with adequate power to blade and maintain the roadbed. Suitable scarifiers shall also be available for use whenever necessary. 
                  e.  Final finishing of roadway. 
                  1.  After all excavation has been completed and all fills have been placed, the entire road bed surface shall be finally shaped with a grading machine, supplemented with hand work whenever required, to secure a smooth surface and uniform cross section. 
                  2.  Slopes of cuts and fills shall also be carefully shaped to the true section specified. 
                  3.  When final shaping is finished, the road surface shall conform accurately to the line, grade and cross section shown on plans, and no roots, sod, grass, stones, or other unsuitable material shall remain in the top 12 inches of the finished roadbed. 
                  4.  All ditches and drains shall be opened to effectively drain the roadway. 
                  (2)  Placement of curb and gutter. 
                  a.  After sanitary sewer lines have been installed, all storm drainage in place, and the final finishing of the roadway has been approved by the community development director, and the centerline profile has been approved, the installation of the concrete curb and gutter may begin. 
                  b.  Any curb and gutter which does not conform to a true section, texture, line, and grade shall be removed and replaced as directed by the community development director. 
                  c.  Water lines shall be installed after installation of the curb and gutter. 
                  (3)  Subgrade. 
                  a.  Before placing any pavement base, the entire surface of the subgrade shall be plowed, harrowed, and mixed to a depth of at least six inches. If a subgrade stabilization material is required, it shall be incorporated into the subgrade at this time. 
                  b.  After the material has been thoroughly mixed, the subgrade shall be brought into a proper line and grade and compacted to 100 percent of maximum dry density just prior to placing the base material. 
                  c.  The centerline profile shall conform to the established elevations with an acceptable tolerance of one-half inch. 
                  d.  The acceptance crown tolerance shall be one-half inch.

                  a.  The community development director shall be notified 24 hours prior to the placing of any base material. 
                  b.  The community development director may authorize the placing of the base material after all equipment necessary for the proper construction of the road base is on the project and the subgrade has been brought to the proper line, grade and crown, and compacted to the required density. 
                  c.  The community development director shall check the completed base course after the base material has been placed and compacted to the required density. All areas found to be deficient shall be marked and corrected before any asphalt pavement is placed. Areas where the crown is found to exceed that which is specified, or the exposed edge of the concrete gutter is less than the minimum depth required, shall be reshaped and rolled to obtain the required cross section. 
                  d.  After the compacted material has been approved, field tests shall be taken by the field contractor and development inspector, or by a professional engineer as directed by the community development director or designee to determine the thickness of the constructed base course. Tests shall be taken at 1,000 feet intervals alternating between each lane and center of roadway. Measurements shall be taken per GDOT-21, GDOT-42 or GDOT-59 methods of test for measurement of thickness of bases and subbases. Areas found to be deficient in thickness shall be corrected as directed by the community development director. No asphalt course shall be placed until deficiencies in base have been adequately addressed. 
                  e.  A copy of all delivery tickets for the graded aggregate base material shall be furnished prior to placing any asphaltic concrete paving material. A shortage in the base material used shall require that the asphaltic concrete surface course thickness be increased. 
                  f.  All work and materials shall be in accordance with the pertinent graded aggregate construction sections of the state department of transportation "Standard Specifications," latest edition. 
                  (5)  Soil cement. A soil cement base may be used to improve the subgrade with approval by the city but shall not be used as a substitute for base construction. Soil testing and mix design must be performed by the developer and approved by the community development director. 
                  (6)  Paving. 
                  a.  The contractor shall begin the construction of the asphaltic concrete pavement upon approval of the road base by the community development director. 
                  b.  All asphaltic concrete material and construction shall be in accordance with the "hot mix asphaltic concrete construction" sections of the state department of transportation "Standard Specifications," latest edition. 
                  c.  The community development director or designee shall check the cross section of the finished pavement. Any area found to be deficient shall be marked and a record of deficiencies made by the community development director. 
                  d.  If, in the opinion of the community development director or designee, the extent of deficiencies will impair the performance of the pavement, he shall direct that an overlay of a minimum thickness of one inch be placed before the roadway is opened to traffic. 
                  e.  A copy of the delivery tickets for the asphaltic concrete material used shall be furnished to the community development director at the time of completion of the work. If the delivery tickets indicate a shortage in the material used from the quantity estimated, the community development director may require a minimum one inch overlay of the streets. 
                  f.  The GAB (base) thickness is to be measured and accepted by the city prior to placement of any asphalt course. The applicant shall have core tests made to verify the thickness and compaction of the asphalt pavement course. The minimum core diameter shall be such that compaction of the sample can be determined in the lab and subsequent data supplied to the community development director. The compaction of the course shall be required to meet state department of transportation specifications per the asphalt mix placed. If a two-course asphalt section is required, the cores for the binder layer shall be cut, reviewed, and approved by the community development director prior to placement of the topping lift. Also, in the event that a two course asphalt section is required, the cores for the topping lift, if between 1½ inch and 1¼ inch in thickness, shall be made to determine the thickness only. All cores shall be made on 1,000 feet intervals, alternating between each lane and center of roadway. If these cores indicate a deficiency in thickness or compaction of the asphalt pavement, an overlay shall be required when the following deficiencies occur: 
                  1.  When the number of cores deficient in thickness within the allowable one-quarter of an inch tolerance, or deficient in compaction, exceeds 35 percent of the total cores taken on one street. 
                  2.  When two or more consecutive tests show a deficiency of more than one-quarter of an inch allowable tolerance or a deficiency in compaction. When a core shows a deficiency in excess of the allowable tolerance or compaction, additional cores shall be taken to delineate the area of the deficient thickness/compaction. 
                  g.  The applicant shall correct any deficiency with an overlay extending a minimum of 150 feet beyond the outer limits of the deficient area for the full width of the street. Smooth, neat joints shall be saw cut normal to the roadway for full depth of asphalt pavement, removing the original pavement for a minimum of ten feet at each end of the overlay. The thickness of the overlay shall be determined by the depth of the deficient area and shall not be less than 1¼ inch in compacted thickness. The type of material used in the overlay shall be specified by the community development director. 
                  (7)  Shoulder and drainage improvements. After the paving has been inspected and approved, the pavement edges or behind the curb and gutter shall be backfilled and compacted and the ditches and back slopes properly graded, shaped, seeded and mulched. An 80 percent stand of grass shall be obtained. All swales and ditches excavated below required depth shall be backfilled and compacted to 95 percent of maximum dry density. 
                  (8)  Compliance with minimum standards.

                  Sec. 10-171. - Illicit discharge and illegal connection. 
                  (a)  Description. An illicit discharge is defined as any discharge to a municipal or county separate storm sewer system (stormwater drainage system) that is not composed entirely of stormwater runoff (except for discharges allowed under an NPDES permit or non-polluting flows). These non-stormwater discharges occur due to illegal dumping or illegal connections to the stormwater drainage system. 
                  (b)  Introduction. It is hereby determined that: 
                  (1)  Discharges to the city's separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
                  (2)  These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the city's separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments; 
                  (3)  These non-stormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters; 
                  (4)  The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
                  (5)  These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the city's separate storm sewer system. 
                  It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the city's separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment. 
                  (c)  General provisions.

                  DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

                  Sec. 10-199. - Introduction. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation, which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  Flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas. 
                  (c)  Effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can: 
                  (1)  Protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  Minimize damage to private property; 
                  (3)  Minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in floodplains; and 
                  (4)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public. 
                  (d)  Article IX, section II of the constitution of the state and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city does ordain this article and establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction policies for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property. 
                  (Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 4.2) 
                  Sec. 10-200. - Description. 
                  (a)  Floodplain management involves the designation of flood-prone areas and the managing of their uses. It is also aimed at minimizing modifications to streams, reducing flood hazards, and protecting the beneficial uses of the floodplain such as water quality protection. As such, floodplain management can be seen as a subset of the larger consideration of surface water and stormwater management. Floodplain regulations and development restrictions can greatly reduce future flooding impacts, preserve greenspace and habitat, and protect their function in safely conveying floodwaters and protecting water quality. This article aims to help the city integrate floodplain management with stormwater management during the land development process. 
                  (b)  This article requires that the city regulate the floodplains that will be expected with future land-use conditions, which are based upon the communities' adopted future land use map, zoning, or watershed study projections. The article also requires the city to regulate floodplains on all streams with a drainage area of 100 acres and greater. 
                  (c)  In order to administer this article, "future-conditions" floodplains must be established as follows: 
                  (1)  Future-conditions floodplains for streams with a drainage area of one square mile (640 acres) and greater in size are to be delineated by the local jurisdiction. As required in the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District, district-wide watershed management plan, cities and counties are expected to model and map at least ten percent of their area each year until future-conditions floodplains have been established for the entire community. 
                  (2)  For streams with a drainage area between 100 acres and 640 acres, the local jurisdiction shall model and map the future-conditions floodplains or require the future-conditions floodplains be determined on a per development basis by the applicant. 
                  (3)  For development projects in watersheds of any size where future-conditions floodplains have not yet been established, the applicant will be required to determine the future-conditions floodplain boundaries located on their property in accordance with approved methodologies and in compliance with this article.

                  Sec. 10-219. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, streambank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development that may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; and, 
                  (6)  Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas.

                  Start of construction means the date the permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. The term "permanent construction" does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

                  Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a building taking place during a ten-year period in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The term "market value of the building" means: 
                  (1)  The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or 
                  (2)  In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. 
                  The term "substantial improvement" includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage" regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the building official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certificates, or other evidence of compliance required in this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  Sec. 10-316. - General standards. 
                  (a)  No development shall be allowed within the future-conditions floodplain that could result in any of the following: 
                  (1)  Raising the base flood elevation or future-conditions flood elevation equal to or more than 0.01 foot; 
                  (2)  Reducing the base flood or future-conditions flood storage capacity; 
                  (3)  Changing the flow characteristics as to the depth and velocity of the waters of the base flood or future-conditions flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the development area; or 
                  (4)  Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation. 
                  (b)  Any development within the future-conditions floodplain allowed under subsection (a) of this section shall also meet the following conditions: 
                  (1)  Compensation for storage capacity shall occur between the average groundwater table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and between the average groundwater table elevation and the future-condition flood elevation for the future-conditions flood, and lie either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed and shall be within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain storage. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the top of the natural (predevelopment) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel; 
                  (2)  Cut areas shall be stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than 2.0 percent; 
                  (3)  Effective transitions shall be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased; 
                  (4)  Verification of no-rise conditions (0.01 foot or less), flood storage volumes, and flow characteristics shall be provided via a step-backwater analysis meeting the requirements of section 10-317; 
                  (5)  Public utilities and facilities, such as water, sanitary sewer, gas, and electrical systems, shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration or contamination from floodwaters; and 
                  (6)  Any significant physical changes to the base flood floodplain shall be submitted as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. The CLOMR submittal shall be subject to approval by the community development director using the community consent forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for final approval. The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval shall be the responsibility of the applicant.

                  Sec. 10-317. - Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachments. 
                  (a)  An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways for which the provisions of section 10-340 apply. This study shall be prepared by a currently registered professional engineer in the state and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the community development department prior to the approval of any permit that would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include: 
                  (1)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development; 
                  (2)  Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the community development department. Cross sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles and future-conditions flood profiles; 
                  (3)  Floodplain storage calculations based on cross sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development; and 
                  (4)  A preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all future-conditions floodplain encroachments. 
                  (b)  Detailed flood studies in areas where floodplain has been established but the base flood elevation (BFE) and/or the floodway has not been established and in areas beyond the limits of study on the FIRM, which may contain a watercourse and have greater than 100 acres of surface drainage area above the property, shall be submitted showing the base flood elevations, future-conditions flood elevations, and the floodway. Approval of the study must be received before the final plat of the affected lots can be approved or a certificate of occupancy can be issued.

                  Sec. 10-318. - Floodway encroachments. 
                  Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in subsection (2) of this section. 
                  (2)  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  (3)  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the community development department until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by the community development director.

                  (4)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (5)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (6)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (7)  In reviewing such requests, the community development department and unified zoning board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (8)  Conditions for variances. 
                  a.  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  1.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  3.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance. 
                  b.  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  c.  Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  d.  The community development director shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (9)  Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the community development department and unified zoning board shall deem necessary to the consideration of the request. 
                  (10)  Upon consideration of the factors listed in this section and the purposes of this article, the community development department and the unified zoning board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as they deem necessary or appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this article. 
                  (11)  Variances shall not be issued after the fact.

The following actions may be taken after a notice of violation has been issued, or may be taken without a notice of violation first being issued, as is appropriate in the judgment of the officials of the community development department to achieve the purposes of this article and protect the public health, safety and welfare. 
                  (1)  Stop-work order. The community development department may issue a stop-work order which shall be served on the applicant or other responsible person. A stop-work order may be issued after a notice of violation or may be issued in conjunction with a notice of violation. The stop-work order shall remain in effect until the applicant or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth indicated in the order or notice of violation or has otherwise cured the violation or violations described therein. 
                  a.  Stop-work orders shall affect all work being done on a project or development (including work done on other lots in the subdivision owned by the same violator). Stop-work orders stop not only the work in violation, but all other work by contractors or sub-contractors on the same property. Only work to remedy the deficiency shall be allowed until the stop-work order is lifted. 
                  b.  A stop-work order shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner of the property, his authorized agent or the person in charge of the activity on the property, and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed. Where an emergency or other exigent circumstances exist, no written notice shall be required, and a verbal stop-work order may be issued, with a written order to be provided within three working days. 
                  c.  Stop-work orders may be issued on their own or in conjunction with criminal citations or civil proceedings in superior court.

                  (3)  Suspension, revocation or modification of permit. The community development department may suspend, revoke or modify the permit authorizing the land development project. A suspended, revoked or modified permit may be reinstated after the applicant or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured the violations described therein, provided such permit may be reinstated (upon such conditions as the department may deem necessary) to enable the applicant or other responsible person to take the necessary remedial measures to cure such violations. 
                  (4)  Civil penalties. In the event the applicant or other responsible person fails to take the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or otherwise fails to cure the violations described therein within ten days, or such shorter or longer period as the community development department shall deem appropriate depending on the severity of the situation (at a minimum 24 hours unless the situation is a severe emergency), the community development department may impose a penalty not to exceed $1,000.00 (depending on the severity of the violation) for each day the violation remains unremedied after receipt of the notice of violation. If unpaid, the city may seek enforcement of such penalties in superior or municipal court. Civil fines may also be sought in actions filed in superior court for injunctive relief, whether or not a notice of violation was issued. 
                  (5)  Criminal penalties. In addition to, or in lieu of, any of the actions in subsections (a)(1) through (4) of this section, the community development department may issue a citation to the applicant or other responsible person, requiring such person to appear in municipal or superior court to answer charges for such violation. Upon conviction, such person shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 or imprisonment for 60 days or both. Each act of violation and each day upon which any violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The minimum fine for a violation of this article shall be $500.00. Such fines may be sought in connection with an action for injunctive relief in superior court. All persons involved in the violation, including land owners, developers, responsible parties, and persons actually conducting the activity, may be cited with violations of this article. Citations may be issued in conjunction with notices of violation and/or stop-work orders, but a notice of violation need not be issued prior to issuance of a citation. 
                  (6)  Emergency enforcement. In the event an emergency is of such immediacy and danger that giving a 24-hours' notice of violation would threaten the public health, safety and welfare, the city is authorized to enter upon the subject private property, without giving prior notice, to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and correct the situation. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner, agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the government agency or designated contractor to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth above. The city shall be authorized to recover costs of the abatement from the property owner or responsible parties. 
                  (7)  Remedies not exclusive. The remedies listed in this section are not exclusive of any other remedies available under any applicable federal, state or local law, and the city may seek cumulative remedies. 
                  (b)  In any action brought in municipal or superior court to enforce this article, the city shall be entitled to recover attorney's fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement of this article, including sampling and monitoring expenses.

                  Sec. 10-427. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/ BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(2) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15), (16) and (17) of this section, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c).

The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" published by the state soil and water conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;

                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq., except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (17)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-280 et seq., and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade stormwater detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this subsection the term "maintenance" shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. The term "maintenance" includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. The term "maintenance" does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat. 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented.

                  (d)  Adoption of additional requirements. Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  Injury to property not evidence of violation. The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. of 8-11-2016, § 5.3) 
                  Sec. 10-428. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  Generally. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the city to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the city and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 10-427(b) and (c) will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by five hard copies and one digital copy of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with Ga. Comp. R. and Regs. 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(5)(a), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 10-427(c)(15) through (17) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6) of this section have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 10-427(b) and (c) or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" is hereby incorporated by reference into this article.

The complaint may be filed and prosecuted by the city attorney or city solicitor. The complaint may be filed in the municipal court, pursuant to that court's jurisdiction under O.C.G.A. § 41-2-5, or in the superior court of the county in which the property where the violation is alleged to exist lies. A summons and the complaint shall be served on all interested parties in such dwelling, building, or structure.

The interested parties shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for the hearing. 
                  (e)  If, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions; or otherwise constitutes a public nuisance, then the court shall state in writing its findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order stating: 
                  (1)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the dwelling, building, structure, or property can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, structure, or property, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, structure, or property so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  (2)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property. For purposes of this provision, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction. In any action brought to enforce the provisions of this chapter, the city shall be entitled to its reasonable attorney's fees and other litigation costs, such to be a lien against the property, unless the court determines that the failure to comply with this chapter was substantially justified based on the record as a whole. 
                  (f)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the code compliance officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved or to be vacated and closed, or demolished.

                  Sec. 10-520. - Findings and intent. 
                  (a)  The city council finds that there is a need to establish a foreclosure and vacant real property as a mechanism to protect property values in neighborhoods for all property owners. 
                  (b)  Due to the lack of adequate maintenance and security of properties that are foreclosed or where ownership has been transferred after foreclosure, the property values and quality of life of neighboring properties are negatively impacted. 
                  (c)  Improperly maintained and secured foreclosed properties can become a hazard to the health and safety of persons who may come on or near the property and can adversely affect the aesthetic and economic attributes of communities. Difficulties also often arise in locating the person responsible for the condition of foreclosed real property. The governing authority finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the provisions in this article. 
                  (d)  This foreclosure and vacant real property registry will require owners and agents to provide the city with official information for contacting a party responsible for bringing foreclosed and vacant real property into compliance with applicable provisions of this Code.

                  6.  Whether reasonable measures can be taken to save the building, structure, site, tree, or object from collapse; and

                  (1)  In the event the commission rejects an application, it shall state its reasons for doing so, and shall transmit a record of such actions and reasons, in writing, to the applicant.

                  (n)  Appeals. Any person adversely affected by any determination made by the commission relative to the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness my appeal such determination to the city council.

                  Sec. 39-27. - Standard for installation and operation. 
                  In order to ensure adequate illumination of public rights-of-way and promote safety and security it is ordained that the American National Standard Practice for Roadway Lighting of the Illuminating Engineering Society, as approved by the American National Standard Institute (1977), as amended, is adopted as the standard for installation and operation of lighting in the city with the following exception: 
                  (1)  Lighting fixtures installed within the public right-of-way to be operated for the purpose of street illumination shall comply with these standards. The minimum average horizontal footcandle illumination level by roadway classification shall be: 

                   
                  The uniformity of illumination shall be such that the point of lowest illumination shall have at least one-third of the average horizontal footcandle streets; it may be not less than one-sixth of this average. 
                  (2)  Any party requesting permission to install or operate lighting fixtures within public right-of-way shall furnish plans specifications to the community development director for approval. Should the community development director disapprove a request to install or operate lighting fixtures within any public right-of-way, he shall communicate disapproval in writing to the party requesting approval. The written communication shall include specific reasons for disapproval. Any disapproval of a light or lighting system by the community development director may be appealed to the city council. If any party desires to appeal an adverse decision by the community development director within 30 days from the date following the written notice of disapproval, it shall be the responsibility of the community development director to transmit, forthwith, to the city council all papers and allied documents constituting the record upon which the action appealed was taken and to ensure that the appeal is promptly placed upon the agenda of the city council for its determination. The city council may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from. 
                  (3)  Roadway or street lighting luminaries or fixtures installed within the public right-of-way as "security lights" for the purpose of lighting areas other than the public streets, shall be mounted on the side of the pole opposite from the street and shall be oriented in such a manner to ensure that the lateral light distribution pattern is parallel to the street and the vertical light distribution, at the initial light source, is perpendicular to the street, so as to protect the users of the street from objectionable glare. The approval of the community development director shall be obtained before installation of these lights. 
                  (4)  Other lighting fixtures to be installed within or outside of public right-of-way for whatever purpose shall be installed and operated in such a manner to prevent glare from being a hazard to or interfering with the normal use of the public right-of-way.

The petition shall be advertised in the official organ of the city one time at least ten days before the public hearing. Safety and economic factors shall be the prime consideration in making such a determination. A petition may be brought by less than ten property owners where such petitioners represent 100 percent of the property owners within the district to be established. The owner, developer, or other person developing a subdivision shall be required to provide street lights which conform to all of the standards provided for in this article.

                  (9)  Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment processes employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the wastewater treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters. 
                  (10)  Any water or wastes which, by interaction with other water or wastes in the public sewer system, release toxic or inhibitory compounds. 
                  (m)  All persons discharging non-domestic wastewater into the public sewers shall be charged and assessed a surcharge, in addition to any sewer service charges, if these wastes have a concentration greater than the following normal concentrations: 
                  A five-day, 20-degree Celsius biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of 250 mg/l, or, suspended solids content of 250 mg/l, as determined by laboratory analysis in accordance with Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater. (Except for certain low flow, non-domestic dischargers. See subsection (t) of this section.) 
                  (n)  Surcharges imposed for certain non-domestic wastewater. Non-domestic wastewater dischargers may be imposed surcharges, at the sole discretion of the city, for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and/or total suspended solids (TSS) that exceeds 250 mg/l. The amount of such surcharge, which is hereby charged and assessed against all persons discharging non-domestic wastewater into the public sewers, shall reflect the cost incurred by the city in handling the excess BOD and TSS. This surcharge shall include a proportionate share of the following: 
                  (1)  Fixed charges for maintenance and operation of the sewerage system to include sewer, plants, pumping stations and other necessary appurtenances including depreciation and other incidental expense. 
                  (2)  Formula determining surcharge. When either or both the total suspended solids and BOD of water or waste accepted for admission to the city sewerage works exceeds the values of these constituents for normal sewage, the excess concentration in either or both, as the case may be, shall be evaluated in terms of normal sewerage and be subject to a surcharge on the amount derived in accordance with the following formula: 
                  Amount of surcharge = (A-B) x Q x 8.34 x C x D 
                  Where: "A" = The actual BOD or TSS (average for month) mg/l. 
                  Where: "B" = 250 mg/l. 
                  Where: "C" = The cost per pound of BOD or TSS above the established maximum of 250 mg/l. 
                  Where: "D" = The days of the month. 
                  Where: "Q" = The average daily flow MGD. 
                  (o)  The rates of surcharge for each of the aforementioned constituents at present shall be as follows: 
                  (1)  For biochemical oxygen demand (BOD): $0.50/lb.; 
                  (2)  For total suspended solids: $0.50/lb. 
                  (p)  For those situations in which BOD or TSS are in excess of 350 mg/l, a surcharge will not be levied, and the BOD and TSS levels exceeding 350 mg/l will be a violation which will be punished as a misdemeanor, and violators will be charged up to a maximum $1,000.00 per violation. 
                  (q)  The rates of surcharge shall be reviewed annually by the city, at the sole discretion of the city, in order that the above factors may correctly represent current treatment costs. If changes are deemed advisable, they may be made effective January 1 of each year, when approved by the mayor and city council. 
                  (r)  Surcharges will be based on composite wastewater samples collected by the city from time-to-time taken of the non-domestic user's wastewater discharge. The surcharge for a particular sample that exceeds 250 mg/l will remain in effect for the entire subsequent month following the month in which the sample was taken. If the city collects multiple samples in a given month, then the sample results for that month will be averaged for the surcharge applicability and/or amount. The calculated surcharge amount will be added to the non-domestic user's water and sewer bill for the applicable months. For any months for which no samples are collected, the most immediate past sample or samples will remain in effect. 
                  (s)  Any sample collected by the city, or reported by the non-domestic user, that exceeds 350 mg/l of BOD or TSS will be considered to be a violation of this article and subject to a fine of $1,000.00 per violation. The non-domestic user will be notified of all such violations by a written notice of violation (NOV). The $1,000.00 fine will be imposed on the non-domestic user's subsequent water and sewer bill following the issuance of the NOV. Any non-domestic user who receives three or more NOVs in a given month will be subject to the termination of sewer service. 
                  (t)  Mass limits. It is acknowledged by the city that non-domestic wastewater dischargers whose flows are low will not adversely impact the city's sewer system. In that regard, there will be no BOD or TSS violations imposed for non-domestic users whose flows are less than 25,000 gpd, and whose mass loadings for BOD and TSS are less than 73 pounds per day.

                  Sec. 47-90. - Operation of business from residential district prohibited. 
                  Unless specifically permitted as a use under the applicable provision of article V of this chapter, no business or commercial enterprise may operate in a residentially-zoned district. Operation of a business or commercial enterprise shall include, but not be limited to, such activities as: having employees report to work at the property; storing commercial vehicles at the property; parking commercial vehicles at the property (other than as specifically permitted by section 47-96); conducting any manufacturing or assembly at the property; retail or wholesale sales of any sort; providing any service, maintenance or repair at the property (other than permitted home occupations); and storage of any materials, supplies, products, or components at the property. Home offices and home occupations are permitted as shown in sections 47-91 and 47-92.

                  Sec. 47-91. - Home offices. 
                  Home offices are permitted in any home, allowing the occupant to work from home or to manage a business licensed as a mobile business. No customers, suppliers or vendors shall be permitted at a home office. Employees are not permitted to report to work, receive assignments, or pick up vehicles at a home office. No non-resident of the home may work in the home office (i.e., no outside employees may work in the office). See also section 47-90. Home occupations are permitted as stated in section 47-92.

                  Home occupations are permitted in zoning districts as listed in article V of this chapter. No home occupation shall occupy more than 30 percent of the heated floor space of the principal use building. No separate building or structure may be constructed to house a home occupation. A home occupation must be a use that is clearly incidental and secondary to the use of the dwelling as a residence and that does not change the character thereof or reveal from the exterior that the dwelling is being used in part for other than a residence. No non-resident of the home may work in the home occupation (i.e., no non-resident employees). There shall be no display, stock in trade, or commodity sold on the premises, and no mechanical equipment used except such as is commonly used for purely domestic household purposes. Such permissible occupations include, in general, such personal services such as are furnished by a musician, artist, seamstress, cook, or laundress, consultant, telecommuter, or other occupation which does not generate nonresidential traffic nor has non-occupant employees, but shall not include such uses as barbershops, beauty parlors, tea rooms, animal hospitals, animal grooming, or a wholesale, retail or manufacturing business.

Recreational vehicles on residential property shall only be parked in the side or rear yard, within setbacks, although the community development director may administratively vary this requirement if there is not sufficient room in or access to the rear or side yards. No more than two recreational vehicles shall be parked on any single residential lot.

                  (a)  No more than two commercial vehicles (trailers counted separately if separated from a tractor) shall be parked on any single residential lot, or on any lot in any residentially-zoned lot. Commercial vehicles may not be parked on any residential lot without an occupied single-family dwelling, and may not be parked on vacant residential lots. 
                  (b)  Commercial vehicles parked in any residential zone or residentially-used area shall not be permitted to be parked in any required setback or buffer area.

The community development director shall be permitted to grant a hardship administrative variance to allow parking in a setback or front yard if no other room exists. 
                  (c)  The community development director shall be permitted to grant a hardship administrative variance to allow up to four commercial vehicles to park on one lot (for example, if four family members living there each drive a commercial vehicle home from work), but in no circumstance shall such variance be used to permit employees to report to a residential structure on a daily basis to pick up commercial vehicles for the company's operation.

                  (i)  Compliance. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the PUD shall comply with all the requirements of this chapter. Where an applicant seeks a variance in conjunction with PUD approval, such request shall be considered by the unified zoning board and city council, but otherwise subject to the restrictions on the grant of a variance provided in section 47-330. 
                  (j)  Abandonment. Whenever the developer or owner of an approved planned unit development has not broken ground on the development within one year of the mayor and council's approval of the plan, the plan shall be deemed abandoned and shall require resubmittal and approval subject to the terms of this chapter before any further land disturbance activities may take place or any further permits may be issued. Whenever the developer has failed to break ground on a phase of a planned unit development for three years from the date of the plan's approval, the plan shall be deemed abandoned as to that phase and shall require resubmittal and approval subject to the terms of this chapter as to that phase before land disturbance activities may occur in the phase or further development permits in the phase may issue.

                  Sec. 47-134. - Downtown Development Area Overlay District. 
                  (a)  Purpose and intent. 
                  (1)  Attractive and integrated architectural and site design features tend to improve an area's image, raise overall property values, attract new businesses and residents, and improve the quality of life. There is a positive return on investment for providing attractive design features, for both government and property owners, and can provide similar enhancements to public safety, community health, and well-being. 
                  (2)  This section establishes an overlay district for a defined area in the historic downtown area of the city consistent with the downtown development area for the purposes of controlling land uses, setting standards and requirements for development, and providing for improved architecture and site design. 
                  (b)  Map of overlay district boundaries. The map entitled "Downtown Development Area Overlay District," which is hereby made a part of this chapter, is hereby adopted. 
                  (c)  Application and relationship to zoning districts. As to properties within the bounds of the Downtown Development Area Overlay District, this article establishes regulations that are in addition to the regulations of the underlying zoning district. Zonings districts established by this chapter, and as shown on the official zoning map, shall continue to apply in the overlay district, except as specifically modified by this section. This article imposes more restrictions on land uses within the overlay district than the rights conferred by underlying zoning and more land development standards than are applied outside the overlay district. 
                  (d)  Regulation of uses. 
                  (1)  Restrictions: Notwithstanding the permitted uses and special uses sections of the zoning districts established in this chapter, the following uses as defined shall not be permitted within the overlay district boundaries: 
                  a.  Vapor shops; 
                  b.  Tattoo or piercing parlors; 
                  c.  Massage parlors; 
                  d.  Pawn shops; 
                  e.  Gas stations; 
                  f.  Group homes; 
                  g.  Animal hospitals, veterinarians and kennels; 
                  h.  Drive-in restaurants; or 
                  i.  Drive-in theatres. 
                  (2)  Land uses that are not permitted by this section, but which lawfully existed at the time this overlay district was first made effective, may continue to exist but shall be considered nonconforming uses subject to the provisions of this chapter pertaining to nonconforming uses. 
                  (e)  Residential uses. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Table of Permitted Uses, on lots zoned C-1 or C-2 in the downtown overlay district, residential use of property shall be allowed subject to the following criteria: 
                  (1)  Single-family residential use consistent with these provisions shall be permitted by right; multifamily use shall be permitted by special use permit; 
                  (2)  Residential use shall be permitted on the second story above ground level of the structure only; and 
                  (3)  At least 50 percent of the ground floor of the structure shall be leasable commercial space not used for parking or self-service storage. 
                  (f)  Design guidelines. To ensure that the properties within the overlay district have a harmonious outward appearance consistent with the historic nature of the downtown district, the following design guidelines shall apply: 
                  (1)  Signs may not be illuminated except that each principal structure may have one internally-illuminated or neon window sign not exceeding three square feet in area. 
                  (2)  A frame, sandwich type sidewalk or curb signs are allowed to be placed in front of the business, but shall not block the sidewalk and must be taken in at close of business. 
                  (3)  Swinging or projecting signs are allowed to be placed on businesses, as long as they do not impair pedestrian traffic. 
                  (4)  Facade easements requiring design approval have been recorded for many of the properties in the downtown development area; owners and occupants are advised to consult the public records prior to beginning any modifications to building facades. No owner or occupant may modify a structure or property in violation of the recorded facade easement. 
                  (5)  Size limitations on signs in DDA. In addition to the requirements of this chapter pertaining to signs, no wall sign shall be more than two feet tall or wider than three quarters of the width of the wall upon which the sign is mounted. 
                  (6)  Fabric or banner signs shall only be permitted to be displayed on a total of 60 days in any calendar year, and no more than 30 consecutive days at one time.

                  ARTICLE VI. - BUFFER REQUIREMENTS 

                  Sec. 47-152. - Required buffers. 
                  (a)  Buffers. A buffer area shall be defined as that portion of a lot set aside for separation or screening purposes, pursuant to the applicable provisions of this article, to separate different use districts and or uses on one property from uses on another property of the same use district or a different use district. Transitional buffers are buffers required between dissimilar zoning districts. 
                  (b)  Buffer requirements. Mandatory buffer widths are listed under each individual zoning district. 
                  (c)  Special exemptions. The following special exceptions apply to buffers and control over general buffer provisions: 
                  (1)  When property zoned C-1, C-2 or O/I is separated by a public road from residentially-zoned property, no buffer shall be required. 
                  (2)  When property zoned IND-G is separated from property in a different zoning classification by a state or federal highway right-of-way of at least 100 feet in width, the required buffer for the IND-G property along such right-of-way shall be reduced to 50 feet. 
                  (d)  Buffer standards. Buffers should be sufficient to provide some screening or protection to neighboring uses, where required by the use and nature of the surrounding area. The particular standards for a specific buffer depend on the nature of the proposed use and the character of the surrounding area. The community development director shall make a determination as to the type of buffer required, following the procedure of subsection (e) of this section. 
                  (1)  The community development director shall have the following discretionary options regarding the standards imposed on a particular buffer and may impose some or all of the following requirements: 
                  a.  Buffers may be required to be left in their natural state with the preexisting vegetation intact. 
                  b.  Buffers may be required to be planted or vegetated with fast growing trees and shrubs (for some or all of the width of the required buffer), in species and quantities to be determined by the community development director. 
                  c.  Open field buffers may be left as open space. 
                  d.  Roads, rights-of-way and streams may be counted towards buffer requirements, or may be left as open space. 
                  e.  The community development director may, in addition or in lieu of other requirements, require a fence be erected. 
                  (2)  Buffers shall be undisturbed, except that buffer areas may be used for sewer and other utility easements, detention ponds, access roads and fences may be erected in buffer areas. 
                  (3)  No structures may be erected in buffers, and buffer areas shall be graded or disturbed only when absolutely necessary. Buffers shall be crossed in such a fashion to minimize incursion into the buffer (i.e., close to perpendicularly). Where possible, buffers shall be restored to an opaque standard after being crossed, and BMPs, as required by the city development regulations (and soil erosion and sedimentation control ordinance), shall be followed at all times. 
                  (4)  If a fence is required by the community development director, it shall be eight feet high, wooden, stone or masonry, and shall be opaque. 
                  (5)  The community development director shall have the authority to administratively vary all requirements in this section. 
                  (6)  The community development director's determination may be appealed to the unified zoning board. See article XII of this chapter. 
                  (e)  Procedure. In the event a development is one that requires buffers, the developer shall inform the community development director of the proposed use and provide information about the size of the operation, dimensions of the building, the planned hours of operation, security lighting and other lighting issues, anticipated traffic flow of customers, suppliers and deliveries, and any other information as required by the community development director. The community development director shall review the surrounding area and the uses and zoning of surrounding property. The community development director shall then determine the appropriate buffering standards under subsection (d) of this section, considering the following criteria: 
                  (1)  The nature of the use and all the information provided about the use and its potential nuisance impact on the neighboring and surrounding properties; 
                  (2)  The existing and adjacent uses that may already impose similar negative impacts on adjoining property; 
                  (3)  The existing dissimilar uses of surrounding property and the current zoning of the surrounding property; 
                  (4)  The location of any nearby residences; and 
                  (5)  The existence of any streams, roads or other rights-of-way, the natural terrain, and the existing topography that may provide buffering.

                  Secs. 47-215—47-236. - Reserved. 
                  ARTICLE IX. - SIGN REGULATIONS 

                  Sec. 47-237. - Purposes. 
                  (a)  It is the purpose of the mayor and city council in enacting these regulations to provide standards to safeguard life, public health, property and welfare by regulating the location, size, illumination, erection, maintenance and quality of materials of all signs. More specifically, signs have a powerful impact on the aesthetic environment of the community, and it is the purpose of this article to encourage an aesthetically attractive environment, allowing sufficient opportunities for communications to serve business, interest groups and the public, while complying with the federal and state constitutions and laws. Signs create visual clutter and therefore should be regulated in their size, location, construction and illumination. Signs can detract from the beauty of the neighborhood and lower property values. In seeking to comply with federal and state law, the city has determined the following: large signs are, as the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized, an aesthetic harm; the state supreme court has upheld sign regulations on the basis of aesthetics and preserving the beauty of environment; and, the 11th Circuit has recognized portable signs are visual clutter and a potential traffic hazard. These holdings show that the city's ordinance is within the law and constitutional, which is a goal of the city. The goal of this article is to avoid being an impermissible content-based regulation, and instead to be a permissible time, place and manner restriction. 
                  (b)  Many signs can also be a hazard and negatively impact traffic safety by distracting drivers and blocking views of other vehicles and dangers, by making intersections more treacherous, and by making it difficult to see oncoming traffic when entering a roadway. Therefore, it is also the purpose of this article to prevent those harms by regulating signs to safe locations, safe sizes, with proper and safe illumination and construction.

                  Sec. 47-238. - Jurisdiction and applicability of code requirements. 
                  (a)  This article shall apply to all properties within the incorporated areas of the city. This article shall not relate to the copy or message on signs within the city. 
                  (b)  All signs and sign structures shall be constructed and maintained in conformance with the state minimum standard codes. 
                  (c)  If any provisions or requirements of this article are in conflict with any other provision or requirement of this article or any other applicable governmental law, ordinance, resolution, rule, or other governmental regulation of any kind, the more restrictive rule or standard takes precedence. 
                  (Min. of 11-10-2016, § 11.2)

                  (a)  No sign shall be placed or maintained within the city except in conformity with this article. 
                  (b)  Notwithstanding any other restrictions in this article, any sign, display or device allowed under this article may contain any commercial or non-commercial message, or any political or non-political message; except that such messages cannot depict obscenity, as defined by O.C.G.A. § 16-12-80, nor can they depict sexual conduct or sexually explicit nudity, as defined in O.C.G.A. § 36-60-3. 
                  (c)  Height limitations in this article control over the general height limitations of this article and apply to any structure that contains a sign. For example, a church spire or radio antenna with a sign would be subject to the height limitations of this article, rather than general height limitations. 
                  (d)  Definitions. The general definitions and interpretative rules of this chapter shall also be used.

                  (Min. of 11-10-2016, § 11.4) 
                  Sec. 47-241. - Regulations for signs. 
                  (a)  Location, height, and setback. 
                  (1)  The property owner must give permission for all sign placement on the owner's property, through the issuance of a letter signed by the owner. 
                  (2)  All signs must comply with all side and rear setbacks of this chapter. 
                  (3)  Signs can be located in front setback areas, but all signs and sign structures, except as noted below, must be set back at least ten feet from the public right-of-way. No portion of a sign or sign structure shall encroach on or overhang the public right-of-way or any other person's property. Furthermore, for safety reasons, no sign shall be located closer than ten feet from the back of the curb of a public roadway, or if there is no curb, from the edge of the pavement. 
                  (4)  Distances are measured from the closest portion of the sign (whether that is the base, sign face, or the sign structure) to the right-of-way, curb or pavement. 
                  (5)  The height requirements of a sign shall be computed as the length of a straight vertical line from normal grade to the height of the highest attached component of the sign or sign structure. When the sign is constructed within 15 feet of a right-of-way, the normal grade shall be considered the elevation of the crown of the road. When a sign is constructed 15 or more feet from any right-of-way, normal grade shall be considered the lower of: 
                  a.  Existing grade of the site of the sign prior to construction of the sign; or 
                  b.  The newly established grade at the base of the sign after construction, exclusive of any filling, beaming, mounding or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. 
                  (b)  Number. For the purpose of determining the number of signs, ground signs shall be equal to the number of sign structures. All other non-ground signs shall be considered to be a single display surface or display device containing elements organized, related and composed to form a unit. 
                  (c)  Illumination. 
                  (1)  Ground signs cannot be internally illuminated except where expressly permitted by this article. All signs may be externally illuminated. External illumination of any sign in any district shall be positioned and shielded so that the light source does not shine directly into the path of motorists on a public right-of-way or into the windows of adjacent dwellings or businesses without the permission of the owner and resident thereof. Signs located in residential districts shall not be illuminated between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. 
                  (2)  Flashing, blinking or otherwise varying illumination are not permitted except on lots fronting on U.S. 41, Highway 140, or Interstate 75. No external or internal illumination that causes confusion with or distraction from any traffic signal or safety device shall be permitted. 
                  (3)  All externally illuminated signs shall utilize low wattage luminaries, mounted in fixtures designed to direct the light and eliminate light trespass, such as light shining into residences or other neighboring structures. 
                  (4)  All internally illuminated signs shall utilize low wattage luminaries designed to reduce light glow. 
                  (5)  All illuminated signs over ten feet in height shall either be internally illuminated or illuminated by external lighting fixtures not visible to passing motorists. 
                  (6)  On lots fronting on Interstate 75, internally illuminated or LED signs are permissible. On lots fronting on U.S. 41 or Highway 140, internally illuminated LED signs are permissible, provided that the area of the LED portion of the sign shall be no more than 32 square feet. 
                  (7)  No sign shall give off light which glares, blinds, or has any other adverse effect on traffic or adjacent properties. The light from an illuminated sign shall be established in such a way that adjacent properties and roadways are not adversely affected and that no direct light is cast upon adjacent properties and roadways. This shall be determined by measuring the footcandles (lumens per square foot) that fall on adjacent properties or the public right-of-way. No sign shall exceed 0.5 footcandles at any adjacent property line in a residential district or two footcandles at any public right-of-way. 
                  (8)  Multiple-message signs. Multiple-message signs are those which change the message or copy on the sign face mechanically or electronically by movement or rotation of panels or slates, or by changing electronic display on the sign face. They are subject to the following restrictions: 
                  a.  No multiple-message sign may change its message or copy, or any pictures or images that are part of the message, more frequently than once every minute, provided that multiple-message billboards shall be allowed to change the copy or images that are part of the message not more frequently than once every ten seconds. 
                  b.  When the message of a multiple-message sign is changed mechanically, it shall be accomplished in three seconds or less. When the message of a multiple-message sign is changed in an electronic manner, through the use of light emitting diodes, back lighting or other light source, the transition shall occur within two seconds. 
                  c.  When any multiple-message sign is located within 150 feet of any residential district, the display of multiple-messages shall discontinue between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., and the sign shall be static and not display more than one message during that period. 
                  (d)  Calculation of area. The area of a sign is calculated by determining the area of the smallest square or rectangle which encloses the sign face and the structure surrounding the sign face. For example, the pole or base would not be included, but any frame holding the sign face in place would be counted. See examples: 
                  Examples of Sign Face Area Measurements 

                  (e)  Unusual shaped signs. Unusual shaped signs are signs that are any shape other than a square or rectangle, and include signs with projecting elements or features, round, oval, and triangular signs, signs with more than four sides, signs in the shape of an animal, object, or device, and so forth. For all such signs, the area is calculated by calculating the area of the smallest rectangle that will completely enclose all elements of the sign face and sign structure supporting the face, not including the base, or any open space. 
                  (f)  Sign support structures. Signs 300 square feet per face or larger must be constructed with a monopole-type support system.

                  Sec. 47-242. - Safety and construction standards. 
                  (a)  Engineering approval. All signs in excess of 15 feet in height should be constructed according to plans approved by a state registered professional engineer. The sign owner shall produce such approved plans at the request of the building official. 
                  (b)  Official confusion. Signs which contain or are in imitation of an official traffic sign or signal are prohibited. 
                  (c)  Fire safety. No sign or sign structure may be erected or maintained which obstructs any fire escape, ventilation, or door; nor shall any sign or sign structure be attached to a fire escape. 
                  (d)  Corner visibility. No sign or sign structure above a height of three feet shall be maintained within 15 feet of the intersection of the right-of-way lines of two streets, or of a street intersection with a railroad right-of-way. 
                  (e)  Traffic visibility. No sign shall obstruct the view of vehicles entering the roadway (i.e., the view of oncoming traffic by vehicles attempting to enter the road). 
                  (f)  Good repair. All signs, together with all their supports, braces, guys, and anchors shall be kept in good repair. Any structure formally used as a sign, but not in use for any other purpose, must be removed by the owner of the property within ten days after written notification from a designated city official or 30 days after its use as a valid sign has ceased, after which time, the city may cause the removal of the sign at the owner's expense. 
                  (g)  Removal of unsafe signs and safety hazards. The city may remove a sign in violation of this article, without giving notice to any party, if said sign is upon the public right-of-way or upon other public property, or said sign poses an immediate safety threat to the life or health of any members of the public.

                  Sec. 47-244. - Procedures; sign registration and building permits. 
                  (a)  Except as specifically exempted from the provisions of this article, a person or firm may not legally maintain, post, display, enlarge, erect, move, or substantially change a sign that is larger than four square feet without first obtaining a permit from the community development director. Signs using electrical wiring and connections (i.e., illuminated signs), as well as larger signs, may require additional permits under the city building code, and the building official should be contacted regarding such signs. 
                  (b)  All parties are advised to consult with the community development director to avoid erecting signs that violate this article. No person shall obtain a vested right to maintain a sign that does not comply with this article at the time it is erected. Signs erected in violation of this article shall be removed or reconstructed in compliance with this article. 
                  (c)  Permit applications for conforming signs shall be filed by the sign owner or his agent with the community development director upon forms furnished by the city. 
                  (1)  Applications. Applications shall contain the following: 
                  a.  The type of the sign as defined in this article.

                  (2)  Fees. No permit shall be issued until the appropriate application has been filed with the community development director and permit fees have been paid as adopted by the mayor and city council and as amended from time to time. 
                  (3)  Granting of permit. The community development director or his designee shall grant a permit upon receipt of a completed application if the proposed sign meets the requirements of this article. 
                  (4)  Permit expiration. A permit shall become null and void if construction of the sign has not begun within six months from the date of issuance. Issuance of a permit shall in no way prevent the city from later declaring the sign to be nonconforming or unlawful if, with further review of available information, the sign is found not to comply with the requirements of the ordinance applicable at the time that the complete permit application was filed. 
                  (5)  Violation. A violation of any provisions of this article will be grounds for termination of a permit granted by the city for the erection of a sign. Should it be determined that a permit was issued pursuant to an incomplete application or an application containing a false material statement, or that a permit has been erroneously issued in violation of this article, the community development director or his designee shall revoke the permit. No information shall be required regarding the content of the sign. Any person failing to obtain a permit prior to construction shall be subject to citation and, upon conviction, shall be punished in accordance with the enforcement provisions of this chapter and applicable law.

                  Sec. 47-245. - Nonconforming signs. 
                  Signs existing legally at the time of the adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this article is derived, but which do not conform to newly adopted or amended provisions of this article solely because of a change in this article, and not because of a change to the sign, may remain as legal nonconforming signs, subject to the following provisions: 
                  (1)  There must be existing property rights in the sign; 
                  (2)  The right to continue a nonconforming sign is confined to the sign owner or his transferee; 
                  (3)  A nonconforming sign may be restored to its original condition, provided that not more than 50 percent of the sign is destroyed. The 50 percent is to be determined by 50 percent of the value of the materials of the sign, inclusive of poles and other structural members, immediately prior to damage; 
                  (4)  A nonconforming sign when relocated or moved shall no longer be considered a nonconforming sign and thereafter shall be subject to all the provisions of law and of these rules relating to outdoor advertising; 
                  (5)  The sign must remain substantially the same as it was on the effective date of the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived which rendered the sign nonconforming. Extension, enlargement, replacement, rebuilding, adding lights to a non-illuminated sign or re-erection of the sign will be considered a change in the existing use. The maintenance will be limited to: 
                  a.  Replacement of nuts and bolts; 
                  b.  Additional nailing, riveting or welding; 
                  c.  Cleaning and painting; 
                  d.  Manipulating to level or plumb the device, but not to the extent of adding guys or struts for stabilization of the sign structure; 
                  e.  A change of the message, including changing faces, as long as similar materials are used and the sign face is not enlarged; 
                  (6)  At no time may changes be made in a nonconforming sign which would increase the value of the sign; 
                  (7)  A nonconforming sign may continue as long as it is not abandoned, destroyed, discontinued, or purchased by any governmental agency. Any sign suffering damage in excess of normal wear cannot be repaired without: 
                  a.  Notifying the community development director in writing of the extent of the damage, the reason the damage is in excess of normal wear, and providing a description of the repair work to be undertaken, including the value of the sign materials and the cost of the repair; and 
                  b.  Receiving written notice from the community development director authorizing the repair work as described above. If said repair is authorized by the terms of this article, the community development director shall mail such notice to the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the information described in subsection (7)a of this section.

Towers and antennas permitted and erected prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived or amendment thereto shall be deemed preexisting, and shall not be subject to the requirements of this article. The placement of additional antennas on any nonconforming structure shall not create a vested right for the continued use of the structures should the nonconforming use cease. If an additional antenna is co-located on a legally preexisting tower, the requirements of this article shall be met. 
                  (Min. of 11-10-2016, § 12.3) 
                  Sec. 47-272. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  Special use required. A special use permit shall be required for the placement of any tower or alternative tower structure, except as otherwise permitted herein. Procedures for special use permits sought under this article are contained in section 47-273. 
                  (b)  Principal or accessory use. A tower and/or antenna is considered a principal use if located on any lot or parcel of land as the sole or primary structure, and is considered an accessory use if located on a lot or parcel shared with a different existing primary use or existing structures. An existing use or structure on the same lot or parcel shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with zoning district requirements, including, but not limited to, setback, buffer and other requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot or parcel shall control, even though the antenna or tower may be located on a leased area within such lot or parcel. Towers that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this article shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use of structure. 
                  (c)  Co-location of antennas required. Applicants for the erection of a tower or antenna, except amateur radio operators, shall be required to co-locate upon an existing tower structure, if possible. An exception to co-location shall only be made if the applicant submits a report from an engineer demonstrating that an existing tower suitable for co-location does not exist in the geographic antenna placement area, and that no suitable alternative tower structure is available, or if the applicant submits an affidavit showing that while a suitable tower may exist, no space is available thereon. Co-location is permissible provided the new antenna will add no more than ten feet to the height of the tower and related equipment or appurtenances. Increasing the antenna height more than ten feet requires a special use permit. Co-location requires only a building permit, and the information described in section 47-275(b). 
                  (Min. of 11-10-2016, § 12.4) 
                  Sec. 47-273. - Special use permit required. 
                  (a)  General. 
                  (1)  A special use permit shall be required for the construction of a new tower in any zoning district. All such uses shall comply with requirements set forth in this article and all other applicable codes and ordinances, unless the applicant can show that the denial of a permit in such a location will cause a significantly harmful and permanent degradation of service which cannot be overcome by any other means including planned or potential locations which would provide the same or similar coverage or capacity. 
                  (2)  In granting a special use permit, the city may impose conditions to the extent that it concludes such conditions are necessary to minimize adverse effects from the proposed tower on adjoining or nearby properties as set out in subsection (f) of this section. 
                  (b)  Application; contents; fee. All applications for special use permits shall be submitted to the city community development director. Each application shall contain as a part thereof detailed plans and specifications as set forth in section 47-275. An application for a special use permit shall not be accepted for processing without the information required in section 47-275. An application fee shall be charged by the department in the amount stated in section 47-276. 
                  (c)  Independent expert review. The city may engage a licensed professional engineer as an independent expert to review any of the materials submitted by an applicant for a special use permit and render an opinion regarding any concerns about the proposal, including, but not limited to, structural integrity and the feasibility of alternative sites or co-location. Following the review of an independent expert, the city shall convey its concerns to the applicant in writing and shall allow the applicant a reasonable opportunity to address those concerns. If the applicant is unable to satisfactorily address those concerns, the applicant shall be allowed a reasonable amount of time, not to exceed 30 days, following the receipt of the letter in which to modify the application to alleviate the city's concerns or withdraw the application altogether. The expert's opinion shall be considered determinative, unless the applicant agrees to pay the expenses of submitting both opinions for a peer review, which review shall then be considered final. If the independent third-party expert supports the applicant's expert, then the department shall pay the expenses of said third-party expert. If the independent third-party expert supports the position of the department, then the applicant shall pay the expenses of said third-party expert. 
                  (d)  Public hearing. Before taking action upon the proposed special use permit, the city shall hold a public hearing on the matter consistent with the procedures of article XIV of this chapter. 
                  (e)  Considerations in approval or denial of special use permits. Any denial of a request to place, construct or modify a telecommunications facility shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record. The following factors may be taken into consideration in acting upon a special use permit application under the provisions of this article: 
                  (1)  The height and setbacks of the proposed tower or antenna; 
                  (2)  The proximity of the tower or antenna to residential structures and residential district boundaries; 
                  (3)  The nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties; 
                  (4)  The surrounding topography; 
                  (5)  The surrounding tree coverage and foliage; 
                  (6)  The design of the tower or antenna, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness; 
                  (7)  The proposed ingress and egress; 
                  (8)  The availability of suitable existing towers or other structures for antenna co-location; 
                  (9)  The impact of the proposed tower or antenna upon scenic views and visual quality of the surrounding area; 
                  (10)  The needs of the applicant as balanced against the detrimental effects on surrounding properties; and 
                  (11)  The impact of the proposed tower or antenna on adjacent and nearby properties. 
                  (f)  Requirements for issuance of special use permit. The special use permit may be issued by the city only upon satisfaction of the following requirements: 
                  (1)  A proper application filed in accordance with the requirements of section 47-275; 
                  (2)  The application is otherwise in compliance with or otherwise is satisfactory in considering the standards contained in subsection (e) of this section; 
                  (3)  The applicant complies with the conditions proposed by the city for the purpose of reducing the harmful effects of the use on surrounding uses and ensuring compatibility with surrounding uses; 
                  (4)  The city determines that the benefits and need for the proposed special use are greater than any possible depreciating effects or damages to neighboring or nearby properties; and 
                  (5)  All fees, including expert fees, have been paid in full. 
                  (g)  Resubmittal of special use application. An application for a special use permit which has been denied shall not be resubmitted for a period of 12 months, and then only if the applicant can document a substantial change in need for a tower or antenna at the same location. 
                  (h)  Time. All co-location applications shall be ruled upon within 90 days of the filing of a completed application; all other applications shall be ruled upon within 150 days of a completed application. Applications which are not completed at the time of filing shall not be accepted, and city staff shall review the application to verify completeness within 30 days from the filing of the application. In the event that an application is determined to not be complete within the initial 30-day period after filing, city staff shall promptly notify the applicant, and the time for issuance of the decision shall be tolled for the time period between such notification to the applicant and the date the applicant files materials which complete the application. The time periods within this subparagraph may be extended by the mutual consent of the city and the applicant. 
                  (Min. of 11-10-2016, § 12.5) 
                  Sec. 47-274. - General requirements for towers. 
                  (a)  Setbacks and separation. The following setbacks and separation requirements shall apply to all towers. 
                  (1)  Towers shall be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower from its base to any public right-of-way or occupied structure, or property line of the lot or parcel containing the tower, except when a property owner or adjoining property owner consents in writing to waive the setback and the applicant clearly demonstrates that the tower will collapse within the parent parcel. 
                  (2)  Guy wires and accessory buildings and facilities shall meet the minimum accessory use location and setback requirements. 
                  (3)  In zoning districts other than IND-H, towers shall not be located closer than 500 feet from any existing tower. This requirement shall not apply to amateur radio towers. 
                  (4)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, no tower or antenna shall be permitted in a residential neighborhood or within 1,000 feet of any residential dwelling unless the applicant can show that the denial of a permit in such a location will cause a significantly harmful and permanent degradation of service which cannot be overcome by any other means including planned or potential locations which would provide the same or similar coverage or capacity. 
                  (5)  The requirement of subsection (a)(4) of this section may be waived by the adjacent property owner. In such cases, the applicant shall submit a notarized affidavit from the adjacent owner, identifying the property owned, and affirming that he agrees that the tower can be erected at the proposed location, which shall be specifically described, including its distance from that owner's residential dwelling. The affidavit shall further specifically state that the affiant understands that he or she is waiving his rights under this subsection. Waivers shall be required of all property owners whose dwellings are located within 1,000 feet of the proposed tower. 
                  (b)  Aesthetics. The guidelines set forth in this subsection shall govern the design and construction of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this article and shall be approved by the director. 
                  (1)  Towers and/or antennas shall either maintain a galvanized steel or concrete finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  (2)  At all tower sites, the design of all buildings and related structures shall use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and building environment. Any equipment or cabinet that supports telecommunication facilities must be concealed from public view and made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained. 
                  (3)  For antennas installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical ground equipment shall be of a neutral color so as to make the antenna and related equipment visually unobtrusive. 
                  (4)  Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the city may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. The lighting shall be dimmed or changed to red lights from the sunset to sunrise. 
                  (5)  No signage or other identifying markings of a commercial nature shall be permitted upon any tower or alternative tower structure within the city. 
                  (6)  To the extent practical, telecommunication facilities shall not be placed in a direct line of sight with historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or by any state or federal law or agency. 
                  (7)  Access to the tower site shall be restricted so as to minimize visibility of the access. Where possible, existing roads shall be used. Where no roads exist, access shall follow the existing contours of the land. 
                  (8)  Such other additional requirements as the director shall reasonably require to minimize the visual impact of the site on the surrounding area. 
                  (c)  Security fencing/anti-climbing devices. All towers and supporting equipment shall be enclosed by fencing not less than six feet in height and shall also be equipped with appropriate anti-climbing devices. Fencing shall be of chain link, wood or other approved alternative. 
                  (d)  Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern landscaping surrounding all towers: 
                  (1)  Where adequate vegetation is not present, tower facilities shall be landscaped with a landscaped strip of plant materials which effectively screens the view of the tower compound. Landscaped strips shall be a minimum of ten feet in width and located outside the fenced perimeter of the compound. 
                  (2)  Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. Where natural vegetation around the perimeter of the site would provide an adequate visual screen, an undisturbed buffer may be utilized. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost. 
                  (3)  Landscaping shall be maintained by the provider and shall be subject to periodic review by the director to ensure proper maintenance. Failure to maintain landscaping shall be deemed a violation of this article. 
                  (4)  Amateur radio towers and antennas, or receive-only antennas, shall not be subject to the provision of this subsection unless required by the city through the special use permit process. 
                  (e)  Maintenance impacts. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector or local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector or local street, utilizing existing access to the property on which such facility is to be located, where possible. 
                  (f)  Review of tower and antenna erection by the airport authority. If, upon receipt of an application for the erection of any tower or alternative tower structure governed by this article, the department deems that the proposed structure may interfere with or affect the use of the airways of the city by the public or interfere with or affect the operation of existing or proposed airport facilities, a copy of the application shall be submitted by the department to the Cartersville-Bartow County Airport Authority for review and recommendation. 
                  (g)  Federal requirements; removal of towers. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, the permittee or the lessee of the tower and antenna governed by this article shall bring such tower and/or antenna into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations unless a more or less stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring such tower and/or antenna into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall be deemed to be a declaration of abandonment of the tower and constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's, permittee's, or lessee's expense. Any such removal by the city shall be in the manner provided in the city unfit property ordinance then in effect. 
                  (h)  Building codes; safety standards; removal of towers. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner, permittee or subsequent lessee of a tower or alternative tower structure shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable standard building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the department concludes that a tower fails to comply with all applicable codes and standards, or constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon receipt of written notice by the owner, permittee or lessee of the tower, said party shall have 15 days to bring the tower into compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such tower into compliance within 15 days shall be deemed a declaration of abandonment of the tower and constitute grounds for removal of the tower as provided in the city unfit property ordinance. Prior to the removal of any tower, the department may consider detailed plans submitted by the owner, permittee or subsequent lessee for repair of substandard towers, and may grant a reasonable extension of the above-referenced compliance period. Abandoned towers or towers deemed unsafe may also be removed under the city unfit property ordinance procedures. 
                  (i)  Change of ownership notification. Upon the transfer of ownership of an interest in any tower, alternative tower structure, or lot upon which such a structure has been erected, the tower permittee shall notify the department of the transaction in writing within 30 days.

                  (5)  Fines shall be assessed in accordance with section 47-303. 
                  (f)  Civil fines and proceedings. In addition to or in lieu of any other remedy, the city may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in superior court to enjoin or prevent a violation of any provision of this chapter. Such action may also seek civil fines at the mandatory rates specified in section 47-303 for violation of this chapter, and may additionally seek the costs of restitution, and any other costs associated with the action to enjoin or prevent any violation of any provision of this chapter. The city shall be entitled to its reasonable attorney's fees and costs for bringing an action in superior court wherein any relief is granted or fine assessed. 
                  (g)  Stop-work orders. Upon notice from the community development director, designated code enforcement officers, or other authorized personnel, work on any project that is being done contrary to the provisions of this chapter shall be immediately stopped. 
                  (1)  Stop-work orders shall affect all work being done on a project or development (including work done on other lots in the subdivision owned by the same violator). Stop-work orders stop not only the work in violation, but all other work by contractors or sub-contractors on the same property. Only work to remedy the deficiency shall be allowed until the stop-work order is lifted. 
                  (2)  A stop-work order shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner of the property, his authorized agent, or the person or persons in charge of the activity on the property, and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed. Where an emergency or other exigent circumstances exist, no written notice shall be required, and a verbal stop-work order may be issued, with a written order to be provided within three working days. 
                  a.  Stop-work orders may be issued on their own, or in conjunction with criminal citations, or civil proceedings in superior court. 
                  b.  Issuance of a stop-work order may be appealed to the unified zoning board. 
                  (h)  Additional penalties. Persons cited are also subject to other penalties within the jurisdiction of the municipal court.

                  Sec. 47-303. - Fine schedule. 
                  Fines assessed under this chapter shall be assessed according to the following mandatory schedule, whether assessed as a civil fine in superior court, or assessed as a penalty upon conviction in magistrate court. The maximum permissible fine shall be $1,000.00 per offense. In no event shall a fine be reduced below the mandatory minimum, as set forth below. Fines may be increased by mandatory add-ons under state law. As a deterrent to violation, second and subsequent violations by the same offender of any provision of this chapter, whether violations of the same or different provisions of this chapter as the initial violation, and whether involving the same or different property, shall increase the fine owing. However, repeated citations for the same violation on a second and subsequent days shall not count as a subsequent violation, but shall rather be assessed at the same rate as the initial violation. Note: "Per vehicle" additions relate to violations such as junk vehicles, parking violations, and similar violations, where each vehicle is in violation of the chapter. 
                  (1)  First violation. For the first violation of any provision of this chapter by any violator (whether an individual or corporation), the fine shall be as follows, unless otherwise noted: 

                   
                  (2)  Second violation. For the second violation of any provision of this chapter (whether the same or different as the first violation) by the same violator (whether an individual or corporation), the fine shall be as follows, unless otherwise noted: 

                   
                  (3)  Third and subsequent violations. For the third and subsequent violation of any provision of this chapter (whether the same or different as the prior two violations) by the same violator (whether an individual or corporation), the fine shall be as follows, unless otherwise noted:

                  Sec. 47-327. - Administrative variances. 
                  If, in the judgment of the community development director, the application of any particular numeric criteria, standard or requirement of this chapter causes undue hardship on the applicant, the community development director shall be empowered to grant an administrative variance to alter said requirement by up to 20 percent if, in doing so, the purposes of this chapter are not impaired and there is not a negative impact on the surrounding uses, properties, or neighbors. In granting an administrative variance, the community development director may attach such conditions as the community development director may deem advisable so that the purpose of this chapter will be served, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. The community development director shall not be authorized to grant a use variance to permit a use in a district in which the use is prohibited. An administrative variance shall be granted or denied in writing. Notice of the grant of an administrative variance shall be sent to all adjoining property owners via first class mail by the applicant. The notice shall describe the variance granted and state that interested parties have 30 days in which to file an appeal of the variance. Only owners reflected on the records of the tax assessors as of the date of the application shall be entitled to notice. Proof of mailing, as described in section 47-331(c), shall be submitted to the zoning department within ten days of grant of the variance. The 30 days shall be counted from the date of mailing of the notice.

                  Sec. 47-328. - Establishment of unified zoning board. 
                  (a)  The unified zoning board is hereby established. It shall be a combination of the existing board of appeals and planning commission. The unified zoning board shall have a total of 11 seats, which shall initially be filled by the holders of the three seats on the board of appeals and the eight seats on the planning commission, each of whom shall continue in their current terms unaffected by the adoption of this article. The unified zoning board shall be authorized to perform all duties and actions and hear all matters that either the board of appeals or the planning commission were authorized to consider prior to the adoption of this article. References in this or other ordinances of the city Code to the board of appeals or planning commission shall be deemed a reference to the unified zoning board. 
                  (b)  Members shall serve without pay but may be reimbursed for any expenses incurred while representing the board. Any vacancy in the membership of the unified zoning board shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as the initial appointment. Members shall be removable for cause by the city council upon written charges and after public hearing. The failure of a member of the unified zoning board to attend three consecutive public meetings shall be deemed an abandonment of office effective immediately upon the conclusion of the third consecutive meeting, and the vacancy may be filled by the city council. Absences may be excused by a majority vote of the remainder of the unified zoning board for good cause shown.

                  Sec. 47-329. - Proceedings of the unified zoning board. 
                  (a)  The unified zoning board shall elect a chairperson and a vice chairperson from its members who shall serve for three years or until re-elected or until their successors are elected. The board shall appoint a secretary, who may be a city officer, an employee of the city, or a member of the board. The board shall adopt such rules and bylaws as they deem appropriate. The board shall meet every other month or on such schedule as it chooses to adopt, but no less than four times per year, providing there are matters to consider. If there are no agenda items, the regularly scheduled meeting shall be cancelled. 
                  (b)  Meetings of the unified zoning board shall be held at the call of the chairperson and at such other times as the board may determine. The chairperson, or in his absence the vice chairperson, may administer oaths to witnesses. 
                  (c)  The unified zoning board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question, or if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the board and may be a public record. 
                  (d)  All meetings of the unified zoning board shall be open to the public, except where a meeting is closed in compliance with the state Open Meetings Act.

                  Sec. 47-330. - Powers and duties of the unified zoning board. 
                  The unified zoning board shall have the following powers and duties: 
                  (1)  Appeals. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the community development director in the enforcement of this chapter. Appeals to the unified zoning board may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board, or bureau of the city affected by any decision of the community development director. Such appeal shall be taken within 30 days of said decision by filing with the community development director a written notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. Decisions on appeals shall be issued in writing within ten days of the appeal. 
                  (2)  Variances. The unified zoning board has the power to hear requests for variances from the provisions of this chapter. Variances may be granted only if the board finds all of the following to exist: 
                  a.  That one of the following is true, through no action or fault of the property owner or predecessor: 
                  1.  The property is exceptionally narrow, shallow or unusually shaped; 
                  2.  The property contains exceptional topographic conditions; 
                  3.  The property contains other extraordinary or exceptional conditions; 
                  4.  There are existing other extraordinary or exceptional circumstances; and 
                  b.  That the strict application of the requirements of this chapter would result in practical difficulties to, or undue hardship upon, the owner of this property; and 
                  c.  That the requested variance relief may be granted without substantially impairing the intent and purpose of this chapter. 
                  Variance decisions shall be issued in writing within ten days of the hearing. 
                  (3)  Conditions. In granting a variance, the unified zoning board may attach such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed building, structure or use as it may deem advisable so that the purpose of this chapter will be served, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. 
                  (4)  Limitations on variances; improper variance requests. Variances cannot be given to totally remove a requirement or to exempt a property or applicant entirely from a requirement. If a variance is being sought that is, in the judgment of the community development director, a request that would constitute a text amendment, then the application shall not be accepted. For example, a request to be exempted from the Etowah Valley Historic District requirements would not be the subject of a variance. The applicant shall instead be directed to file for a text amendment. Variances can only be given to alter a numeric value, such as a setback, height limit, area limit, and so forth. Furthermore, the unified zoning board shall not be authorized to grant a density variance or a use variance to permit a use in a district in which the use is prohibited. A variance application shall not be accepted if the variance seeks something that cannot be varied. A variance application shall not be accepted if the variance is contradictory to this chapter (such as reducing a requirement to zero or totally eliminating a requirement). 
                  (5)  Self-inflicted hardship. The board shall not grant variances when the hardship was created by the property owner or his predecessor, and shall not grant hardship variances based on shape or topography for lots of record not existing prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived or amendment thereto. Configuring a subdivision to create lots that are difficult to build is an example of a hardship created by the property owner or predecessor that do not justify a variance. 
                  (6)  Place of worship. In compliance with federal law, if the variance is requested by a place of worship or church, in connection with the exercise of religion, the board shall additionally consider whether the regulation imposes a substantial burden on the exercise of religion, whether the regulation serves a compelling governmental interest, whether the denial is the least restrictive means to serve that interest, or whether the variance can be granted without harming that interest. 
                  (7)  Reasonable accommodation variance. Notwithstanding any other ordinance provisions to the contrary, the unified zoning board shall consider and grant reasonable accommodations necessary to afford persons with disabilities equal housing opportunities. In determining whether a particular accommodation is reasonable and necessary, the unified zoning board shall consider whether: 
                  a.  The accommodation is necessary, because of a disability, to allow the applicant an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the dwelling of his choice; 
                  b.  The request imposes an undue burden or expense on the city; and 
                  c.  The proposed accommodation would create a fundamental alteration in the zoning scheme. 
                  An application for a reasonable accommodation variance shall comply with all other procedural requirements for consideration and approval of variances under this chapter.

                  Sec. 47-331. - Applications, hearings and notice. 
                  (a)  Applications. Applications for appeals or variances must be filed in accordance with the schedule set out by the community development director. The contents of the application shall be determined by the community development director. The community development director shall forthwith transmit to the board all documents constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. Variances may be sought by filing an application on forms provided by the community development director. 
                  (b)  Published notice. Due notice of the public hearings pursuant to this article shall be published in the newspaper of general circulation within the city. Notice advertising the hearing on the appeal or variance and indicating date, time, place and purpose of the public hearing shall be published at least 15 days but not more than 45 days prior to the date of the hearing. The cost of the advertisement shall be borne by the applicant. For variances, the community development director shall post, at least 15 days prior to the unified zoning board's public hearing, in a conspicuous place in the public right-of-way fronting the property or on the property for which an application has been submitted, a sign or signs containing information as to the application number, date, time and place of the public hearing. 
                  (c)  Letters to adjacent property owners. The applicant for said appeal or variance shall also give notice of the appeal or variance and the public hearing thereon to all property owners adjoining the property for which said appeal or variance is made or sought. Said notice shall be given to each adjoining property owner by first class mail, with proof of mailing obtained from the post office. Proof of mailing means either a first class certificate of mailing or a first class certified mail receipt; a proof of delivery is not required. Only owners reflected on the records of the tax assessors as of the date of the application shall be entitled to notice. In determining the adjoining property owners, road, street or railroad rights-of-way shall be disregarded. Proof of mailing for each recipient shall be provided to the community development director before the public hearing. Said notice must be mailed at least 15 days prior to the date of said scheduled public hearing. 
                  (d)  Information in notice. The notice required herein to be published and to be served upon adjacent property owners shall contain the following information: 
                  (1)  Name and address of the applicant; 
                  (2)  Address and location of the property for which the appeal or variance is sought; 
                  (3)  Current zoning of the property for which the appeal or variance is sought; 
                  (4)  The variance requested or the subject matter of the appeal and the reason for the requested variance or the appeal; and 
                  (5)  The date, time and place of the public hearing on said requested appeal or variance. 
                  (e)  Recording hearing. The applicant may arrange for and provide a certified court reporter to transcribe the hearing before the unified zoning board, at the expense of the applicant. Upon appeal of the decision of the unified zoning board, said transcript shall be made part of the record for review. Board hearings shall also be recorded by video or audio tape.

                  Sec. 47-332. - Stay of proceedings. 
                  An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the community development director certifies to the unified zoning board after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would in his opinion cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a stay granted by the unified zoning board or by a restraining order issued by a court of record on application, on notice to the community development director, and for due cause shown.

                  (a)  In exercising its powers, the unified zoning board may, in conformity with the provisions of this article, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirements, decision, or determination, and to that end shall have all the powers of the community development director. 
                  (b)  The concurring vote of a majority of the members present of the board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of the community development director, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this article or to affect any variation of this article. 
                  (c)  On all appeals, applications and other matters brought before the unified zoning board, said board shall inform, in writing, all the parties involved of its decisions and the reasons therefore. Such written decision shall be prepared by the zoning staff or city attorney and be signed by the secretary.

                  Sec. 47-334. - Conduct of the unified zoning board's hearing. 
                  (a)  Sign up. All persons who wish to address the unified zoning board at a hearing concerning an appeal or variance under consideration by the unified zoning board shall first sign up on a form to be provided by the city prior to the commencement of the hearing. 
                  (b)  Matter presented; out of order applications. The secretary of the unified zoning board will read the proposed appeal or variance under consideration in the order determined by the community development director. The community development director, or his designee, shall then present the basis of the appeal or variance, along with the pertinent departmental reviews, if any, prior to receiving public input on the proposed appeal or variance. Any appeal or variance that has not complied with all notice and other requirements of this article shall be deemed out of order and shall not be considered at that hearing. It shall be postponed until the next meeting, and if it is still out of order at the next meeting, the application shall be deemed denied. 
                  (c)  Speakers. The secretary of the unified zoning board shall call each person who has signed up to speak on the appeal or variance then before the unified zoning board in the order in which the persons have signed up to speak, except the applicant who will always speak first. Prior to speaking, the speaker will identify himself and state his current address. Only those persons who signed up to speak prior to the commencement of the hearing shall be entitled to speak, unless a majority of the members of the unified zoning board present at the hearing allow the person to speak to the appeal or variance, notwithstanding the failure of the person to sign up prior to the hearing. 
                  (d)  Time limits. The applicant or appellant and those in favor of the variance or appeal shall have 15 minutes to speak, total. Those opposed to the application or appeal shall have 15 minutes to speak, total. The board may extend these times upon majority vote. Each individual speaker shall have no more than three minutes to speak, except the applicant, who can take as much of the 15 minutes as is desired. The applicant may reserve time for rebuttal. Upon vote of a majority of the board, either side may be granted additional time in any amount the board desires, but in such event, the other side shall be granted the same additional time. 
                  (e)  Evidence, cross examination. Each side shall have the opportunity to present evidence and witnesses which shall be entered into the record. Cross examination of opposing witnesses shall be allowed by the chair, but decorum shall be maintained. The board may require the applicant and opponents to designate one person to conduct any desired cross examination. 
                  (f)  Decorum and order. Each speaker shall speak only to the merits of the proposed appeal or variance under consideration and shall address his remarks only to the members of the unified zoning board. Each speaker shall refrain from personal attacks on any other speaker or the discussion of facts or opinions irrelevant to the proposed appeal under consideration. The chair may limit or refuse a speaker the right to continue if the speaker, after first being cautioned, continues to violate this subsection. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting the chair from conducting the hearing in an orderly and decorous manner to ensure that the public hearing on the appeal or variance is conducted in a fair and orderly manner.

                  Sec. 47-359. - Initiation of amendments. 
                  (a)  Text amendment. An application to amend the text of this chapter may be initiated by the unified zoning board or be submitted to the unified zoning board by the mayor and city council, zoning staff, or by any person having an interest in the city. 
                  (b)  Map amendment. An application to amend the official zoning map may be initiated by the unified zoning board or be submitted to the unified zoning board by the mayor and city council or zoning staff, property owner or agent of the owner. Unless initiated by the mayor and city council, the unified zoning board or zoning staff, all applications to amend the official zoning map must be submitted by an owner of the affected property or an authorized agent of an owner, following procedures set forth in sections 47-360 and 47-361. If submitted by an agent of the owner, such authorization shall be notarized and attached to the application. If a property has multiple owners, only one owner need file the application, and it will be assumed that the other owners consent; however, if any owner does not consent to the application (or otherwise objects), the rezoning application will not go forward. If owned by a corporation or other entity, the application must be filed by a person with proper corporate or entity authority, and the community development director may require documentation to support a claim of authority. 
                  (c)  Resubmission after denial. In the event an application for an amendment to the zoning map has been denied, another rezoning application affecting the same property shall not be submitted nor accepted until 12 months have passed from the date of the final decision by the mayor and city council. 
                  (d)  Alter conditions. An application to alter conditions of rezoning may be submitted at any time after the final decision of the mayor and city council. The applicant must show a change in circumstances or additional information not available to the applicant at the time of the original decision by the mayor and city council to impose the condition. Another application to alter the same condition shall not be submitted more than once every 12 months, such interval to begin on the date of the final decision by the mayor and city council on said application to amend the condition. 
                  (e)  Withdrawal. An application may be withdrawn without prejudice at any time prior to 6:00 p.m. on the day of the unified zoning board's hearing. The unified zoning board may give permission for a withdrawal without prejudice at its hearing. Withdrawal after the unified zoning board's hearing shall mean such application may not be resubmitted for consideration for a period of six months, counting from the date of withdrawal to the date of renewed application. Unless withdrawn at the hearing, the withdrawal must be in writing, signed and dated by the applicant. 
                  (f)  Campaign contribution disclosures. Applicants and opponents to rezoning actions that change the zoning district on a parcel are requested to consult the Conflict of Interest in Zoning Act, O.C.G.A. § 36-67A-1, which requires disclosure of campaign contributions, made within two years of the rezoning application, and aggregating $250.00 or more, to any unified zoning board member or city elected official. Such disclosures should be filed at least five calendar days prior to the unified zoning board's hearing on forms available at the zoning office. Violation of this Act shall not affect the validity of the rezoning, but such action may be a misdemeanor under O.C.G.A. § 36-67A-4.

                  (a)  Applications. Each application required by this article, including, without limitation, to amend this chapter or the official zoning map, shall be filed with the community development director. The following requirements for information are mandatory, unless the requirement is deleted by the community development director: the community development director may require additional information to evaluate the application, the suitability of the proposed use, and other aspects of any proposed development, and any such information shall be provided. Such information is not required for city-initiated applications.

The secretary of the unified zoning board will read the proposed amendments under consideration in the order determined by the community development director. The community development director, or his designee, shall then present the amendment, along with the pertinent departmental reviews, if any, prior to receiving public input on the proposed amendment. If an application is not complete, or all requirements of this article have not been complied with, the application is out of order and may be taken off the agenda. It shall be postponed until the next meeting of the unified zoning board. If the application has already been advertised and persons wishing to speak have appeared for the hearing, the board may choose to hear from them, but an additional hearing shall be required. If the application is still incomplete or out of order at the next meeting, it shall be deemed withdrawn. The applicant shall have to wait six months to reapply. 
                  (c)  Speakers. The secretary of the unified zoning board will then call each person who has signed up to speak on the amendment in the order in which the persons have signed up to speak, except the applicant who will always speak first. Prior to speaking, the speaker will identify himself and state his current address. Only those persons who signed up to speak prior to the commencement of the hearing shall be entitled to speak, unless a majority of the board, in its discretion, allows the person to speak to the amendment, notwithstanding the failure of the person to sign up prior to the hearing.

Each speaker shall be allowed five minutes to address the unified zoning board concerning the amendment then under consideration, unless the unified zoning board, by majority vote of the members present, votes to allow additional time for a particular speaker to address the board on said proposed amendment.

The applicant may initially use all of the time allotted to him to speak, or he may speak and reserve a portion of his allotted time for rebuttal.

In all circumstances, in order to comply with state law, the proponent(s) and opponent(s) of each amendment shall have no less than ten minutes per side for presentation of data, evidence, and opinion thereon; if there is only one applicant or opponent, such person shall have the full ten minutes if desired. In the event the opponents collectively take more than ten minutes, the applicant's time shall be extended similarly if desired. One member of the unified zoning board shall be designated as the timekeeper to record the time expended by each speaker. 
                  (e)  Decorum and order. Each speaker shall speak only to the merits of the proposed amendment under consideration and shall address his remarks only to the members of the unified zoning board. Each speaker shall refrain from personal attacks on any other speaker or the discussion of facts or opinions irrelevant to the proposed amendment under consideration. The chairperson may limit or refuse a speaker the right to continue if the speaker, after first being cautioned, continues to violate this subsection. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting the chair from conducting the hearing in an orderly and decorous manner to ensure that the public hearing on a proposed amendment is conducted in a fair and orderly manner.

So that the purpose of this chapter will be served, health, public safety and general welfare secured, the mayor and city council may approve or deny the application, reduce the land area for which the application is made, change the district or land use category requested, or add or delete conditions of the application. The mayor and city council shall have the power to impose a different zoning classification from the classification requested, and impose any zoning conditions which ameliorate the impact of the zoning, or serve other lawful purposes of this chapter. The submission of an application for a rezoning shall be deemed notice of this power and consent to any such action. The mayor and city council may also remand the application, if it has been changed or for any reason, to the unified zoning board for further review and recommendation. 
                  (c)  Tabling application. The mayor and city council shall have the power to table incomplete applications or to seek more time for further information to be submitted. The action by the mayor and city council to table the application shall include a statement of the date and time of the next meeting at which the application will be considered, which statement shall constitute public notice of the hearing on the application, and no further notice, such as that required by section 47-361, is required.
