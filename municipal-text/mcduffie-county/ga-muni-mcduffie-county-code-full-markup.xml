PREFACE

        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a complete codification of the general and permanent ordinances of McDuffie County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Palmer Carr, Supervising Editor, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
                  The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Joyce R. Blevins, Chairman of the Board of Commissioners, Ms. Ann Roberts, County Clerk, and Mr. Roger W. Dunaway, Jr., County Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the county readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the county's affairs. 

                   
                  ADOPTING ORDINANCE

               --- (1) --- 
               Editor's note—Printed herein is the 1955 act of the general assembly, as amended, which created the board of commissioners of the county. It may be cited as 1955 Ga. Laws, page 2331. Amendments to the act are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original act. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-5-20, the words "roads and revenues" have been stricken from the name of the governing authority. Pursuant to art. 6, sec. 6, par. 14 of the Georgia Constitution of 1976, the words "ordinary" and "court of ordinary" have been changed without notation to "judge of the probate court" and "probate court" throughout the text of this article. Section number designations have been retained for consistency with the original act.
               Pursuant to a consent decree entered March 8, 1993, by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia in civil action number 176-128, a redistricting and election plan was implemented which provided for two two-member districts and a chairman to be elected at large, thereby increasing the composition of the board of commissioners to five members. A copy of the subject consent decree is on file in the office of the clerk of the board of commissioners.
               Code reference—Board of commissioners, § 2-36 et seq.

               (1984 Ga. Laws, page 4521; 1987 Ga. Laws, page 4304; 1989 Ga. Laws, page 3897)

The enumeration of powers and duties hereinbefore made shall not be construed as a limitation of the powers of the board to such powers expressly enumerated. The board is hereby expressly given complete power, authority, and control relative to county matters of McDuffie County. 
               Section 11. - Monthly meetings.

                  Sec. 1-13. - General penalty. 
                  Unless another penalty is expressly provided, every person convicted of a violation of any provision of the Code or any ordinance, rule or regulation adopted or issued in pursuance thereof, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000.00 or 60 days imprisonment, or both.

                  (b)	Objections. At the appropriate time of the meeting, the chairman shall read all of the items on the consent agenda. If a commissioner objects to an item being on the consent agenda, the chairman shall move that particular item to the regular agenda. 
                  (c)	Approval. Following the reading of the consent agenda, the chairman will ask for unanimous approval of the items on the consent agenda. If there are no objections, all the items on the consent agenda will be adopted by unanimous consent.

                  Sec. 2-95. - Decorum. 
                  (a)	Standards. All commissioners must conduct themselves in a professional and respectful manner. All remarks should be directed to the chairman and not to individual commissioners, staff or citizens in attendance. Personal remarks are inappropriate. A commissioner is not allowed to speak at a meeting until he has been recognized by the chairman. All comments made by a commissioner shall address the motion that is being discussed. 
                  (b)	Enforcement. The chairman shall enforce these rules of decorum. If a commissioner believes that a rule has been broken, he can raise a point of order. A second is not required. The chairman can rule on the question or he can allow the board to debate the issue and decide the issue by majority vote. 
                  (Ord. of 8-4-93(1), § 1-11)

                  Sec. 2-97. - Public participation. 
                  Public participation in meetings of the board of commissioners shall be permitted in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
                  (1)	Public comments. The final agenda item of the meeting shall be reserved for comments from the public. All members of the public who wish to address the board must submit their name and the topic of their comments to the county clerk at least three business days before the board meeting. These individuals will be allotted five minutes to make their comments and their comments must be limited to their chosen topic. These limits can be waived by a majority vote of the board. 
                  (2)	Public participation on agenda items. By a majority vote, the board may allow public comment on an agenda item at the time the item is being considered by the board. These comments must be limited to the subject that is being debated. Members of the public may speak for five minutes and may only speak once. These limits can be waived by a majority vote of the board. Anyone wishing to speak at any board meeting must be recognized by the chairman before addressing the board. 
                  (3)	Decorum. Members of the public shall not make inappropriate or offensive comments at a board meeting and are expected to comply with the rules of decorum that are established for commissioners. Individuals who violate any rules of the board may be ruled out of order by the chairman or on a point of order made by a commissioner. A majority vote of the board will rule on the point of order. An individual who violates the rules of decorum may be removed from the meeting at the direction of the chairman. 
                  (4)	Public hearings. The board may schedule public hearings for the purpose of soliciting public comment on any subject of interest to the board.

No official action shall be taken at any such public hearing.

                  Sec. 2-98. - Amendments to rules of order. 
                  Any amendments to the rules of order must be submitted by a commissioner in writing to the county clerk three business days before a regular meeting of the board. The proposed amendment shall be included in the agenda for that meeting and distributed to all board members. All amendments require a majority vote of the board to be adopted. 
                  (Ord. of 8-4-93(1), § 1-14)
                  Sec. 2-99. - Suspending the rules of order. 
                  Rules of order may be suspended in the case of an emergency. A motion to suspend the rules requires a second, is debatable and requires a majority vote of the board. Rules governing quorum (section 2-86), voting methods and requirements (section 2-83 and section 2-84) and rules necessary for compliance with state law cannot be suspended.

                  Subdivision II. - Parliamentary Procedure 

                  Sec. 2-126. - Main motion. 
                  In order for the board to take any official action on any subject, a commissioner must propose a main motion. A proposed main motion will not be recognized by the chair until another commissioner agrees to second the motion. A second does not require the commissioner seconding the motion to support the motion. A commissioner may withdraw a main motion that he has made at any time before the board has voted on that motion. 
                  (Ord. of 8-4-93(1), § 2-01)
                  Sec. 2-127. - Debate. 
                  (a)	Management by chairman. After the main motion is recognized by the chair, the board shall debate the motion. The debate shall be managed by the chairman in a manner that is fair to all members of the board. Commissioners can participate in the debate only when they are recognized by the chairman. 
                  (b)	Subsidiary motions. During the course of debate, commissioners may introduce subsidiary motions that propose that the board take a particular action on a motion (section 2-130). There are two classes of subsidiary motions: debatable subsidiary motions and undebatable subsidiary motions. Debatable subsidiary motions consist of motions to postpone indefinitely, amend, refer to committee, and postpone to a time certain. Debatable subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. There are three undebatable subsidiary motions: limit debate, vote immediately, and lay on the table. They require a second and cannot be debated. 
                  (c)	Privileged motions. Commissioners may also introduce privileged motions (section 2-131). Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting and can be introduced during the course of debate. Privileged motions consist of a motion to raise a question of privilege and motions to recess and adjourn. The motions to recess and adjourn require a second. Debate is not allowed on privileged motions. 
                  (Ord. of 8-4-93(1), § 2-02)
                  Sec. 2-128. - Voting procedure. 
                  Voting on the debatable motions and voting on undebatable motions shall take place in accordance with the following provisions: 
                  (1)	Debatable motions. In the case of debatable motions, the vote can be proposed in one of two ways: (1) If debate has been completed and no other commissioner wishes to speak, the chair can call for the vote. If there are no objections, then the chair can proceed with the vote. (2) If the chairman calls for the vote and there is an objection, a member of the board may move to vote immediately ("move the previous question"). If this motion is seconded and approved by a majority vote, debate will stop. The chairman will then read the proposed motion to the board and ask for the votes of the commissioners. 
                  (2)	Undebatable motions. In case of undebatable motions, the vote shall occur immediately after the motion is recognized by the chair. The chairman shall read the proposed motion to the board and then call for the vote. 
                  (Ord. of 8-4-93(1), § 2-03)
                  Sec. 2-129. - Ranking of motions. 
                  (a)	Each subsidiary and privileged motion is assigned a specific rank. A motion of higher precedence can interrupt a motion of lower precedence. The higher motion must be decided before the board returns to consider the motion of lower precedence. 
                  (b)	A main motion has the lowest rank and does not take precedence over any other motion. A motion to adjourn has the highest rank and will take precedence over all other subsidiary and privileged motions. The order of precedence of motions shall be in accordance with this section. Motions at the bottom of the following list take precedence over motions at the top of the list. 
                  Lowest rank. 
                  (1)	Main motion.
                  Subsidiary motions (debatable): 
                  (2)	Postpone indefinitely.
                  (3)	Amend.
                  (4)	Refer to committee (commit).
                  (5)	Postpone to a time certain (postpone definitely).
                  Subsidiary motions (undebatable): 
                  (6)	Limit debate or extend limits.
                  (7)	Vote immediately (previous question).
                  (8)	Lay on the table (postpone temporarily).
                  Privileged motions (undebatable): 
                  (9)	Questions of privilege.
                  (10)	Recess.
                  Highest rank. 
                  (11)	Adjourn.

                  Sec. 2-130. - Subsidiary motions. 
                  During the course of debate, commissioners may introduce motions that propose that the board take a particular action on a main motion. These motions are called subsidiary motions, and they allow a board to reach a conclusion on the main motion. Subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. Three subsidiary motions, amend, limit debate and vote immediately, also can apply to other subsidiary motions. 
                  (1)	Postpone indefinitely. If a commissioner believes that the main motion should not be considered by the board, that commissioner may move to postpone the consideration of the main motions indefinitely. If the motion is successful, consideration of the main motion stops and the main motion is tabled. A motion to postpone indefinitely can be debated but it cannot be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (2)	Amend. If a commissioner believes that a main motion that is on the table should be changed in order to make it more acceptable, he can move to amend the motion. Amendments must be closely related to the original motion and must not change the nature of the motion that they amend. Motions to refer, amend, postpone to a time certain and the motion to recess can also be amended. A motion cannot be amended more than two times. Debate is allowed on a motion to amend only if the original motion is debatable. A majority vote is required for the board to adopt an amendment. If the amendment is adopted, then the board shall consider the amended version of the motion. 
                  (3)	Refer to a committee (commit). If a commissioner believes that further information is needed before the board can act on a main motion, he may propose that the motion be referred to a specific committee or department for further study. If an appropriate committee does not already exist, then a committee may be formed as a part of the motion. A motion to refer should specify the date that the committee or department will report back to the board. This motion is debatable and amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (4)	Postpone to a time certain (postpone definitely). A motion to postpone to a certain time may be proposed if a commissioner believes that the main motion should not be considered until a future time. This motion shall set a particular time for the main motion to be considered again. It is debatable and can be amended. If this motion is passed, the chairman will bring the original motion back to the board for consideration at the specified time. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (5)	Limit or extend limits of debate. A motion to limit debate places a time constraint on the length of debate. The details of such a motion are to be decided by the commissioner who makes the motion. This motion can also be used to extend the limits of debate if a limit on debate already exists. Debate is not allowed on this motion and a majority vote is required. 
                  (6)	Vote immediately (previous question). If a commissioner believes that the motion that is being considered should be voted on, the commissioner can move to vote immediately. The motion is undebatable and a vote of majority of the board is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (7)	Lay on the table (postpone temporarily). A motion to lay on the table proposes that the consideration of a main motion be postponed until a later time in the meeting. The motion can be brought up for consideration only if a motion to resume consideration is accepted by the board during the same meeting. The motion will die if it is not taken up during the meeting. Debate is not allowed on this motion and the motion is not amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (Ord. of 8-4-93(1), § 2-05)
                  Sec. 2-131. - Privileged motions. 
                  Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting. They do not address or relate to a main motion and can be introduced whether or not there is a main motion under consideration. Privileged motions take precedence over all subsidiary motions. Debate is not allowed on these motions. 
                  (1)	Question of privilege. A formal question addressed to the chair concerning the rights of a commissioner or of the board as a whole is referred to as a question of privilege. It does not require a second and cannot be debated or amended. The chair is required to make a ruling on the question. 
                  (2)	Recess. A motion to recess proposes that the meeting be suspended for a particular amount of time. The motion must specify the length of the recess. The motion must also be seconded. Debate is not allowed on this motion but the motion can be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (3)	Adjourn. In order for a meeting to come to a close, a commissioner must make a motion to adjourn. The motion to adjourn has the highest rank of any motion and as a result it can be introduced at any time. The motion requires a second, but is not debatable or amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (Ord. of 8-4-93(1), § 2-06)
                  Sec. 2-132. - Incidental motions. 
                  Incidental motions allow commissioners to exert their rights as a member of the board. Incidental motions can be introduced at any time during a meeting. 
                  (1)	Appeal. If a commissioner disagrees with a decision that is made by the chair, that commissioner may appeal the decision. If the appeal is seconded, the appeal will be considered by the board. The chair has the opportunity to explain the ruling that has been challenged. The board may then debate the appeal. The board shall decide by majority vote if the chair's decision is to be upheld or overturned. An appeal is high in precedence and can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or by a motion to lay on the table. 
                  (2)	Parliamentary inquiry. If a commissioner has a question about the rules of order, he may ask the chair to give an opinion on that question. This question should take the form of a parliamentary inquiry and should relate to the current business of the board. The motion takes precedence over all motions except privilege motions. This motion does not require a second and is not debatable or amendable. 
                  (3)	Point of order (question of order). If a commissioner believes that a violation of the rules of parliamentary procedure has occurred, he can raise a point of order. A second is not required. The chair can make a ruling on the question or can allow the board to debate and then rule on the question by majority vote. A point of order can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or a motion to lay on the table. 
                  (4)	Point of information (request for information). If a commissioner has a question about the facts of a particular issue that is being considered, he may ask a point of information. This motion is addressed first to the chair and then to the appropriate person. A second is not required and the motion is not debatable or amendable. 
                  (Ord. of 8-4-93(1), § 2-07)
                  Sec. 2-133. - Supplementary main motions. 
                  Three motions allow the board to act on a main motion that has either been passed or tabled by the board. These motions are considered to be main motions but differ from usual main motions in the ways specified. 
                  (1)	Reconsider. The motion to reconsider allows the board to debate whether or not to overturn a decision made at the meeting that is in progress. It allows the board to consider new information that may affect the decision that has already been made. Any commissioner can make a motion to reconsider and any commissioner may second the motion. The motion is debatable but it cannot be amended. A majority vote of the board is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to reconsider is passed, the original decision will be voided and the board will return to debate and revote the original motion. 
                  (2)	Rescind. A motion to rescind proposes that the board overturn a motion passed at a previous meeting. A motion to rescind can be made by any commissioner. It is in order as long as the original motion has not been implemented. An announcement of the intention to rescind a motion may be made at the meeting where the decision was made, or the commissioner seeking to rescind may place the matter on the agenda for the next meeting pursuant to section 2-91. The motion to rescind will then be placed on the agenda for the next meeting. At the next meeting, the motion to rescind will formally be made. If it is not seconded, then the board shall debate and vote on rescission. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to rescind is passed, the original decision will be voided. 
                  (3)	Resume consideration. The motion to resume consideration allows the board to consider a motion that has been temporarily postponed. This motion requires a second and is not debatable or amendable. It is a main motion but ranks higher than any debatable motion. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.

The licensee may cross-examine all witnesses offered by the county, and may call witnesses and present evidence on its own behalf. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings under this section although the board shall have the right to exclude evidence bearing on the lack of reliability. All testimony shall be offered under oath or affirmation. 
                  (5)	The board shall make its final determination not later than the date of its next regularly scheduled board meeting upon the completion of the hearing.

Progressive sanctions, depending on the severity of the violation are encouraged but not required. Where the remaining term of the license is less than 12 months, imposition of the suspension or probation for a period in excess of the term of the existing license shall be applied to any renewal license. A subsequent violation within a probationary period shall be cause for revocation and/or denial of a license renewal. A total of three separate and unrelated violations within 24 months, whether or not within a probationary period, shall be grounds for permanent revocation. 
                  (6)	The board's decision shall be personally served or mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the licensee, his/her attorney if attorney was present at the hearing, and a copy to the county's attorney if present at the hearing.

                  (7)	Upon receipt of notice of adverse action against the licensee under this section, the licensee may waive its right to a hearing and stipulate his/her preference to defer to a board sanction as recommended by the code enforcement officer. Any stipulation to defer to board sanction shall be in writing, signed by the licensee, and non-appealable.

Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)	A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)	Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)	The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)	The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections 38-84(c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)	The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)	Stripping of vegetation, regarding and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)	Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
                  (3)	Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)	Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
                  (5)	The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)	Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
                  (7)	Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)	Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)	To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)	Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)	Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
                  (12)	Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)	Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)	Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 34-84(b)(2) of this article; 
                  (15)	Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year-round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to Part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.	No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.	The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)	There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.	No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.	The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)	Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections 34-84(b) and (c) of this article. 
                  (e)	The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of, nor create a presumption of, a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. of 5-18-10, § IV)
                  Sec. 34-85. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)	General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)	Application requirements. 
                  (1)	No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of unincorporated McDuffie County without first obtaining a permit from the McDuffie County Planning Commission to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)	The application for a permit shall be submitted to the McDuffie County Planning Commission and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection 34-85(c) of this article. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsectiond 34-84(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by a minimum of five copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)	In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(5)(a), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)	Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 34-84(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection 34-85(b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)	If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)	The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)	Plan requirements. 
                  (1)	Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 34-84(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)	Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)	Permits. 
                  (1)	Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but, in any event, not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)	No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsections 34-84(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection 34-85(b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)	Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)	If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)	The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)	The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1).

                  Sec. 34-86. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)	The staff of the planning commission or assigned agent will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)	The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)	The planning commission staff or assigned agent shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)	No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)	The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)	The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  (a)	Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  (b)	Stop-work orders. 
                  (1)	For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  (2)	For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and 
                  (3)	All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  (4)	When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop-work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop-work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)	Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of subsection 34-85(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)	Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any City Charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article under county ordinances approved under this article shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

                  DIVISION 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 

                  Sec. 36-21. - Authorization. 
                  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Board of Commissioners of McDuffie County, Georgia does hereby ordain as follows: 
                  (Ord. of 8-4-10, Art. 1.A)
                  Sec. 36-22. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)	The flood hazard areas of McDuffie County, Georgia, are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)	These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. of 8-4-10, Art. 1.B)
                  Sec. 36-23. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)	Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)	Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; and 
                  (4)	Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)	Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  (Ord. of 8-4-10, Art. 1.C)
                  Sec. 36-24. - Objectives. 
                  The objectives of this article are: 
                  (1)	To protect human life and health;
                  (2)	To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)	To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)	To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
                  (5)	To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)	To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and
                  (7)	To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  DIVISION 4. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 36-91. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)	New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)	New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)	New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)	Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully-enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.	Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.	Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.	The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above the lowest interior grade or finished floor elevation; and 
                  3.	Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction. 
                  b.	So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this section, the unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.	The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)	All heating and air-conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
                  (6)	Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame-ties-to-ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
                  (7)	New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
                  (8)	New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
                  (9)	On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
                  (10)	Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
                  (Ord. of 8-4-10, Art. 4.A)
                  Sec. 36-92. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)	New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data is available or established, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 36-91(4), "elevated buildings". 
                  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)	Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30 1, AE 1, or AH 2 zones may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 36-73(6). 
                  1 A zones with BFEs. 
                  2 Shallow flood zones—BFEs may be indicated. 
                  (3)	Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data is available: 
                  a.	All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, such structure must have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.	Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.	The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
                  2.	The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches above the highest adjacent grade. 
                  c.	All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. subsection 26-91(6) above) 
                  d.	All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
                  1.	Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; and
                  2.	Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect-type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.	The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of division 4, subsections 36-92(3)a., c., above. 
                  (4)	Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 36-42 are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to floodwater velocity, debris, or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.	Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted, however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.	Only if subsection 36-92(4)a., above, is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 4.

                  Sec. 36-111. - Variance and appeal procedures. 
                  (a)	The McDuffie County Planning Commission Board as appointed by the board of commissioners shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
                  (b)	The planning commission board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, interpretation or determination is made by the director in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
                  (c)	Any person aggrieved by the decision of the planning commission board may appeal such decision to the board of commissioners; and thereafter to the Superior Court of McDuffie County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)	Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)	Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)	Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)	In reviewing such requests, the planning commission board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)	In the review and granting of a variance, the planning commission board shall consider the following: 
                  (1)	A variance shall be issued only when there is:
                  a.	A finding of good and sufficient cause;
                  b.	A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.	A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)	The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)	The director shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any approved variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)	Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the planning commission board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the start of construction of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  (6)	To protect critical and sensitive natural resources from degradation due to pollution and overdevelopment;

                  Sec. 44-3. - Standards governing the exercise of zoning powers. 
                  Georgia law requires each local government that adopts a zoning ordinance to specify the standards or factors that will be considered by the government when balancing public and private land development interests in zoning decisions. The following standards governing the exercise of the zoning power are adopted in accordance with O.C.G.A § 36-66-5(b): 
                  (1)	The existing land uses in the general area of the subject property and the zoning classification of nearby properties; 
                  (2)	The suitability of the proposed property use(s) as to the intent authorized by this chapter; 
                  (3)	The extent to which the value of the property in question would be diminished by the specific zoning requirements; 
                  (4)	The extent to which the diminution of private property value is necessary to promote the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the public; 
                  (5)	The extent to which the hardships imposed upon the individual property owner by the ordinance are balanced by the public benefits resulting from the applicable zoning requirements; 
                  (6)	The extent to which the property in question has a reasonable economic use as currently zoned; 
                  (7)	The length of time that the subject property has remained vacant as zoned in relation to the rate and intensity of development in the areas within the vicinity of the subject property; 
                  (8)	Whether the requested action will promote land uses that are generally compatible with the intensity and use of land development within the vicinity of the subject property;

                  (a)	Permitted land uses: Permitted land uses are specific types of land uses that are permitted by right within the applicable zoning district. The general classifications of permitted land uses are shown on the zoning map. The map also indicates where in the county each general and overlay zoning district is permitted. More specific guidance regarding the permitted land uses in each category are articulated in this article. 
                  (b)	Special exceptions: Special exceptions are land uses which are subject to the imposition of land use limiting conditions which modify the land use to make it more compatible with the principally permitted uses in one or more zoning districts, but may not be appropriate generally through out the applicable district(s), due to their nature, scale, and intensity of use. The planning commission shall have greater discretion to recommend (to the board of commissioners) restrictions on land uses permitted as special exceptions as is necessary to ensure compatibility with existing neighboring uses and potential future principally permitted land uses that may be developed in the area. Approval by the board of commissioners of a special exception application shall not constitute approval of any specific development plan. Examples of special exceptions for each zoning district are articulated in this article. 
                  Any development proposed must satisfy simultaneously the requirements of the underlying general zoning district and all applicable overlay zones, provided that the requirements of the special exception shall supersede all conflicting requirements of the underlying general zoning district and all other applicable overlay zones, unless otherwise specified within the special development standards in this article.

                  Sec. 44-36. - Platting required. 
                  In order to distinguish property uses; to support the intent of establishing zoning districts; and to facilitate the administration and enforcement of the requirements of this land development code, after the date of adoption of this chapter, the platting of any proposed development (including residential) or newly created lot(s) or parcel(s) shall be required. In addition, the placement/siting of any proposed structures on the proposed platted site shall be required.

                  Note—Any use not classified as a use permitted by right, an approved special exception, or, as an authorized nonconforming use shall be deemed incompatible and not permissible in accordance with this chapter. It is, however, recognized that the list of permitted and special exception uses listed within each zoning district is not comprehensive or complete. It is also recognized that the development code administrator may from time to time encounter a trade, business, or industry which is not specifically listed within any of the zoning districts, therefore, the development code administrator is authorized, after sufficient analysis and interpretation, to designate the appropriate zoning district into which the business or industry may appropriately be located.

                  Sec. 44-49. - O-1: Flood Hazard Overlay District. 
                  The Flood Hazard Overlay District is an overlay zone and may be combined with and/or superimposed upon any other district. The intent of the district is to set forth those standards necessary to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions including, but not necessarily limited to: securing safety from flood, to prevent loss of life, to prevent property damage and all other related dangers; to promote the public health and general welfare by regulating and restricting areas in the floodplains of watercourses in the unincorporated areas of the county which are subject to periodic flooding; and, to preserve the location, character and extent of natural drainage courses. The boundaries of this district shall coincide with the areas delineated on the Flood Hazard Boundaries Map of McDuffie County prepared by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, as amended. 
                  (1)	Uses permitted by right:

                  The Usry Pond Watershed Overlay District is an overlay zone and may be combined with and/or superimposed upon any other district. The intent of this district is to protect the county's potable fresh surface water supplies from the negative effects of drought, pollution, overdraft, or mismanagement. This protection is evidenced by the adoption of the Usry Pond Watershed Protection Ordinance by the board of commissioners on February 4, 1998 which shall hereby be incorporated into this zoning ordinance by reference. 
                  (1)	Uses permitted by right:

                  Sec. 44-52. - Treatment of overlay districts. 
                  An "overlay district" is a special zoning district that is superimposed over one or more general zoning districts to create an additional set of requirements that must be satisfied by all land development activities in order to protect certain special resources. McDuffie County has established overlay districts to protect special flood hazard areas, water supply watersheds, and lake recreational areas. The boundaries for each overlay zone are identified on the zoning map. Should a question arise as to the exact boundary of any overlay zone as shown on the zoning map, the development code administrator shall refer to the original source of the boundaries as specified in article III, section 44-33 for the applicable overlay zone. Amendments to the boundaries of any overlay zone shown on the zoning map shall be approved by the board of commissioners only where changes have been made to the areas contained in the official source, or to eliminate existing overlay districts or create new overlay districts, as the case may be. Where a conflict exists between the requirements of an overlay district and the requirements of a general zoning district, the requirements of the overlay district shall govern, unless otherwise specified within the special development standards.

                  Sec. 44-53. - District boundary determination guidelines. 
                  Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the aforesaid zoning districts as shown on the official zoning map, or land use classification as shown on the future land use map, the following rules shall apply: 
                  (1)	Unless otherwise indicated, the zoning district or land use boundaries are indicated as approximately following property lines, land lot lines, centerlines of streets, highways, alleys or railroads, shorelines of streams, reservoirs, or other bodies of water, or civil boundaries, and they shall be construed to follow such lines. 
                  (2)	Where zoning districts or land use boundaries are approximately parallel to the centerlines of streets, highways, or railroads, or right-of-way of the same, or the centerlines of streams, reservoirs, or other bodies of water, or said lines extended, such zoning district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance therefrom as indicated on the zoning map. If no distance is given, such dimensions shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the zoning map or future land use map. 
                  (3)	Where a zoning district or land use boundary line as appearing on the official zoning maps divides a lot which is under single ownership at the time of this enactment, the use classification of a larger portion may be extended to the remainder by the board of commissioners without recourse to amendment procedure. 
                  (4)	Where a public road, street or alley is officially vacated or abandoned, the regulations applicable to the property to which it is reverted shall apply to such vacated or abandoned road, street or alley. 
                  (5)	If the exact location of a boundary cannot be determined by the foregoing methods, the board of commissioners shall, upon formal written request, decide the location of the boundary.

                  Sec. 44-54. - Comprehensiveness of zoning districts. 
                  The purpose of this chapter is to place all portions of McDuffie County within specific zoning districts. Should any unincorporated area of the McDuffie County appear either by reference to the maps or by interpretation to be inadvertently or otherwise omitted from a zoning district, that area or areas are hereby placed in a R-1 Low Density Residential District and are subject to all the regulations pertaining thereto until such time as the board of commissioners can determine its proper zoning district classification. If, upon further consideration, the board of commissioners determines that area or areas should be reclassified, such change shall be accomplished through the appropriate amendment procedures specified in this chapter. 
                  (Ord. of 3-23-99, Art. III, § 10)
                  Sec. 44-55. - Speculative rezonings/reversion. 
                  McDuffie County discourages the use of rezonings as a strategy to increase speculative land value where the applicant has no immediate intent to develop in accordance with the rezoning. Rezonings are intended to grant the applicant an opportunity to exercise appropriate alternative development options in situations where development in compliance with existing zoning is not possible or practicable, as long as the proposed uses are consistent with the comprehensive plan and the character of the surrounding area. The granting of this privilege by the county carries with it the expectation that the proposed development will occur within a reasonable period of time. Therefore, when the board of commissioners grants approval of a rezoning, the applicant should acquire a construction permit or final plat approval (whichever is applicable) and commence construction activities in compliance with that permit or approval within one year of the date upon which the rezoning is approved. Reversion: If such actions have not been taken within one year, the planning commission may initiate actions to further rezone the subject property and/or to reinstate the original zoning classification.

                  The map entitled "McDuffie County, Georgia Future Land Use Map" prepared in 1992 and contained in the Joint McDuffie County, City of Thomson, City of Dearing Comprehensive Plan: 2015, as amended, together with all notations, references, and other information shown thereon is hereby made a part of this chapter, and may be referenced as the future land use map. Said future land use map is hereby made a public record and shall be kept permanently in the office of the development code administrator, where it will be accessible to the general public. Any uncertainty or confusion regarding the exact location of the land use classification boundaries shown on the future land use map shall be resolved in the manner prescribed in article III, section 44-53 of this chapter. 
                  (Ord. of 3-23-99, Art. IV, § 1)
                  Sec. 44-72. - Land use compatibility guidelines. 
                  McDuffie County is a rural community that is characterized by a broad mix of land uses. The county wishes to encourage continuation of this general development pattern. However, the county acknowledges that land uses can generate conflicts with neighboring uses, when significant differences in development intensity occur in close proximity. This chapter seeks to minimize potential development intensity conflicts through the use of quantitative performance standards. However, the county further seeks to minimize potential land use conflicts through the application of general land use compatibility guidelines. These guidelines shall be applied to all principally permitted land uses and those land uses permitted by special exception to identify the need for special development conditions over and beyond the protections provided by the required conditions, along with the development intensity and dimensional standards for the applicable zoning district. The board of commissioners shall have discretion to impose zoning conditions which are related to the promotion of the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare and designed to minimize the negative impact on surrounding lands. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, restrictions on land use, height, setbacks and other non-use requirements, physical improvements to the property and infrastructure serving the property. Where the development code administrator feels that, during administrative review, impact mitigation options specified in this section should be applied to a proposed use, the development code administrator may recommend to the planning commission board any mitigation requirements to be applied. Such recommendations by the planning commission board shall be forwarded to the board of commissioners where, upon review of the proposed mitigation requirements, they may change or alter the conditions of approval as they deem necessary to satisfy the intent of this section. 
                  (1)	Unmitigable land use conflicts. McDuffie County recognizes that some potential conflicts between land uses can be so extreme as to make any mitigation measures infeasible or overly burdensome on the development applicant. Such situations should be avoided. As a result, the following uses shall not be approved when the proposed development lot abuts a lot currently used or designated on the future land use map as appropriate for the stated protected use(s). 
                  a.	No heavy industry use shall be allowed on a lot that abuts an existing or planned residential development. 
                  b.	No solid waste facility shall be allowed on a lot that abuts an existing or proposed residential development. 
                  c.	No airport shall be allowed on a lot that abuts a lot committed to any residential or commercial development, or the I-2 Heavy Industrial District. 
                  (2)	Buffers. Buffers may be required where more intensive or concentrated land uses abut less intensive or concentrated land uses. Buffers shall be required for any proposed commercial or industrial use that abuts an existing or planned residential use. Buffers shall be required for any multifamily residential uses that abut an existing or planned single-family residential use. Buffers may be required for any residential development consisting of five or more lots or units that abuts a commercial farm operation or lands that are being cultivated to produce crops or fruits. Buffers also may be required for any development which possesses or abuts sensitive natural resources such as those specified in article V, section 44-83 of this chapter. Basic requirements for all buffers are specified in article V, section 44-87 of this chapter. The development code administrator or planning commission board, or the board of commissioners may require the applicant to install a solid fence at least six feet in height within a required buffer if necessary to provide protective screening. 
                  (3)	Hours of operation. Where a proposed business use will generate traffic levels that may be considered excessive in a predominantly residential area, the development code administrator, planning commission board, or the board of commissioners may limit the hours of operation of the business to prevent undue traffic noise impacts during the hours between 7:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. The planning commission may further impose restrictions on business operation during the weekends, especially for authorized uses by special exception. 
                  (4)	Glare. Some land uses, especially those providing lighted parking lots and lighted signs, can generate excessive glare on neighboring properties. The development code administrator or planning commission board, or the board of commissioners may impose special requirements for shielding or fencing (up to six feet in height) as is warranted to protect neighboring properties from excessive glare. 
                  (5)	Noise. Certain commercial and industrial uses can generate noises that may be considered excessive by neighboring uses. Noises can be irritating or conflicting in terms of pitch, frequency, volume, duration of exposure, random breaks between intervals of noise, or some combination of these factors. The development code administrator, planning commission board, or the board of commissioners may increase setback requirements up to three times the minimum required, or require sound walls or earth berms not to exceed eight feet in height as may be reasonable or necessary to minimize potential noise impacts beyond the property of the proposed noise-generating use. Such requirements shall not be applied to proposed agricultural uses. 
                  (6)	Traffic. When a newly developed land use generates substantial increases in traffic on an adjoining street, the resulting impacts on nearby single-family residential uses can be great. If reasonable concerns about traffic generation on the proposed property exist, the development code administrator, planning commission board, or the board of commissioners may require the applicant, at the applicant's own cost, to demonstrate through an appropriate and rational analysis using acceptable traffic engineering standards, that the proposed use would not significantly increase traffic congestion, or reduce traffic safety. If the proposed use would generate a total average weekday (or weekend for churches) daily traffic volume that would increase by 50 percent or more the average daily traffic volume on the adjoining street or streets (as estimated by the department of transportation for the current year) from which access to the property will be provided, then the development code administrator, planning commission board, or the board of commissioners may consider the following mitigation measures. 
                  a.	Developing a phasing schedule that would ensure that potential traffic volume increases would not cumulatively exceed 50 percent in any five-year period. 
                  b.	Providing access to the property from another neighboring street, thereby distributing potential traffic impacts to other streets. 
                  c.	Requiring smaller structures for nonresidential uses or reducing the total number of lots allowed to mitigate excessive traffic increases. 
                  (7)	Large paved areas. When a major commercial or industrial use requires a large paved parking lot (more than 100 parking spaces or one acre in area, whichever is less), the combined effect of impervious surfaces on stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge can be significant. In order to mitigate any such impacts to the natural environment, the development code administrator, planning commission, or the board of commissioners may require an applicant to provide unpaved vegetated islands or reserved strips to be integrated within the proposed parking area not to exceed 15 percent of the gross lot area covered by paved surfaces. 
                  (8)	Special studies. Where an unresolved dispute arises between an applicant and the development code administrator, the planning commission board, or the board of commissioners regarding the appropriateness or necessity of any impact mitigation measures contained in this section, a special study may be required to resolve the conflict and determine the appropriateness or necessity of the required impact mitigation measure. Such special study shall be prepared by a qualified consultant selected by agreement between the aforementioned local officials, as applicable, and the applicant. The cost for any needed study shall be borne solely by the applicant, unless special circumstances warrant discretion by the county whereby costs should be shared between the applicant and the county.

                  ARTICLE V. - GENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS 

                  Sec. 44-81. - Development intensity standards. 
                  Development intensity standards are established to determine an appropriate carrying capacity for a designated land use for all general zoning districts and overlay zones. Except where special development standards or planned development standards for certain land uses apply in article VI, these standards shall apply to principally permitted uses within their appropriate zoning district. 
                  (1)	Net density: 

                   
                  *Sewer required 
                  Note: All lot sizes indicated above shall be comprised of developable land. 

                   
                  **See definition of "dwelling unit." For clarity, a duplex has two dwelling units, therefore; in the R-1 district, two acres would be required. 
                  (2)	Minimum per unit heated floor area/square feet (residential uses only):

                   
                  *Note: Manufactured homes located in R-3 manufactured/mobile home parks are not regulated by size. 
                  (Ord. of 3-23-99, Art. V, § 1; Mo. of 5-18-99)
                  Sec. 44-82. - Basic dimensional standards. 
                  Basic dimensional standards are established to minimize the extent to which a development can impact neighboring properties. Several dimensional measures shall be applied in this section including impervious surface ratios (expressed as the percentage of a development site or lot which may contain impervious surfaces), and area requirements including restrictions of frontage, height, and a variety of setbacks. Basic dimensional standards are established for all general zoning districts and overlay zones. Except where natural resource development standards for certain land uses apply and, where special development standards or planned development standards for certain land uses apply in article VI and article VII respectively, these standards shall apply to both permitted uses and uses by special exception. All setback and frontage requirements shall be measured in feet from or along the applicable road right-of-way or property line, whichever is appropriate. 
                  (1)	Maximum impervious surface ratios (multiply ratio by gross lot area to calculate the maximum lot area that may be covered by impervious surfaces): 

                   
                  (2)	Minimum road frontage* 

                   
                  *Footage width along a publicly maintained right-of-way. 
                  Note: (flag lots) The planning commission may permit a reduction in minimum frontage to not less than 30 feet for flag lots fronting exclusively on a county road dead-end, or on a cul-de-sac in an interior residential subdivision. Flag lots shall otherwise be prohibited except in those two situations. 
                  Note: Crossover easements prohibited. To conform to the minimum requirements for road frontage referenced above, crossover easements shall be prohibited. (Also see article VII, section 44-139(c)) 
                  (3)	Minimum side and rear setback (principal structure in feet): 
                  (Buffers may supersede setbacks see section 44-87 of this article)

                   
                  Note: A 15-foot fire separation is required between all structures. 
                  (4)	Minimum side and rear setback (accessory structure in feet): 
                  (Buffers may supersede setbacks see section 44-87 of this article)

                   
                  *In these districts a five-foot side and rear setback is allowed for accessory structures under 400 square feet (cottage industries and home occupations excluded). 
                  (5)	Minimum front setback from centerline of road (all structures in feet): 

                   
                  (6)	Moving permit requirements manufactured homes. Effective upon the date of adoption of this chapter it shall be a violation of this chapter for any person(s), corporation, or entity to move or cause to be moved any manufactured home or industrialized building into or within McDuffie County without first having obtained a manufactured home moving permit from the office of the McDuffie County Planning Commission. Prior to the issuance of a moving permit, the mover shall show evidence of compliance with the provisions of Title 48, Chapter 5, Article 10 of the O.C.G.A. The planning commission office shall upon the payment of the permit fee, as set by the board of commissioners, issue to the permittee a transport decal to be affixed at all times to the manufactured home while it is being transported. 
                  (7)	Height requirements. No structure shall be constructed, reconstructed, or altered in any way that would cause it to exceed 35 feet in height as measured from the lowest ground elevation at the base of the structure to the tallest point of the structure. Exemptions and modifications to these requirements may be authorized by the development code administrator, planning commission, or the board of commissioners, however, exceptions shall only be made where, by reason of exceptional topographic condition or other extraordinary or exceptional conditions of a piece of property, the strict application of this requirement would result in practical difficulties to, or undue hardship on, the owner of the property, provided that relief may be granted without substantially impairing the intent and purpose of this chapter. 
                  Exemptions: 
                  a.	Churches and government buildings shall not be subject to the 35-foot height limit.
                  b.	The 35-foot height limit shall not apply to barns, silos, grain elevators, windmills, or other farm structures; belfries, cupolas, and domes; public monuments, water towers, antennas and transmission towers (including power line supports), chimneys, smokestacks, flag poles, masts, and aerials. 
                  (Ord. of 3-23-99, Art. V, § 2; Mo. of 5-18-99)
                  Sec. 44-83. - Natural resource development standards. 
                  (a)	Intent. The intent of this section is to set forth standards for the protection of important and sensitive natural resources in the unincorporated areas of McDuffie County for the purposes of maintaining the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to meet the goals, objectives and policies of the comprehensive plan. Protection and preservation of natural resources can provide unique public benefits for the community. These benefits include, but are not limited to: 1) the protection of sensitive habitats for fish, wildlife and endangered species; 2) prevention of nutrient exchange; 3) protection of surface water recharge areas; 4) protection of areas needed for scientific or educational research; 5) protection of public waters and recreational opportunities; and 6) promulgation of aesthetic enhancement and the protection of property values. These natural resource development standards have been established to feature requirements and/or incentives which are appropriate to providing the aforementioned public benefits, while at the same time reducing the overall negative impacts and public costs which may be imposed by manmade development. These natural resource development standards are applicable in all general zoning districts except where increased or different standards exists within this chapter, or where state or federal standards have jurisdiction or domain. 
                  (b)	Usry Pond Watershed Overlay District requirements. The purpose of establishing special requirements for the Usry Pond Water Supply Watershed is to protect the drinking water supplies for those jurisdictions within McDuffie County that provide public potable water. These protections are necessary for the enhancement of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as to assure that surface sources of drinking water are of high quality, thereby requiring minimal treatment to satisfy all state and federal drinking water standards. This protection is evidenced by the adoption of the Usry Pond Watershed Protection Ordinance by the board of commissioners on February 4, 1998 which shall hereby be incorporated into this zoning ordinance by reference and is found in Appendix A. 
                  (Ord. of 3-23-99, Art. V, § 3)
                  Sec. 44-84. - Public services and infrastructure development standards. 
                  (a)	Intent. The purpose of establishing development standards for public services and infrastructure in all general zoning districts is to assure that such services and infrastructure are available, and that they provide adequate capacity to offer a level of service consistent with community goals and objectives. 
                  (b)	Requirements for public water and sewer installation. Where public water and sewerage systems are available and reasonably accessible to a proposed development site, linkage to such systems is required. The following standards shall apply to subsequent types of development. 
                  (1)	All developments. Any development that must access and/or install public water and sewerage systems (see subsection (b)(2) below) shall be properly connected to those systems according to the standards of the applicable water and sewer authority. 
                  Capped/dry lines. If a public water system is to be provided by McDuffie County to an affected area by grant application or other means, the planning commission shall place a moratorium on any such developments in that area until such time as it has been confirmed that the grant or other funds have been approved or made available, and that the county will proceed with the utility installation. If approved but prior to actual installation by the county, the planning commission shall require the installation of capped or dry lines in the proposed development. If the grant application or other funds are denied or if the county does not proceed with the intended installation, the development shall be allowed to install on-site water and sewer disposal systems as required in article VI, section 44-109. 
                  (2)	Residential developments. All new residential developments shall be connected to an existing public water system, and where available, a public sewer system if service is available within the following distances, and if the intervening topography does not make service infeasible: 

                   
                  *Where a tap-on and lateral line will access the utilities to the lot or residence. Extension of water main not applicable. 
                  (3)	Commercial and public/institutional developments. All commercial and public/institutional developments within 1,000 feet to the existing public water or sewer system shall be connected. 
                  (4)	Industrial developments. All heavy industrial developments must access water and sewer facilities. All light industrial developments over 3,000 square feet of gross floor area and located within one-half mile of existing public water and sewer shall be connected. 
                  (5)	Planned or mixed use development. All planned unit developments or mixed use developments within one-half mile to existing public water or sewer system shall be connected, or appropriate on-site or community type service shall be provided. Residential subdivisions (planned developments) shall comply with subsection (b)(2) above. 
                  (c)	Private systems prohibited. The installation of private water and sewer systems (serving more than one household) shall be prohibited. However, the use of a single water well to supply water to up to three related households may be permitted upon review and approval from the planning commission and the McDuffie County Health Department. 
                  (Ord. of 3-23-99, Art. V, § 4)
                  Sec. 44-85. - Parking and access requirements. 
                  (a)	Intent. The purpose of parking and access requirements is to prevent parking problems and other traffic related nuisances, and to improve traffic circulation and safety for each zoning district. This subsection shall provide standards, requirements and incentives for adequate, safe, and convenient off-street parking and access only in all general zoning districts. 
                  (b)	Requirements. The following requirements shall apply to off-street parking and access for both residential and nonresidential developments and shall be further distinguished by the number and size of spaces, relationship of the parking area to the building it serves, and parking lot design. 
                  (1)	Parking space requirements. An adequate number of off-street parking shall be required in all developments to accommodate residents and/or visitors. Off-street parking shall be required for various land uses as follows. On-street or right-of-way parking is prohibited. 
                  a.	Residential uses:

                   
                  b.	All other uses:
                  1.	Transient dwellings:

                   
                  2.	Health facilities:

                   
                  3.	Public assembly:

                   
                  4.	Businesses:

                   
                  5.	Industries:

                   
                  (2)	Parking lot design standards. Parking lots should be designed to adequately and economically service the facilities that they serve, while at the same time being conscious of the environmental impacts that poor design can cause. McDuffie County recognizes that the design of parking lots varies. However, the following standards are intended to balance the effectiveness of parking lot design with the community goals. 
                  a.	Entrances and exits should be designed to provide adequate and effective circulation, and shall not impede the flow of traffic, or cause traffic congestion or traffic hazards. 
                  b.	There should be sufficient maneuvering room for vehicles to enter and leave the lot and individual spaces without endangering themselves, vehicles traveling in the roadway system, or pedestrians. 
                  c.	Parking bays or stalls shall be no less than 180 square feet. All parking bay designs and stall dimensions shall be approved by the development code administrator. 
                  d.	Where it is determined that substantial traffic congestion or conflict would occur within or proximate to a proposed development access from collector or arterial streets to a parking lot may not be permitted unless an access drive is installed. 
                  e.	Where large paved lots or parking areas are proposed, the requirements in article IV, section 44-72(7) may apply. 
                  f.	The site plan shall provide for adequate drainage and shall minimize erosion.
                  (3)	Emergency vehicle access. The planning commission may require the applicant to designate separate special emergency vehicle access lanes in appropriation locations as is deemed necessary to provide for emergency vehicle access. Where required, emergency vehicle access lanes shall be located as close as possible to the main entrance of the principal structures of the property, shall be at least 15 feet in width, and shall be visibly designated for exclusive emergency use, either by painting, appropriate signage, or both. 
                  (Ord. of 3-23-99, Art. V, § 5)
                  Sec. 44-86. - Common open space requirements. 
                  Within developments where open or common space is required or where such space is provided by an applicant, the following conditions shall apply: 
                  (1)	Location of open space. Open space should be distributed evenly throughout the development so that all residents of the development have easy access to such areas. 
                  (2)	"Open space" defined. At least 50 percent of all required common open space shall be developable land area. Common open space shall not include public or private streets, driveways, private yards, or patios, parking areas, or utility easements where the land cannot be used appropriately for active or passive recreation. 
                  (3)	Management agreement for control and maintenance of common areas. No lot or structure in a development containing common or shared open space shall be sold until a corporation, association, property owner's group or similar entity has been formed with the right to assess all the properties which are jointly owned with interests in the common areas and facilities in the entire development or in the tract which is a part of the entire development to meet the expense of such entity, and with authority to control, and the duty to regularly maintain all of said mutually available features of the development or tract portion thereof. In addition, the homeowner's association bylaws or rules shall contain provisions authorizing the local government to maintain said open space at the association's expense and upon 15 days advance written notice, if the association has not properly maintained any or all open space entrusted to it. Such entity shall operate under recorded conditions, covenants and restrictions which may include compulsory memberships of all owners of lots and/or dwelling units, and flexibility of assessments to meet the changing costs of maintenance, repairs, and services. The developer shall submit evidence of compliance with the requirement to the planning commission. This condition shall not apply to land dedicated to the county for public purposes. 
                  (Ord. of 3-23-99, Art. V, § 6)
                  Sec. 44-87. - Buffer standards. 
                  Every development with the exception of single-family residential shall provide sufficient buffering if existing barriers do not provide reasonable screening. Buffers may be imposed by the board of commissioners. Buffers may also be required for any development by the development code administrator, or planning commission (board) when it has been determined that there is a need: (1) to shield neighboring properties from any adverse external effects of a proposed development, or (2) to shield the proposed development from negative impacts of neighboring uses, such as streets or railroads. Buffers between land uses shall be measured from side and rear property lines, excluding any driveways or internal streets. All buffers shall comply with the following criteria: 
                  (1)	Buffers shall be designed to provide yearround visual screen in order to minimize adverse visual and noise impacts. Acceptable buffers may include earth berms, natural vegetation, wooden or stone fences, or any combination of the aforementioned screening materials. The erection of structures within designated buffer strips shall be prohibited, except for signs, lighting, and utility lines as provided below. 
                  (2)	When any proposed commercial or industrial development abuts an existing or planned residential use; or where proposed commercial or industrial development abut lands used for commercial farming; a vegetated buffer strip of at least 100 feet wide shall be provided along the length of the property line which abuts the farm lands or residential areas. 
                  (3)	Where any other use, excluding residential development, is proposed on land adjacent to land used for commercial farming, a vegetated buffer strip of at least 75 feet wide shall be provided by the proposed development along the length of the property line which abuts the farm lands. 
                  (4)	Where more intensive or concentrated land uses abut less intensive land uses, except as provided above, a buffer strip of at least 50 feet wide shall be provided by the proposed development along the length of the common property line. 
                  (5)	Where a proposed development abuts a street which, according to its functional classification, is designated as a collector, a landscaped buffer strip at least 15 feet wide shall be provided along the property line abutting the road; when designated as an arterial, a landscaped buffer strip at least 20 feet wide shall be provided along the property line abutting the road. Where entrances to the development cross a required road buffer, a single nonilluminated sign may be permitted by the planning commission or board of adjustment. With the exception of visual screens, utility lines, and streetlights (where alternative siting is not possible), no other construction within street buffers may be permitted. 
                  (6)	Where wooden, brick, or stone fencing is used as a visual screen within a buffer, the height of the wall shall not exceed six feet. In addition, natural vegetation, such as flowers, hedges, or dwarf evergreen trees shall be included at regular intervals to soften the appearance of the fence.

                  ARTICLE VI. - SPECIAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS 

                  Sec. 44-101. - Regional shopping centers. 
                  (a)	Intent. McDuffie County recognizes that, as the county continues to grow and prosper, the need for and marketability of regional shopping centers designed to serve the retail shopping needs of a regional population (within and beyond McDuffie County) will increase. However, the county also recognizes that such facilities, by virtue of their size and nature, can generate significant impacts on established commercial centers, local growth rates and the distribution of growth in the county, traffic patterns and congestion, public facilities, and sensitive natural resources. Many of the impacts generated by regional shopping centers can be positive, negative, or both. McDuffie County seeks to minimize the negative impacts and maximize the positive impacts by developing standards to manage the county's transition to a regional commercial center in a way that is compatible with the community's ability to absorb the impacts, while not impeding the inevitability of that trend. To implement this impact management scheme, McDuffie County has created special standards to place general guidelines on the design and potential location of regional shopping centers. These guidelines are designed to prevent excess development speculation and competition for the development of regional shopping centers, which could result in market saturation, destabilization of established commercial centers or areas, rapid fluctuations in local property values, and excessive demand on existing public facilities. 
                  (b)	Required conditions. A regional shopping center is a use permitted by special exception in the C-2 General Commercial District, and in the T-1 Interstate Village District. An applicant shall request an amendment to the zoning map for the appropriate district designation for a property that satisfies the following requirements. The planning commission and board of commissioners shall consider these requirements in addition to the criteria listed in article I, section 44-3 when evaluating a request for an amendment to the zoning map to apply the special exception in the appropriate district. 
                  (1)	The lot should be designated on the future land use map for commercial use.
                  (2)	The lot must be at least 30 acres in size and must contain an additional 3,750 square feet of land area for each proposed additional 1,000 square feet of net floor area over and above the first 350,000 net square feet. At least 80 percent of the proposed lot gross land area shall consist of developable land area. 
                  (3)	The lot must have at least 300 feet of frontage on any arterial highway or a major collector highway. 
                  (4)	The lot must have direct access to public water and sewer.
                  (5)	The neighboring areas within 0.5 mile of the lot should be characterized primarily by established high volume vehicular traffic commercial land uses that would be complementary to a regional shopping center. Such commercial uses include, but are not limited to, supermarkets, gas stations, automobile repair shops, movie cinemas, restaurants, department stores, hardware or building supply stores, and banks. 
                  (6)	No portion of a lot approved for development of a regional shopping center shall be located within the boundaries of the Usry Pond Watershed Overlay District. 
                  (c)	Application and review procedures. Once the board of commissioners has approved an amendment to the zoning map to apply the regional shopping center special exception to a lot, the owner or his/her duly authorized agent shall submit a development application for approval by the planning commission. The application must be approved by the planning commission within one year of the date of approval of the amendment to the zoning map by the board of commissioners or the planning commission may initiate further rezoning of the regional shopping center property. 
                  (d)	Special development standards. The following special development standards shall apply to all proposed regional shopping centers in addition to the applicable requirements of the general zoning district and overlay zone(s). 
                  (1)	All areas of the proposed development site that do not satisfy the definition of developable land area shall be designated as "open space," which must be retained and maintained in a natural vegetated state. The planning commission may allow the applicant to improve a portion of the designated open space to provide a park or passive recreational uses, such as a walking trail, garden area, or fenced playground, provided the proposed improvements satisfy the following requirements: 
                  a.	The proposed recreational improvements will not affect more than 50 percent of the designated open space areas; 
                  b.	No improvements will be made to lands that are classified as wetlands without written approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; and 
                  c.	Public use of the improved recreational areas will not cause undue environmental stress on the remaining open space areas. 
                  (2)	The development will contain adequate stormwater management facilities to comply with the McDuffie County Stormwater Ordinance. The planning commission may request technical assistance in evaluating the applicant's proposed measures to comply with this requirement. Any costs associated with this evaluation assistance shall be paid by the applicant. All drainage improvements shall tie into any available drainageways along the adjoining public streets. 
                  (3)	The development shall have at least two entrances from a public street that are at least 200 feet apart (as measured from accessway centerline to accessway centerline along the intersecting street line). The planning commission may require additional accessways not to exceed two as it deems necessary to accommodate safe entrance, egress, and emergency access to the development. 
                  (4)	A 100-foot wide vegetative buffer shall be provided along all property lines that adjoin an existing residential or agricultural lot.

                  Sec. 44-102. - Manufactured home parks. 
                  (a)	Intent. In order to provide manufactured home park developers with maximum siting flexibility and to provide the county with reasonable latitude to ensure consistency of a proposed manufactured home park with the spirit and intent of this chapter, McDuffie County has created conditions for a special exception in the R-3 General Zoning District in order to place general guidelines on the design and potential location of manufactured home parks. 
                  (b)	Application and review procedures. Manufactured home parks is a use permitted by special exception only in an R-3 High Density Residential Zoning District.

At such time as the development code administrator shall approve the preliminary design, a preliminary plat shall then be forwarded to the planning commission (board) for its review. In addition to its review of the plat, the planning commission (board) shall convene a hearing as prescribed by this chapter to consider the applicant's request for a change in zoning. The results of the plat review and request for a zoning change shall thereafter be forwarded to the board of commissioners for final consideration. In reviewing the preliminary design and plat the development code administrator and the planning commission (board) shall consider any mitigating factors, and, any development criteria including, but not limited to, the following: 
                  (1)	The minimum lot area for a manufactured home park shall be ten acres, but not more than 100 acres, at least 80 percent of which shall consist of developable land area.

                  (2)	Principal or accessory use. Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or accessory uses. An existing tower structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot. For the purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with district development regulations the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas to towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots. 
                  (3)	Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for an antenna and/or tower shall provide to the planning commission an inventory of its existing towers, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower. The planning commission may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals or special exception permits under this chapter or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the governing authority. 
                  (4)	Aesthetics and lighting. The guidelines set forth in this section shall govern the location of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this section, provided that the governing authority may waive these requirements if it determines that the goals of this chapter are better served thereby. 
                  a.	Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted sky blue, gray, or foliage green or such color as is specified by the planning commission, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  b.	At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
                  c.	If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
                  d.	Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the governing authority may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. 
                  (5)	Federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this section shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations. Failure to do so shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. 
                  (6)	Building codes and safety standards. To ensure the aesthetic appearance and structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is properly maintained and, in regard to its structural integrity, it shall be maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the governing authority inspection department concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the downer of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said 30 days, the governing authority may remove such tower at the owner's expense. 
                  (c)	Permitted uses. 
                  (1)	General. The uses listed in this section are deemed to be permitted uses and shall not require administrative review or a special exception application. Nevertheless, all such uses shall comply with subsections 44-104(b)(4), (5), and (6) above and all other applicable ordinances, and prior to the installation of any antenna or tower pursuant to this section, the owner of such antenna or tower shall send written notice to the planning commission, which notice shall include the location, size, and configuration of such antenna or tower. 
                  (2)	Uses permitted by right. The following uses are specifically permitted: 
                  a.	Locating a tower or antenna, including the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with said tower or antenna, in any industrial or commercial zoning district; provided, however, that such tower shall be set back from any existing off-site residential structure a distance equal to the height of the tower; 
                  b.	Installing an antenna on an existing structure such as an existing tower, building, sign, light pole, water tower, or other freestanding nonresidential structure that is 50 feet in height or greater, so long as said additional antenna adds no more than 20 feet to the height of said existing structure. 
                  (d)	Administrative approvals. 
                  (1)	General.
                  a.	The development code administrator (DCA) may administratively approve the uses listed in subsection (d)(2) of this section. 
                  b.	Each applicant for administrative approval shall apply to the planning commission, providing the information set forth in subsections (e)(2) and (4) of this section. 
                  c.	The development code administrator (DCA) shall unless due to specific causes of a delay, respond to each such application within 30 days after receiving it by either approving or denying the application. If the DCA fails to respond to the applicant within said 30 days, the application shall be deemed to be approved. 
                  d.	In connection with any such administrative approval, the DCA may, in order to encourage shared use, administratively reduce any district setback requirements by up to 50 percent. 
                  (2)	Specific administratively approved uses. The following uses may be approved by the development code administrator (DCA) after conducting an administrative review: 
                  a.	Installing an antenna on an existing structure such as an existing tower, building, sign, light pole, water tower, or other freestanding nonresidential structure) that is less than 50 feet in height, so long as said additional antenna adds no more than 20 feet to the height of said existing structure; 
                  b.	Locating any alternative tower structure in a zoning district other than industrial or commercial than in the judgment of the DCA is in conformity with the goals set forth in section 44-104(b)(1) of this chapter; 
                  c.	Locating any tower structure in a zoning district other than industrial or commercial that a Georgia licensed professional engineer certifies can accommodate the ultimate number of shared users proposed by the applicant, and that the DCA concludes is in conformity with the goals set forth in section 44-104(b)(1) and the requirements of this section, and that meets the following height and usage criteria: 
                  1.	For a single user, up to 90 feet in height,
                  2.	For two users, up to 120 feet in height, and
                  3.	For three or more users, up to 150 feet in height.
                  (e)	Special exception uses. 
                  (1)	General. The following provisions shall govern the issuance of special exception uses: 
                  a.	If a tower or antenna is not a permitted use under subsection (c)(2) of this section, then a special exception review shall be required for the construction of a tower or the placement of an antenna in all zoning districts. 
                  b.	In recommending a special exception use, the planning commission board may impose conditions to the extent the board concludes such conditions are necessary to minimize any adverse effect of the proposed tower on adjoining properties. 
                  c.	Any information of an engineering nature that the applicant submits, whether civil, mechanical, or electrical shall be certified by a licensed Georgia professional engineer. 
                  (2)	Site plan. Each applicant requesting a special exception use under this section shall submit a scaled site plan and a scaled elevation view and other supporting drawings, calculations, and other documentation, signed and sealed by a licensed Georgia professional engineer or surveyor showing the location and dimensions of all improvements, including information concerning topography, tower height requirements, setbacks, drives, parking, fencing, landscaping, adjacent uses, and other information necessary to assess compliance with this chapter. 
                  (3)	Factors considered in granting special exception uses. The planning commission board shall consider the following factors in determining whether to issue a special use permit: 
                  a.	Height of the proposed tower,
                  b.	Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential district boundaries,
                  c.	Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties,
                  d.	Surrounding topography,
                  e.	Surrounding tree coverage and foliage,
                  f.	Design of the tower, with particular reference to the design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or elimination visual obtrusiveness, and 
                  g.	Availability of suitable existing towers and other structures as discussed in subsection (e)(4) below. 
                  (4)	Availability of suitable existing towers or other structures. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the governing authority that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing owner or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may consist of any of the following: 
                  a.	No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet the applicant's engineering requirements. 
                  b.	Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements. 
                  c.	Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment. 
                  d.	The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
                  e.	The fees or costs required to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed unreasonable. 
                  f.	Property owners or owners of existing towers or structures are unwilling to accommodate reasonably the applicant's needs. 
                  g.	The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
                  (5)	Security fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device, provided however, that the governing authority may (in its sole discretion) waive such requirements, as it deems appropriate. 
                  (6)	Landscaping. The following guidelines shall govern the landscaping surrounding towers for which a special exception use is required; provided however, that the governing authority may (in its sole discretion) waive such requirements if the goals of the section 44-105 would be better served. 
                  a.	Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from adjacent residential property. 
                  b.	In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived altogether. 
                  c.	Existing natural tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter may be a sufficient buffer. 
                  (f)	Removal of abandoned antennas and towers. Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove same within 90 days of receipt of notice from the governing authority notifying the owner of such abandonment. If such antenna or tower is not removed within said time period, the governing authority may remove such antenna or tower at the owner's expense. If there are two or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the tower.

                  (Ord. of 3-23-99, Art. VI, § 8)
                  Sec. 44-109. - On-site water and sewer requirements. 
                  All proposed on-site water and sewage disposal systems shall be approved by the McDuffie County Health Department and shall meet minimum requirements set by the State of Georgia prior to issuance of an occupancy permit by the development code administrator. As referenced by article V, section 44-84(c); private water and sewer systems are prohibited. 
                  (Ord. of 3-23-99, Art. VI, § 9)
                  Sec. 44-110. - Signs. 
                  (a)	Purpose and intent. It is the purpose of the McDuffie County Board of Commissioners in enacting this section to provide standards to safeguard life, public health, property and welfare by regulating the location, size, illumination, erection, maintenance and quality of materials of all signs. More specifically, signs have a powerful impact on the aesthetic environment of the community, and it is the purpose of this section to encourage an aesthetically attractive environment, while allowing sufficient opportunities for communications to serve business and comply with the federal and state constitutions and laws. Signs create visual clutter and therefore should be regulated in their size, location, construction and illumination. Signs can detract from the beauty of the neighborhood and lower property values. In seeking to comply with federal and state law, the board has determined the following: large billboards are, as the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized, an aesthetic harm; the [State of] Georgia Supreme Court has upheld sign regulations on the basis of aesthetics and preserving the beauty of environment; and, the Eleventh Circuit has recognized portable signs are visual clutter and a potential traffic hazard. The holdings show that the county's ordinance is within the law and therefore constitutional, which is a goal of the county. 
                  Many signs can also be a hazard and negatively impact traffic safety, by distracting drivers and blocking views of other vehicles and dangers, by making intersections more treacherous, and by making it difficult to see oncoming traffic when entering a roadway. Therefore, it is also the purpose of this section to prevent those harms by regulating signs to safe locations, safe sizes, with proper and safe illumination and construction.

The enforcement personnel or any other agent of McDuffie County having jurisdiction under the circumstances may, upon passage of these sign regulations, remove or direct the removal of any sign in violation of this section, without giving notice to any party, if: 
                  a.	Said sign is upon the public right-of-way or upon other public property.

If removed by the county as referenced in this section, and for the purposes of collecting any and all reimbursable cost to the county for such removal; if payment, or satisfactory arrangements to make payment is not made by the property owner, sign erector, or owner within 30 days after the receipt of said statement, the enforcement personnel shall certify the amount thereof for collection to the county attorney.

Signs which do not comply with this section and were legally placed before the effective date of this section shall become non-conforming with respect to the requirements set forth herein; however, signs which were illegally erected, established or maintained with respect to the applicable requirements of prior ordinances shall be removed or brought into compliance herewith. Non-conforming signs made of paper, cloth or other non-durable material, all temporary signs other than those permitted therein, and any signs that are not affixed to a building or the ground, or are located within a public right-of-way, may be removed.

Those signs considered grandfathered upon the passage of zoning shall be governed by the signage requirements for the zoning classification, as designated by the DCA, which most closely approximates its use. [For example, Russell's Bait store on the Washington Road, although a grandfathered commercial use located in a residentially zoned district, for signage purposes, would be considered as Commercial and would therefore have to conform to the signage requirements of a Commercial district for sign limitation purposes.] 
                  c.	Minor repairs and maintenance of non-conforming signs such as repainting, electrical repairs and neon tubing may be permitted. However, no structural repairs or changes in the size or shape of the sign shall be permitted except to make the sign comply with the requirements of the Section.

                  (Ord. of 12-18-01, Art. VI, § 10(10.1—10.12))
                  Editor's note— Ord. of Dec. 18, 2001, Art. VI, § 10, repealed § 44-110, in its entirety and enacted new provisions to read as herein set out. Prior to amendment, § 44-110 pertained to signage and derived from Ord. of March 23, 1999, Art. VI, § 10. 
                  Sec. 44-111. - Adult entertainment establishment regulations. 
                  (a)	(1)	Purpose. The purpose of this section is to regulate certain types of businesses including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments as defined herein, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses and the adverse affect on property values and on the public health, safety, and welfare of the county, and on its citizens and property, and on the character and preservation of its neighborhoods and development will be curtailed. This section is not intended as a defacto prohibition of legally protected forms of expression. This section is intended to represent a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods and development through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus any legally protected fights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons. This section is not intended to allow or license any business, establishment, or activity which would otherwise be unlawful. 
                  (2)	Findings. Based on the experience of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta, Georgia; Fulton County, Georgia; Dekalb County, Georgia; Richmond County, Georgia; Floyd County, Georgia; Amarillo, Texas; Austin, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Houston, Texas; Renton, Washington; Phoeniz, Arizona; Augusta, Georgia; LaGrange, Georgia; Dalton, Georgia; Whitfield County, Georgia; Carrollton, Georgia; Smyrna, Georgia; Rome, Georgia; Bartow County, Georgia; and Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida, which experiences are believed to be relevant to the problems faced by McDuffie County, Georgia, the McDuffie County Board of Commissioners takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the findings of the commissioners that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore the limitation of nude conduct in establishments licensed in the unincorporated limits of the county and prohibiting the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in said establishment is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity. Based on these findings, this section is adopted to regulate certain types of businesses and to establish where such activity may or may not be conducted.

                  a.	To review applications for changes to zoning classifications (i.e., zoning changes), to hear after prescribed public notice, public testimony regarding the proposed changes; to review the current comprehensive plan and future land use map, as applicable; to consider the effect of the proposal upon the public welfare; and to render a written recommendation to the board of commissioners regarding proposed amendments to the comprehensive plan, land development code, official zoning map, or other amendments to these regulations. 
                  b.	To review proposed land use compatibility measures recommended by the development code administrator during administrative review to mitigate potential impacts between proposed and existing land uses. The planning commission may affirm or modify the recommended land use compatibility mitigation measures as is necessary to advance the objectives of this chapter. 
                  c.	To hear and decide special exceptions to the requirements of these regulations which the planning commission board shall recommend to the board of commissioners in accordance with these regulations. In granting a special exception or modification, the board of commissioners should determine that: 
                  1.	The use meets or exceeds all required conditions.
                  2.	The use is not detrimental to the public health or general welfare.
                  3.	The use is appropriately located with respect to transportation facilities, water supply, fire and police protection, waste disposal, and similar services.

                  1.	There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions that are peculiar to the particular property in question because of its size, shape, or topography. 
                  2.	The application of these regulations to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship that is inconsistent with the spirit and intent of this chapter. 
                  3.	Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purpose and intent of these regulations. 
                  4.	The requested relief is necessary to ensure that the property owner is entitled to the same basic development rights and privileges as other similarly zoned properties and does not grant the applicant special rights and privileges to which other similarly zoned property owners are not also entitled. 
                  5.	The proposed relief will grant the minimum deviation from the requirements of this chapter that is necessary to mitigate the hardship. 
                  6.	Mere inconvenience to the property owner shall not constitute justification for the granting of an application, nor shall the number or proponents or opponents in itself be a singular factor in the granting or denying an application. 
                  (3)	Procedural rules. The procedural rules for the planning commission (board) shall be as follows: 
                  a.	Meetings.

                  Sec. 44-166. - Final plat and/or plan recording procedures (platting requirements). 
                  The purpose of providing for plat and planned development recording procedures is to ensure that the platting and recording of official lots of record and planned unit developments are promulgated according to community standards and the standards of this chapter. Such standards shall provide required lots of adequate size, configuration, and appropriate design for the intended use. Such standards also shall allow for design flexibility and creativity, and shall in the case of planned developments provide for street and utility systems of adequate capacity. 
                  (1)	Plat/plan approval authority. The planning commission shall be the official platting authority. 
                  a.	Platting required. After the date of adoption of this chapter, platting shall be required for the establishment of any lot, parcel, tract, or any new residential, commercial, or industrial site, and, in addition, any person proposing to divide or subdivide land shall submit to the planning commission any plats and plans of any proposed division, subdivision, or planned development which shall conform to any division, subdivision, or planned development requirements set forth in this chapter. Any intended structures proposed to be sited on any platted site shall be sited on same.

No clearing or grading of any purposed (proposed) streets shall begin prior to approval of a subdivision plat or plan by the planning commission as certified thereon. This prohibition shall extend to any other improvement related to the development of the proposed subdivision or planned development. 
                  c.	Development plans approval required prior to construction of improvements. No subdivision or planned development improvement shall commence prior to the approval of development plans by the planning commission.

No land owner shall sell or otherwise convey any lot or combination of lots for any purpose whether a single lot or lots in a proposed subdivision or planned development by reference to or exhibition of or by any other use of plat, plan, or such subdivision, until such plat or plan has been given final approval by the planning commission, as certified thereon, and recorded in the office of the clerk of the superior court of McDuffie County. 
                  e.	Submission of "as-built" plans prior to final acceptance by governing body. Final acceptance of improvements in any subdivision or development which vary substantially from approved development plans shall not be given by the planning commission prior to the submission and approval of "as-built" plans and any other technical information which may be required. 
                  f.	Legal status of public street required. No land dedicated as a public street shall be accepted, opened, or improved, nor shall any utilities or other facilities be installed therein unless such street corresponds in its location and lines with a street shown on a plat approved by the planning commission. Streets which shall have been accepted or opened as, or otherwise shall have received the legal status of a public street prior to the adoption of these regulations may be improved, or utilities or other facilities may be installed therein. The governing body, however, may locate and construct or may accept any other street, if the resolution or other measure for such approval is first submitted to the planning commission for its review and comment. 
                  g.	Access to public street required. No building permit shall be issued for and no building or other structure shall be erected on any lot unless such lot has access to a street which shall have been accepted, maintained, or opened, or otherwise shall have received the legal status of, a public street; provided, however, that private streets and other drive accessways may be approved (but not accepted by the county) under the terms of these rules and regulations in planned developments, condominium projects, apartment projects, townhouses, commercial developments, shopping centers, or other developments where it is established that the owner/developer shall maintain ownership and control over such streets, roads, and other improvements. 
                  (2)	Recording of final plat/plan. Upon the approval of a final plat or plan by the planning commission board or development code administrator, the owner, or his agent, shall have the final plat or plan recorded in the office of the clerk of the superior court for the sale of any lot, or lots in a planned development. 
                  No plat shall be changed or modified prior to recording once approval has been received from the planning commission board or development code administrator. 
                  a.	Changes to final plat or plan. During the course of development construction in accordance with an approved final plat or plan, unforeseen circumstances may arise that require a technical change in the final plat or plan specifications. Where the need for such modifications arise during the construction process, the applicant shall request approval of any final plat or plan modifications from the development code administrator prior to final construction. Neither McDuffie County nor any official or body of the county shall assume liability or responsibility for any defects in construction. 
                  b.	Requirement for "as-built" plans and other technical information. 
                  1.	Preparation and specifications. After the preparation of the final plat, and before any improvements are accepted for maintenance by the local government, and before the subdivider or his agent are released from any bond requirement specified herein, the development code administrator shall receive formal written notice that all improvements have been installed as approved. Where said improvements have been installed in such a manner as to substantially vary from the final plat or plan in accordance with a modification approved by the planning commission, the applicant shall prepare and submit to the development code administrator a copy of "as-built" development plans and other technical information which may be needed. 
                  2.	Scale. The "as-built" plans shall be clearly and legibly drawn at a scale of 100 feet to one inch, or the same scale as the final plat. 
                  3.	Sheet size. The "as-built" plans shall be drawn in ink on suitable permanent reproducible material, on sheets 36 inches by 24 inches. If the complete plans cannot be shown on one sheet, it may be shown in sections on more than one sheet with an index map drawn at a reduced scale. In addition, one set shall be submitted in a format of 11″ × 17″ or smaller. 
                  4.	Ground elevations. The "as-built" plans shall show ground elevations, based on the datum plane of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, with a contour interval of five feet (or less if determined necessary by the development code administrator). 
                  5.	Existing conditions to be shown on "as-built" plans. In such instances where there have been substantial variations from approved development plans, the planning commission shall require each of the following, as applicable, or any additional information required: 
                  (i)	Final profiles of grades for streets.
                  (ii)	Final plan of sanitary sewers with grade, pipe sizes, and point of discharge.
                  (iii)	Final plan of storm drainage system with grade, pipe sizes, and location of outlets.

                  (v)	A complete listing of the deviations from the approved development plans made by the subdivider. 
                  6.	Certification of improvements prior to acceptance by the governing body. The planning commission and the development code administrator shall not recommend that any subdivision or development improvements be accepted for maintenance by the local government unless they have been installed in accordance with approved development plans or approved "as-built" plans and other technical information which may be required.

                  Sec. 44-167. - Certificate of zoning compliance. 
                  There is the likelihood that there were preexisting, or nonconforming nonresidential uses of land and or structures, in whole or in part, which were, as a practical manner, unable to be accounted for, and would not have been permitted at the time of passage of this chapter. In order to 1) confirm and properly document the existence of these types of structures and uses; 2) monitor their existing activities; 3) to facilitate petitions that may be proposed to accommodate future changes in the use of these properties, and, 4) to mitigate any potential conflict in land use or structures, the board of commissioners may consider a requirement that occupants or owners of all commercial, industrial, home occupation and cottage industry uses obtain from the planning commission a certificate of zoning compliance. This certificate shall carry a fee, to be determined by the board of commissioners to cover administrative costs associated with processing.

                  Sec. 44-181. - Generally. 
                  (a)	Types. There are three types of applications which shall represent an opportunity for petitioners to pursue proposed development activities, or to request amendment or relief from the requirements and standards of this chapter. The applications are: Administrative application, board application, and appeal application. 
                  (b)	Preapplication conference. Regardless of application type, a preapplication conference is required and is intended to assist both the county and the applicant in determining what type of review will be required for the proposed development activity. It also provides a means of exchanging information about the application process and how to develop land in conformance with the requirements and standards of this chapter.

No application shall be deemed complete unless accompanied by full payment of the appropriate application review fee. 
                  (1)	Administrative applications submission requirements. The applicant for an administrative application shall upon request submit to the development code administrator: 
                  a.	A completed application form. No fee is required.
                  b.	A plat of the subject property.
                  c.	A development plan drawn to scale showing in sufficient detail all proposed parcels, construction or structural changes, proposed buildings or structures to be added, or minor lot line adjustments whereby the development code administrator can determine compliance with this chapter. 
                  (c)	Review procedures. The development code administrator shall approve, disapprove, or otherwise reconcile development activity. The decision to approve the applicable development activity by the development code administrator shall be made after consideration of all the relevant facts before him/her.

                  (2)	Disapproval. If an administrative application is not approved or otherwise reconciled, the reason for disapproval shall be stated. 
                  (3)	Reconciliation. Any administrative application that has been formally disapproved, or deemed incomplete or deficient by the development code administrator may be resubmitted upon proper reconciliation. 
                  (4)	Review deadline. The development code administrator shall issue a final determination regarding an administrative application within 30 days of the date that the application is formally accepted by the development code administrator (or his/her designated agent) as complete in satisfaction of the applicable submission requirements.

                  (Ord. of 3-23-99, Art. IX, § 2)
                  Sec. 44-183. - Board application. 
                  (a)	Generally. A board application is a request or petition for development activities that require extensive review and a public hearing by the planning commission board. Following consideration by the planning commission board, including any required public hearing, the results of the board's decision shall be forwarded as a recommendation to the McDuffie County Board of Commissioners for final review. Board application activities include, but are not limited to: 
                  (1)	Variances.
                  (2)	Special exceptions.
                  (3)	Zoning changes.
                  (4)	Subdivision/planned development review.
                  (5)	Changes to the land development code.
                  (6)	Changes to the future land use map.
                  (7)	Adult entertainment review.
                  Note: For multiple applications of any of the above, see subsection (i) of this section] 
                  (b)	Variances. A variance is a request by an applicant to be allowed to deviate from the requirements of the dimensional standards of this chapter. Requests for variances include, but are not limited to, a request for reduced setbacks, reduced road frontage, reduced minimum lot size, reduced number of parking spaces, increased number of structures per lot, handicapped variance, etc. 
                  (1)	Application procedures. Any applicant seeking review of an application for a variance from the dimensional requirements of this chapter shall submit a completed application to the development code administrator within 30 days of the date of the planning commission board meeting at which such application would be considered. In addition to the completed application, the applicant may be required to submit additional information as the development code administrator may require including, but not limited to; a plat of the property showing all structures including the dimensions of same; a notation on the plat showing the linear variance requested; a deed of the subject property; and if the owner(s) is not the applicant, a letter of authorization from the owner(s) of the property authorizing the application for the variance. 
                  (2)	Application fee. At the time of application, the applicant shall remit to the office of the planning commission an application fee, for a single property variance request, of $100.00 plus costs for legal notices and the placement of notice signs. Each additional variance request for a separate parcel if contiguous shall be $50.00 plus costs for legal notices and the placement of notice signs. 
                  (3)	Review process. See section 44-184 of this article. 
                  (c)	Special exceptions. Special exceptions are land uses which are subject to the imposition of land use limiting conditions which modify the land use to make it more compatible with the principally permitted uses in one or more zoning districts, but may not be appropriate generally through out the district as a whole, due to their nature, scale, and intensity of use. Such applications are commonly referred to as "conditional use." Examples of typical conditions may be found in section 44-72 of article IV. 
                  (1)	Application procedures. Any applicant seeking review of an application for a special exception shall submit a completed application to the development code administrator within 30 days of the date of the planning commission board meeting at which such application would be considered. In addition to the completed application, the applicant may be required to submit additional information as the development code administrator may require including, but not limited to; a scaled development or site plan in a formal not greater than 11″ × 17″ showing the proposed development of the property and its zoning classification; a plat of the property; a deed of the subject property; and if the owner(s) is not the applicant, a letter of authorization from the owner(s) of the property authorizing the application for the special exception. Since special exception uses are uses which are generally accepted uses within the appropriate zoning district, an application for a special exception does not imply the need for, nor shall it constitute in itself, an application for a change in zoning. 
                  (2)	Application fees. The applicant shall remit to the office of the planning commission an application fee of $100.00 plus costs for legal notices and the placement of notice signs for a single property special exception request. 
                  (3)	Review process. See section 44-184 of this article. 
                  (d)	Zoning changes/rezoning. Unless initiated by the board of commissioners, or the planning commission (board), all proposed zoning map changes must be submitted by the owner of the subject property or the duly authorized agent of the subject property owner. A duly authorized agent must submit notarized written authorization from the property owner with the request for zoning map amendment. 
                  (1)	Application procedures. Any applicant seeking review of an application for a zoning change shall submit a completed application to the development code administrator within 30 days of the date of the planning commission board meeting at which such application would be considered. In addition to the completed application, the applicant may be required to submit additional information as the development code administrator may require including, but not limited to; a scaled development or site plan in a format not greater than 11″ × 17″ showing the proposed development of the property and its zoning classification; a plat of the property not greater than 11″ × 17″; and a deed of the subject property. 
                  (2)	Application fees. The applicant shall remit to the office of the planning commission an application fee of $150.00 plus costs for legal notices and the placement of notice signs, for a zoning change request involving up to three contiguous lots or parcels, and, for a change to the same zoning classification. Each additional contiguous lot (for the same zoning classification) thereafter shall be charged an application fee of $75.00. Requests for changes to differing zoning classifications shall each be considered as separate applications even though the lots may be contiguous. 
                  (3)	Review process. See section 44-184 of this article. 
                  (e)	Subdivision/planned development review. An application for subdivision development (with interior streets) or for a planned development/planned unit development is one which requires substantial time for discretionary review and subsequent action requiring not less than one, and possibly two public hearings by the planning commission. A subdivision development along an existing county maintained road or street may be subject to the provisions of this section particularly if the subdivision involves more than ten subdivided lots. 
                  (1)	Application procedures. Any applicant seeking review of an application for a subdivision (with interior streets) or a planned development/planned unit development shall submit a completed application to the development code administrator within 45 days of the date of the planning commission board meeting at which such application would be considered. In addition to the completed application, the applicant will generally be required to submit seven copies of a preliminary development plan prepared by either a Registered Georgia Professional Land Surveyor or Engineer and containing at a minimum, the following: 
                  a.	A scale not greater than 1″ = 100′.
                  b.	A sheet size not greater than 24″ × 36″.
                  c.	One copy of the development plan formatted to 11″ × 17″.

                  t.	Design of a typical road cross section.
                  Upon review by the planning commission board, the board shall specify any amendments to the development plan as it deem necessary to ensure the public health, safety, and general welfare. The applicant shall then amend the plan to incorporate the amendments specified by the board and resubmit the plan to the development code administrator to verify compliance with the board's required amendments. Should the plan be found to be in compliance with the board's required changes, the provisions of this chapter, and in particular the provisions of this article and of article VII (Planned Development Requirements), the administrator may approve the plan whereupon construction of the development may begin. 
                  (2)	Application fees. The applicant shall remit to the office of the planning commission an application fee of $250.00 plus cost of legal notices and signs. In the case of a subdivision involving new interior streets, the fee shall be $250.00 plus $10.00 per lot over 25 lots, plus cost of legal notices and signs. 
                  (3)	Review process. See section 44-184 of this article. 
                  (f)	Land development code text changes. An application for a change in the land development code may request an amendment, supplement, or other change only to the text (including tables) of the code. 
                  (1)	Application procedures. Any applicant seeking a review or consideration of a change to the land development code shall submit a completed application to the development code administrator within 45 days of the date of the planning commission board meeting at which such application would be considered. In addition to the application, the applicant shall include a detailed written explanation of those articles, sections, paragraphs, sentences, lists or tables for which they are requesting a review. Such items shall be formatted in a manner as to clearly indicate the current wording followed immediately by the recommended change(s). In addition to the above requirements, the applicant may be required to submit such other documentation or information as is requested by the development code administrator. Such proposed changes shall be forwarded to the county attorney for review. 
                  (2)	Application fees. The applicant shall remit to the office of the planning commission an application fee of $100.00 plus cost of legal notices. Should signage and advertising be required, the applicant shall remit the cost of same.

The applicant shall remit to the office of the planning commission an application fee of $150.00 plus costs for legal notices and the placement of notice signs, for a land use change request involving up to three contiguous lots or parcels, for a change to the same land use classification. Each additional contiguous lot (for the same land use classification) thereafter shall be charged an application fee of $75.00. Requests for changes to differing land use classifications shall each be considered as separate applications even though the lots may be contiguous. Applications of this type may require one or more public hearings. 
                  (3)	Review process. See section 44-184 of this article. 
                  (h)	Adult entertainment review. Even though not specifically incorporated into and made a part of this land development code, the requirements of any adult entertainment ordinance hereafter adopted by McDuffie County shall be reviewed by the planning commission board for compliance with the provisions for the granting of a special exception and any other considerations as may affect the use of land in the county for that purpose. 
                  (1)	Application procedures.

                  (a)	General provision. Following are the general provision for the review of applications before the planning commission board and board of commissioners. It should be recognized that the review procedures outlined in the following sections will under normal circumstances apply to those applications found in section 44-183(a) of this article, with the exception of subdivision/planned development and adult entertainment reviews since these reviews are created to verify compliance with the provisions of this chapter. However, if, and only if, a variance, zoning change, etc., is initiated by the applicant, or required by the planning commission board regarding either of these two developments, then the board of Commission shall review same. 
                  (b)	Planning commission board. Upon completion of the final review by the planning commission board, the planning commission (office) shall forward to the McDuffie County Board of Commissioners within 30 days a recommendation addressing each application reviewed by the planning commission board.

                  Sec. 44-185. - Appeal Application. 
                  (a)	Generally.

For example, if the DCA denies an administrative application for a minor variance, the applicant shall be required to submit an application and fee as noted in section 44-183(b) of this article; in this case $100.00 plus costs, since the application will be submitted to the board for full review. 
                  The application fee shall be $50.00 for any application where an application has received a prior review by the planning commission board. Under no circumstances shall an appeal be substituted for any standard application process to the planning commission board. 
                  (2)	In the case of appeals of decisions of the planning commission board to the board of commissioners, a completed application form and a fee of $50.00.

For purposes of this article, certain terms and words related to solar land uses, and associated legal, scientific, technical, and general terms, are hereby defined, and shall have those meanings ascribed to them as provided herein. All other words and phrases shall assume their common, ordinary meaning, unless the context clearly requires otherwise, or a specific definition has been ascribed to them as provided within a separate section of this article. 
                  (b)	Categories of solar land uses. The terms and definitions provided in this subsection refer to the types of principal and accessory solar land uses that are regulated by the provisions of this article. For purposes of categorizing and defining solar land uses, the terms herein may be considered "umbrella" in nature, meaning that they encompass a wide variety of utility scale solar collection, conversion and transmission systems for off-site power consumption as well as small-scale individual systems intended for on-site power consumption for uses such as a residence or business. Some of the terms provided in this section are augmented by supporting figures and/or representative illustrations. 
                  (1)	Solar energy system: A system capable of collecting and converting solar radiant energy (through direct, diffuse, and/or reflective collection) into heat, mechanical, or electrical energy and transfers the produced electricity in to a separate apparatus to store or to a point of use which include, but are not limited to, water heaters, interior space heaters or coolers, or electrical energy generation. Solar energy systems primarily consist of solar collection devices and mechanical equipment related to solar energy (transformers, inverters, etc.). 
                  (2)	Solar energy system, principal (PSES): A solar energy system which is the principal or primary use on a single lot or parcel which is used to collect and convert solar energy into usable electricity using on-site equipment for the primary purpose of transmitting electricity off-site to be used by an electric utility. There systems include all uses defined by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) under Code 221114 which includes solar farms. (See figures B.1 and B.2). 

                  Figure B.1: A principal solar energy system may occupy an entire lot.

                  Figure B-2: A property owner may choose to subdivide their property and place a solar farm on one of the newly created lots thus creating a principal use for that lot.
                  (3)	Solar energy system, accessory (ASES): A solar energy system that is an accessory use to the principal use of a property, meaning it is incidental to the principal use and is subordinate in area or purpose. Accessory systems may be roof-mounted, ground-mounted or parking-mounted. (See figures C.1 and C.2). 

                  Figure C.1: Accessory solar energy systems may include building-mounted and/or ground-mounted systems, as shown in this illustration. They may be allowed in front, side or rear yards, although some restrictions may apply.

                  Figure C.2: Accessory solar energy systems can also include parking-mounted systems, as illustrated above. An accessory system can include any combination of building-mounted, ground-mounted or parking-mounted systems, subject to additional conditions.

                  (2)	Mechanical equipment shall comply with the setbacks specified for accessory structures in the underlying zoning district. 
                  (f)	Historic districts. Accessory solar energy systems on buildings or properties within federal, state, or local designated historic districts or on locally designated historic buildings will require a certificate of appropriateness unless the installation is not visible from the street. For the purpose of accessory solar energy systems, the certificate of appropriateness shall be issued by the McDuffie County Planning Commission. 
                  (g)	Other considerations. 
                  (1)	Accessory solar energy systems must comply with all applicable building and electrical code requirements as adopted by the Georgia Department of Community Affairs. 
                  (2)	Owners of accessory solar energy systems are solely responsible for negotiating with other property owners for any desired solar easements to protect access to sunlight. Any such easements must be recorded with the McDuffie County Clerk of Superior Court.

                  (2)	All accessory solar energy systems other than building-mounted (flush-mounted) systems and building-integrated systems shall require a building permit. 
                  (3)	Systems that do not meet the conditions in this section will require a variance.
                  (4)	A solar energy system shall not be constructed until a building permit has been issued following a zoning review. 
                  (i)	Plan applications. 
                  (1)	Plan applications for accessory solar energy systems shall be accompanied by to-scale horizontal and vertical (elevation) drawings. The drawings must show the location of the system on the building or on the property for a ground-mounted system, including the property lines. 
                  (2)	For all building-mounted (nonflush-mounted) systems, the elevation must show the highest finished slope of the solar collector and the slope of the finished roof surface on which it is mounted. 
                  (j)	Administrative variance. This code encourages the installation of productive solar energy systems and recognizes that a balance must be achieved between character and aesthetic considerations and the reasonable desire of building owners to harvest their renewable energy resources. Where the standards in this article cannot be met without diminishing, as defined below, the minimum reasonable performance of the solar energy system, an administrative variance may be sought from the zoning official. An administrative variance shall be granted if the administrative variance standards are met. 
                  (1)	Minimum performance design standards. The following design considerations are needed for the efficient operation of a solar energy system: 
                  a.	Fixed-mount active solar energy systems. Solar energy systems must be mounted to face with 45 degrees of south (180 degrees azimuth). 
                  b.	Solar electric (photovoltaic) systems. Solar electric (photovoltaic) systems must have a pitch that is within 20 degrees of latitude, a pitch of between 20 and 65 degrees. 
                  c.	Solar hot water systems. Solar collectors need to be mounted at a pitch between 40 and 60 degrees. 
                  (2)	Standards for an administrative variance. A variance shall be granted by the zoning official if the applicant demonstrates that the following safety, performance and aesthetic conditions are met: 
                  a.	Aesthetic conditions. The solar energy system must be designed to blend into the architecture of the building or be screened from routine view from public rights-of-way other than alleys to the maximum extent possible while still allowing the system to be mounted for efficient performance. 
                  b.	Safety conditions. All applicable health and safety standards are met.

                  Sec. 58-3. - Drug and alcohol testing policy. 
                  (a)	Purpose. 
                  (1)	McDuffie County employees provide services for the residents of McDuffie County, Georgia. Part of our mission is to ensure that this service is delivered safely, efficiently, and effectively by establishing a drug and alcohol-free work environment, and to ensure that the workplace remains free from the effects of drugs and alcohol in order to promote the health and safety of employees and the general public. In keeping with this mission, the county board of commissioners declares that the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispense, possession, or use of controlled substances or misuse of alcohol is prohibited for all employees. 
                  (2)	Additionally, the purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines to maintain a drug and alcohol-free workplace in compliance with the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, and the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991. This policy is intended to comply with all applicable federal regulations governing workplace anti-drug and alcohol programs in the transit industry. Specifically, the federal transit administration (FTA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation has published 49 CFR Part 653 and Part 654, as amended, that mandate urine drug testing and breath alcohol testing for safety-sensitive positions, and prohibit performance of safety-sensitive functions when there is a positive test result. The U. S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) has also published 49 CFR Part 40, as amended, that sets standards for the collection and testing of urine and breath specimens. 
                  (b)	Applicability. This drug and alcohol testing policy applies to all county employees (full or part-time) when performing any county business. County employees that do not perform safety-sensitive functions are also covered under this policy under the sole authority of the county. A safety-sensitive function is any duty related to the safe operation of a vehicle, maintenance of a vehicle or equipment, public safety personnel, and any other employee who is required to hold a commercial drivers license. Maintenance functions include the repair, overhaul, and rebuild of engines, vehicles and/or equipment. A list of safety-sensitive positions that perform one or more of the above mentioned duties are provided in attachment A. Supervisors are only safety sensitive if they perform one of the above functions. 
                  (c)	Definitions. 
                  Accident means an occurrence associated with the operation of a vehicle or equipment, if as a result: 
                  (1)	An individual dies;
                  (2)	An individual suffers a bodily injury and immediately receives medical treatment away from the scene of the accident; or 
                  (3)	One or more vehicles incur disabling damage as the result of the occurrence and is transported away from the scene by a tow truck or other vehicle. For purposes of this definition, disabling damage means damage, which precludes departure of any vehicle from the scene of the occurrence in its usual manner in daylight after simple repairs. Disabling damage includes damage to vehicles that could have been operated but would have been further damaged if so operated, but does not include damage which can be remedied temporarily at the scene of the occurrence without special tools or parts, tire disablement without other damage even if no spare tire is available, or damage to headlights, taillights, turn signals, horn, mirrors or windshield wipers that makes them inoperative. 
                  Adulterated specimen means a specimen that contains a substance that is not expected to be present in human urine, or contains a substance expected to be present but is at a concentration so high that it is not consistent with human urine. 
                  Alcohol means the intoxicating agent in beverage alcohol, ethyl alcohol, or other low molecular weight alcohols contained in any beverage, mixture, mouthwash, candy, food, preparation or medication. 
                  Alcohol concentration means expressed in terms of grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath as measured by an evidential breath testing device. 
                  Canceled test means a drug test that has been declared invalid by a medical review officer. A canceled test is neither positive nor negative. 
                  Covered employee means an employee who performs a safety-sensitive function including an applicant or transferee whom will be hired to perform a safety-sensitive function (See attachment A for a list of covered employees), and other employees, applicants, or transferee that will not perform a safety-sensitive function. 
                  Dilute specimen means a specimen with creatinine and specific gravity values that are lower than expected for human urine. 
                  Disabling damage means damage that precludes departure of any vehicle from the scene of the occurrence in its usual manner in daylight after simple repairs. Disabling damage includes damage to vehicles that could have been operated but would have been further damaged if so operated, but does not include damage which can be remedied temporarily at the scene of the occurrence without special tools or parts, tire disablement without other damage even if no spare tire is available, or damage to headlights, taillights, turn signals, horn, mirrors or windshield wipers that makes them inoperative. 
                  Medical review officer (MRO) means a licensed physician (medical doctor or doctor of osteopathy) responsible for receiving laboratory results generated by the drug testing program who has knowledge of substance abuse disorders, and has appropriate medical training to interpret and evaluate an individual's confirmed positive test result, together with his/her medical history, and any other relevant bio-medical information. 
                  Negative test result, for a drug test, means a verified presence of the identified drug or its metabolite below the minimum levels specified in 49 CFR Part 40, as amended. An alcohol concentration of less than 0.02 BAC is a negative test result. 
                  Non-negative test result means a test result found to be adulterated, substitute, invalid, or positive for drug/drug metabolites. Non-negative results are considered a positive test or refusal to test if MRO cannot determine legitimate medical explanation. 
                  Positive test result, for a drug test, means a verified presence of the identified drug or its metabolite at or above the minimum levels specified in 49 CFR Part 40, as amended. A positive alcohol test result means a confirmed alcohol concentration of 0.04 BAC or greater. 
                  Prohibited drug means marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, or phencyclidine at levels above the minimum thresholds specified in 49 CFR Part 40, as amended. 
                  Revenue service vehicles means to include all transit vehicles that are used for passenger transportation service or that require a CDL to operate. 
                  Safety-sensitive functions means to include (a) the operation of a transit revenue service vehicle even when the vehicle is not in revenue service; (b) the operation of a non-revenue service vehicle by an employee when the operation of such a vehicle requires the driver to hold a commercial drivers license (CDL); (c) maintaining a revenue service vehicle or equipment used in revenue service; (d) dispatchers and (e) carrying a firearm for security purposes. 
                  Substance abuse professional (SAP) means a licensed physician (medical doctor or doctor of osteopathy) or licensed or certified psychologist, social worker, employee assistance professional, or addiction counselor (certified by the National Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors Certification Commission or by the International Certification Reciprocity Consortium/Alcohol and other Drug Abuse) with knowledge of and clinical experience in the diagnosis and treatment of drug and alcohol related disorders. 
                  Substituted specimen means a specimen with creatinine and specific gravity values that are so diminished that they are not consistent with human urine. 
                  Test refusal means the following are considered a refusal to test if the employee: 
                  • Fails to appear for any test within a reasonable time, as determined by the employer, after being directed to do so by the employer; 
                  • Fails to remain at the testing site until the testing process is complete; 
                  • Fails to provide a urine specimen for any drug test required by Part 40 or DOT agency regulations; 
                  • In the case of a directly observed or monitored collection in a drug test, fails to permit the observation or monitoring of your provision of a specimen; 
                  • Fails to provide a sufficient amount of urine when directed, and it has been determined, through a required medical evaluation, that there was no adequate medical explanation for the failure; 
                  • Fails or declines to take a second test the employer or collector has directed you to take; 
                  • Fails to undergo a medical examination or evaluation, as directed by the MRO as part of the verification process, or as directed by the DER as part of the "shy bladder" procedures; 
                  • Fails to cooperate with any part of the testing process (e.g., refuse to empty pockets when so directed by the collector, behave in a confrontational way that disrupts the collection process); 
                  • If the MRO reports that there is verified adulterated or substituted test result. 
                  Verified negative test means a drug test result reviewed by a medical review officer and determined to have no evidence of prohibited drug use above the minimum cutoff levels established by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). 
                  Verified positive test means a drug test result reviewed by a medical review officer and determined to have evidence of prohibited drug use above the minimum cutoff levels specified in 49 CFR Part 40 as revised. 
                  Validity testing is the evaluation of the specimen to determine if it is consistent with normal human urine. The purpose of validity testing is to determine whether certain adulterants or foreign substances were added to the urine, if the urine was diluted, or if the specimen was substituted. 
                  (d)	Education and training. 
                  (1)	Every county employee will receive a copy of this policy and will have ready access to the corresponding federal regulations including 49 CFR Parts 653,654, and 40. In addition, all employees will undergo a minimum of 60 minutes of training on the signs and symptoms of drug use including the effects and consequences of drug use on personal health, safety, and the work environment. The training also includes manifestations and behavioral cues that may indicate prohibited drug use. 
                  (2)	All supervisory personnel who are in a position to determine employee fitness for duty will receive 60 minutes of reasonable suspicion training on the physical, behavioral, and performance indicators of probable drug use and 60 minutes of additional reasonable suspicion training on the physical, behavioral, speech, and performance indicators of probable alcohol misuse. 
                  (3)	Information on the signs, symptoms, health effects, and consequences of alcohol misuse is presented in attachment B of this policy. 
                  (e)	Prohibited substances. Prohibited substances addressed by this policy include the following: 
                  (1)	Illegally Used Controlled Substance or Drugs Under the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 any drug or any substance identified in Schedule I through V of Section 202 of the Controlled Substance Act (21 U.S.C. 812), and as further defined by 21 CFR 1300.11 through 1300.15 is prohibited at all times in the workplace unless a legal prescription has been written for the substance. This includes, but is not limited to: marijuana, amphetamines, opiates, phencyclidine (PCP), and cocaine, as well as any drug not approved for medical use by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Illegal use includes use of any illegal drug, misuse of legally prescribed drugs, and use of illegally obtained prescription drugs. Also, the medical use of marijuana, or the use of hemp related products, as which cause drug or drug metabolites to be present in the body above the minimum thresholds is a violation of this policy. 
                  Federal Transit Administration drug testing regulations (49 CFR Part 653) require that all covered employees be tested for marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, and phencyclidine as described in Section H of this policy. Illegal use of these five drugs is prohibited at all times and thus, covered employees may be tested for these drugs anytime that they are on duty. 
                  (2)	Legal drugs: The appropriate use of legally prescribed drugs and non-prescription medications is not prohibited. However, the use of any substance which carries a warning label that indicates that mental functioning, motor skills, or judgment may be adversely affected must be reported to the employee's supervisor and the employee is required to provide a written release from his/her doctor or pharmacist indicating that the employee can perform his/her safety-sensitive functions. 
                  (3)	Alcohol: The use of beverages containing alcohol (including any mouthwash, medication, food, candy) or any other substances such that alcohol is present in the body while performing safety-sensitive job functions is prohibited. An alcohol test can be performed on a covered employee under 49 CFR Part 654 just before, during, or just after the performance of safety-sensitive job functions. Under the supervisor's authority, an alcohol test can be performed any time a covered employee is on duty. 
                  (f)	Prohibited conduct. 
                  (1)	All covered employees are prohibited from reporting for duty or remaining on duty any time there is a quantifiable presence of a prohibited drug in the body above the minimum thresholds defined in 49 CFR Part 40, as amended. 
                  (2)	Each covered employee is prohibited from consuming alcohol while performing safety-sensitive job functions or while on-call to perform safety-sensitive job functions. If an on-call employee has consumed alcohol, they must acknowledge the use of alcohol at the time that they are called to report for duty. The covered employee will subsequently be relieved of his/her on-call responsibilities. 
                  (3)	The department head shall not permit any employee to perform or continue to perform any functions if it has actual knowledge that the employee is using alcohol. 
                  (4)	Each employee is prohibited from reporting to work or remaining on duty while having an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater regardless of when the alcohol was consumed. 
                  (5)	No covered employee shall consume alcohol for eight hours following involvement in an accident or until he/she submits to the post-accident drug/alcohol test, whichever occurs first. 
                  (6)	No covered employee shall consume alcohol within four hours prior to the performance of safety sensitive job functions. 
                  (7)	The county under its own authority also prohibits the consumption of alcohol during lunch periods; rest breaks, split shift breaks, or anytime the employee is in uniform. 
                  (8)	Consistent with the Drug-free Workplace Act of 1988, all the county employees are prohibited from engaging in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of prohibited substances in the work place [or] vehicles, while in uniform or while on the county business. 
                  (g)	Drug statute conviction. Consistent with the Drug Free Workplace Act of 1998, all employees are required to notify the McDuffie County management of any criminal drug statute conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace within five days after such conviction. Failure to comply with this provision shall result in disciplinary action as defined in subsection (q)(10), of this policy. 
                  (h)	Testing requirements. 
                  (1)	Analytical urine drug testing and breath testing for alcohol will be conducted as required by 49CFR Part 40. All covered employees shall be subject to testing prior to employment, for reasonable suspicion, following an accident, and random as defined in subsection (k), (l), (m), and (n) of this policy. All covered employees who have tested positive for drugs or alcohol on a random, reasonable suspicion, or post-accident will be tested prior to returning to duty after completion of the substance abuse professional's recommended treatment program and subsequent release to duty. Follow-up testing will also be conducted following return-to-duty for a period of one to five years, with at least six tests performed during the first year. The duration and frequency of the follow-up testing above the minimum requirements will be at the discretion of the substance abuse professional. 
                  (2)	A drug test can be performed any time an employee is on duty. An alcohol test can be performed just before, during, or after the performance of a safety-sensitive job function. Under the county authority, an alcohol test can be performed any time a covered employee is on duty. 
                  (3)	All covered employees will be subject to urine drug testing and breath alcohol testing as a condition of ongoing employment with the county government. Any safety-sensitive employee who refuses to comply with a request for testing shall be removed from duty and subject to discipline as defined in subsection (q)(3), of this policy. Any covered employee who is suspected of providing false information in connection with a drug test, or who is suspected of falsifying test results through tampering, contamination, adulteration, or substitution will be required to undergo an observed collection. Verification of the above listed actions will be considered a test refusal and will result in the employee's removal from duty and disciplined as defined in subsection (q)(3), of this policy. Refusal can also include an inability to provide a sufficient urine specimen or breath sample without a valid medical explanation, as well as a verbal or written declaration, obstructive behavior, or physical absence resulting in the inability to conduct the test within the specified time frame. 
                  (i)	Drug testing procedures. 
                  (1)	Testing shall be conducted in a manner to assure a high degree of accuracy and reliability and using techniques, equipment, and laboratory facilities that have been approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service (DHHS). All testing will be conducted consistent with the procedures set forth in 49 CFR Part 40, as amended. The procedures will be performed in a private, confidential manner and every effort will be made to protect the employee, the integrity of the drug testing procedure, and the validity of the test result. 
                  (2)	The drugs that will be tested for include marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, and phencyclidine. After the identity of the donor is checked using picture identification, a urine specimen will be collected using the split specimen collection method described in 49 CFR Part 40, as amended. Each specimen will be accompanied by a DOT chain of custody and control form and identified using a unique identification number that attributes the specimen to the correct individual. The specimen analysis will be conducted at a DHHS certified laboratory. An initial drug screen and validity test will be conducted on the primary urine specimen. For those specimens that are not negative, a confirmatory gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) test will be performed. The test will be considered positive if the amounts of the drug(s) and/or its metabolites identified by the GC/MS test are above the minimum thresholds established in 49 CFR Part 40, as amended. 
                  (3)	The test results from the DHHS certified laboratory will be reported to a medical review officer. A medical review officer (MRO) is a licensed physician with detailed knowledge of substance abuse disorders and drug testing. The MRO will review the test results to ensure the scientific validity of the test and to determine whether there is a legitimate medical explanation for a confirmed positive, substitute, or adulterated test result. The MRO will attempt to contact the employee to notify the employee of the non-negative laboratory result, and provide the employee with an opportunity to explain the confirmed laboratory test result. The MRO will subsequently review the employee's medical history/medical records as appropriate to determine whether there is a legitimate medical explanation for a non-negative laboratory result. If no legitimate medical explanation is found, the test will be verified positive or refusal to test and reported to the McDuffie County Drug and Alcohol Program Manager (DAPM). If a legitimate explanation is found, the MRO will report the test result as negative to the DAPM and no further action will be taken. If the test is invalid without a medical explanation, a retest will be conducted under direct observation. 
                  (4)	Any covered employee who questions the results of a required drug test under subparagraphs (l) through (p) of this policy may request that the split sample be tested. The split sample test must be conducted at a second DHHS-certified laboratory with no affiliation with the laboratory that analyzed the primary specimen. The test must be conducted on the split sample that was provided by the employee at the same time as the primary sample. The method of collecting, storing, and testing the split sample will be consistent with the procedures set forth in 49 CFR Part 40, as amended. The employee's request for a split sample test must be made to the medical review officer within 72 hours of notice of the original sample verified test result. Requests after 72 hours will only be accepted at the discretion of the MRO if the delay was due to documentable facts that were beyond the control of the employee. The county will ensure that the costs for the split specimen are covered in order for a timely analysis of the sample, however the county will seek reimbursement for the split sample test from the employee. 
                  (5)	If the analysis of the split specimen fails to confirm the presence of the drug(s) detected in the primary specimen, if the split specimen is not able to be analyzed, or if the results of the split specimen are not scientifically adequate, the MRO will declare the original test to be canceled and will direct the county to retest the employee under direct observation. 
                  (6)	The split specimen will be stored at the initial laboratory until the analysis of the primary specimen is completed. If the primary specimen is negative, the split will be discarded. If the primary is positive, the split will be retained for testing if so requested by the employee through the medical review officer. If the primary specimen is positive, it will be retained in frozen storage for one year and the split specimen will also be retained for one year. 
                  (7)	Observed collections. Consistent with 49 CFR Part 40 collection under direct observation (by a person of the same gender) with no advance notice will occur if: 
                  a.	The laboratory reports to the MRO that a specimen is invalid, and the MRO reports to the county management that there was not an adequate medical explanation for the result; or 
                  b.	The MRO reports to the county management that the original positive, adulterated, or substituted test result had to be cancelled because the test of the split specimen could not be performed. 
                  c.	The county may direct a collection under direct observation of an employee if the drug test is a return-to-duty test or a follow-up test. 
                  d.	The collector, must immediately conduct a collection under direct observation if:
                  1.	They are directed by the county management to do so; or
                  2.	The collector observes materials brought to the collection site or the employee's conduct clearly indicates an attempt to tamper with a specimen; or 
                  3.	The temperature on the original specimen was out of range
                  4.	The original specimen appeared to have been tampered with.
                  (j)	Alcohol testing procedures. 
                  (1)	A trained breath alcohol technician (BAT) will conduct tests for breath alcohol concentration utilizing a national highway traffic safety administration (NHTSA) -approved evidential breath testing device (EBT) operated. Alcohol screening tests may be performed using a non-evidential testing device that is also approved by NHSTA. If the initial test indicates an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, a second test will be performed to confirm the results of the initial test. The confirmatory test must occur on an EBT. The confirmatory test will be conducted at least fifteen minutes after the completion of the initial test. The confirmatory test will be performed using a NHTSA-approved EBT operated by a trained BAT. The EBT will identify each test by a unique sequential identification number. This number, time, and unit identifier will be provided on each EBT printout. The EBT printout, along with an approved alcohol testing form, will be used to document the test, the subsequent results, and to attribute the test to the correct employee. The test will be performed in a private, confidential manner as required by 49 CFR Part 40, as amended. The procedure will be followed as prescribed to protect the employee and to maintain the integrity of the alcohol testing procedures and validity of the test result. 
                  (2)	An employee who has a confirmed alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater will be considered a positive alcohol test and in violation of this policy. The consequences of a positive alcohol test are described in subsection (q)(4) and (5), of this policy. Even though an employee who has a confirmed alcohol concentration of 0.02 to 0.039 is not considered positive, the employee shall still be removed from duty for at least eight hours or for the duration of the work day whichever is longer and will be subject to the consequences described in subsection (q)(9), of this policy. An alcohol concentration of less than 0.02 will be considered a negative test. 
                  (3)	The county affirms the need to protect individual dignity, privacy, and confidentiality throughout the testing process. If at any time the integrity of the testing procedures or the validity of the test results is compromised, the test will be canceled. Minor inconsistencies or procedural flaws that do not impact the test result will not result in a cancelled test. 
                  (k)	Pre-employment testing. All applicants for covered transit positions shall undergo urine drug testing prior to hire or transfer into a covered position that requires the performance of a safety-sensitive function. 
                  (1)	All offers of employment for covered positions shall be extended conditional upon the applicant passing a drug test. An applicant shall not be hired into a covered position unless the applicant takes a drug test with verified negative results. 
                  (2)	A non-covered employee shall not be placed, transferred or promoted into a covered position until the employee takes a drug test with verified negative results. 
                  (3)	If an applicant fails a pre-employment drug test, the conditional offer of employment shall be rescinded. Failure of a pre-employment drug test will disqualify an applicant for employment for a period of at least one year. Evidence of the absence of drug dependency from a substance abuse professional that meets with 49 CFR Part 40 as amended and a negative pre-employment drug test will be required prior to further consideration for employment. The cost for the assessment and any subsequent treatment will be the sole responsibility of the applicant. 
                  (4)	When an employee being placed, transferred, or promoted from a non-covered position to a covered position submits a drug test with a verified positive result, the employee shall be subject to disciplinary action in accordance with subsection (q)(4), (5) and (9), herein. 
                  (5)	If a pre-employment/pre-transfer test is canceled, the county depending on the circumstances, may require the applicant to take and pass another pre-employment drug test or may consider the cancellation as a refusal to take the test when scheduled and make the employee ineligible for the position. 
                  (6)	In instances where a covered employee is on extended leave for a period of 45 days or more, the employee may be required to take a drug test and have negative test results prior to the conduct of safety-sensitive job functions. 
                  (7)	An applicant with a dilute negative test result will be required to retest.
                  (l)	Reasonable suspicion testing. 
                  (1)	All the county employees will be subject to a reasonable suspicion drug and/or alcohol test when there are reasons to believe that drug or alcohol use is impacting job performance and safety. Reasonable suspicion shall mean that there is objective evidence, based upon specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations of the employee's appearance, behavior, speech or body odor that are consistent with possible drug use and/or alcohol misuse. Reasonable suspicion referrals must be made by one supervisor who is trained to detect the signs and symptoms of drug and alcohol use, and who reasonably concludes that an employee may be adversely affected or impaired in his/her work performance due to possible prohibited substance abuse or alcohol misuse. Under McDuffie County's authority, a reasonable suspicion alcohol test may be performed any time the covered employee is on duty. 
                  (2)	Supervisors should avoid placing themselves and/or others into a situation that might endanger the physical safety of those present. The employee shall be placed on administrative leave pending disciplinary action described in subsection (q)(4), (5) and (9), of this policy. An employee who refuses an instruction to submit to a drug/alcohol test shall not be permitted to finish his or her shift and shall immediately be placed on administrative leave pending disciplinary action as specified in subsection (q)(3), of this policy. 
                  (3)	A written record of the observations that led to a drug/alcohol test based on reasonable suspicion shall be prepared and signed by the supervisor making the observation prior to the release of the test results. This written record shall be submitted to the county manager and shall be attached to the forms reporting the test results. 
                  (4)	When there are no specific, contemporaneous, articulable objective facts that indicate current drug or alcohol use, but the employee (who is not already a participant in a treatment program) admits the abuse of alcohol or other substances to a supervisor in his/her chain of command, the employee shall be referred to the SAP for an assessment. The county shall place the employee on administrative leave in accordance with the provisions set forth under subsection (q)(9), of this policy. Testing in this circumstance would be performed under the direct authority of the county since the employee self-referred to management, testing under this circumstance would not be considered a violation of this policy or a positive test result under federal authority. However, self-referral does not exempt the covered employee from testing under federal authority as specified in subsections (l) through (n) of this policy or the associated consequences as specified in subsection (q)(9). 
                  (m)	Post-accident testing. All employees will be required to undergo urine and breath testing if they are involved in an accident. 
                  (1)	As soon as practicable following an accident, as defined in this policy, the appropriate supervisor shall ensure that an employee, required to be tested under this section, is tested as soon as practicable, but no longer than eight hours of the accident for alcohol, and within 32 hours for drugs. If an alcohol test is not performed within two hours of the accident, the supervisor will document the reason(s) for the delay. If the alcohol test is not conducted within eight hours, or the drug test within 32 hours, attempts to conduct the test must cease and the reasons for the failure to test documented. 
                  (2)	Any employee involved in an accident must refrain from alcohol use for eight hours following the accident, or until he/she undergoes a post-accident alcohol test. 
                  (3)	An employee who is subject to post-accident testing who fails to remain readily available for such testing, including notifying a supervisor of his or her location if he or she leaves the scene of the accident prior to submission to such test, may be deemed to have refused to submit to testing. 
                  (4)	Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the delay of necessary medical attention for the injured following an accident, or to prohibit an employee from leaving the scene of an accident for the period necessary to obtain assistance in responding to the accident, or to obtain necessary emergency medical care. 
                  (5)	In the rare event that the local hospital is unable to perform an FTA drug and alcohol test (i.e., employee is unconscious, employee is detained by law enforcement agency), the county may use drug and alcohol post-accident test results administered by local law enforcement officials in lieu of the FTA test. The local law enforcement officials must have independent authority for the test and the employer must obtain the results in conformance with local law. 
                  (n)	Random testing. All employees will be subjected to random, unannounced testing. The selection of employees shall be made by a scientifically valid method of randomly generating an employee identifier from the appropriate pool of safety-sensitive employees. No employee shall be randomly tested more than twice per year. This does not preclude an employee from being tested for cause. 
                  (1)	The dates for administering unannounced testing of randomly selected employees shall be spread reasonably throughout the calendar year. 
                  (2)	The number of employees randomly selected for drug/alcohol testing during the calendar year shall be not less than the percentage rates established by federal regulations for those safety-sensitive employees subject to random testing by federal regulations. The current random testing rate for drugs established by FTA equals 50 percent of the number of employees in the pool and the random testing rate for alcohol established by FTA equals ten percent of the number of employees in the pool. 
                  (3)	Each employee shall be in a pool from which the random selection is made. Each covered employee in the pool shall have an equal chance of selection each time the selections are made. Employees will remain in the pool and subject to selection, whether or not the employee has been previously tested. There is no discretion on the part of management in the selection and notification of the individuals who are to be tested. 
                  (4)	Covered transit employees that fall under the federal transit administration regulations will be included in one random pool maintained separately from the testing pool of employees that are included solely under local authority. 
                  (5)	Random tests can be conducted at any time during an employee's shift for drug testing. Alcohol random tests can be performed just before, during, or just after the performance of a safety sensitive duty. However, under the county's authority, a random alcohol test may be performed any time the covered employee is on duty. Testing can occur during the beginning, middle, or end of an employee's shift. 
                  (6)	Employees are required to proceed immediately to the collection site upon notification of their random selection. 
                  (o)	Return-to-duty testing. All employees who previously tested positive on a drug or alcohol test or refused a test, must test negative for drugs, alcohol (below 0.02 for alcohol), or both and be evaluated and released by the substance abuse professional before returning to work. For an initial positive drug test a return-to-duty drug test is required and an alcohol test is allowed. For an initial positive alcohol test a return-to-duty alcohol test is required and a drug test is allowed. Following the initial assessment, the SAP will recommend a course of rehabilitation unique to the individual. The SAP should schedule the return-to-duty test only when the employee is known to be drug-and alcohol-free and there is no risk to public safety. 
                  (p)	Follow-up testing. Employees will be required to undergo frequent, unannounced drug and alcohol testing following their return-to-duty. The follow-up testing will be performed for a period of one to five years with a minimum of six tests to be performed the first year. The frequency and duration of the follow-up tests (beyond the minimums) will be determined by the SAP reflecting the SAP's assessment of the employee's unique situation and recovery progress. Follow-up testing should be frequent enough to deter and/or detect a relapse. Follow-up testing is separate and in addition to the random, post-accident, reasonable suspicion and return-to-duty testing. 
                  (q)	Result of drug/alcohol test. Any employee that has a verified positive drug or alcohol test will be removed from his/her safety-sensitive position, informed of educational and rehabilitation programs available, and referred to a substance abuse professional (SAP) for assessment. No employee will be allowed to return to duty requiring the performance of safety-sensitive job functions without the approval of the SAP. 
                  A positive drug and/or alcohol test will also result in disciplinary action as specified herein. 
                  (1)	As soon as practicable after receiving notice of a verified positive drug test result, a confirmed alcohol test result, or a test refusal, the county drug and alcohol program manager will contact the employee's supervisor to have the employee cease performing any safety-sensitive function. 
                  (2)	The employee shall be referred to a substance abuse professional for an assessment. The SAP will evaluate each employee to determine what assistance, if any, the employee needs in resolving problems associated with prohibited drug use or alcohol misuse. 
                  (3)	Refusal to submit to a drug/alcohol test shall be considered a positive test result and a direct act of insubordination and shall result in termination. A test refusal includes the following circumstances. 
                  a.	An employee who consumes alcohol within eight hours following involvement in an accident without first having submitted to post-accident drug/alcohol tests. 
                  b.	An employee who leaves the scene of an accident without a legitimate explanation prior to submission to drug/alcohol tests. 
                  c.	An employee who is suspected of providing false information in connection with a drug test, or who is suspected of falsifying test results through tampering, contamination, adulteration, or substitution of a urine specimen. 
                  d.	An employee who provides an insufficient volume of urine specimen or breath sample without a valid medical explanation. 
                  e.	A verbal or written declaration, obstructive behavior, refusal to sign the required DOT drug and/or alcohol testing forms, or physical absence resulting in the inability to conduct the test within the specified time frame. 
                  f.	An employee whose urine sample has been verified by the MRO as substitute or adulterated.
                  g.	An employee fails to appear for any test within a reasonable time, as determined by the employer, after being directed to do so by the employer. 
                  h.	An employee fails to remain at the testing site until the testing process is complete.
                  i.	An employee fails to provide a urine specimen for any drug test required by Part 40 or DOT agency regulations. 
                  j.	An employee fails to permit the observation or monitoring of a specimen collection.
                  k.	An employee fails or declines to take a second test the employer or collector has directed you to take. 
                  l.	An employee fails to undergo a medical examination or evaluation, as directed by the MRO as part of the verification process, or as directed by the DER as part of the "shy bladder" procedures. 
                  m.	An employee fails to cooperate with any part of the testing process (e.g., refuse to empty pockets when so directed by the collector, behave in a confrontational way that disrupts the collection process). 
                  (4)	For the first instance of a verified positive test from a sample submitted as the result of a random, or reasonable suspicion drug/alcohol test (≥ 0.04 BAC), disciplinary action against the employee shall include: 
                  a.	Mandatory referral to substance abuse professional for assessment, formulation of a treatment plan, and execution of a return to work agreement. 
                  b.	Failure to execute, or remain compliant with the return-to-work agreement shall result in termination from the county employment. 
                  ▲ Compliance with the return-to-work agreement means that the employee has submitted to a drug/alcohol test immediately prior to returning to work; the result of that test is negative; in the judgment of the SAP the employee is cooperating with his/her SAP recommended treatment program; and, the employee has agreed to periodic unannounced follow-up testing as defined in subsection (p), of this policy; 
                  c.	Refusal to submit to a periodic unannounced follow-up drug/alcohol test shall be considered a direct act of insubordination and shall result in termination. 
                  d.	A periodic unannounced follow-up drug/alcohol test that results in a verified positive shall result in termination from county employment. 
                  (5)	The second instance of a verified positive drug or alcohol (≥ 0.04 BAC) test result from a sample submitted under the random, reasonable suspicion, return-to-duty, or follow-up drug/alcohol test provisions herein shall result in termination from county employment. 
                  (6)	A verified positive post-accident drug and/or alcohol (≥ 0.04) test shall result in termination. 
                  (7)	An alcohol test result of ≥0.02 to ≤ 0.039 BAC shall result in the removal of the employee from duty for eight hours or the remainder or the workday whichever is longer. The employee will not be allowed to return to safety-sensitive duty for his/her next shift until he/she submits to an alcohol test with a result of less than 0.02 BAC. If the employee has an alcohol test result of ≥ 0.02 to ≤ 0.039 two or more times within a six month period, the employee will be removed from duty and referred to the SAP for assessment and treatment consistent with subsection (q)(9) of this policy. 
                  (8)	The cost of any treatment or rehabilitation services will be paid directly by the employee or their insurance provider. The employee will be permitted to take accrued sick leave or administrative leave to participate in the SAP prescribed treatment program. If the employee has insufficient accrued leave, the employee shall be placed on leave without pay until the SAP has determined that the employee has successfully completed the required treatment program and releases him/her to return-to-duty. Any leave taken, either paid or unpaid, shall be considered leave taken under the Family and Medical Leave Act. 
                  (9)	In the instance of a self-referral or a management referral, disciplinary action against the employee shall include: 
                  a.	Mandatory referral to a substance abuse professional for assessment, formulation of a treatment plan, and execution of a return to work agreement. 
                  b.	Failure to execute, or remain compliant with the return-to-work agreement shall result in termination from county employment. 
                  ▲ Compliance with the return-to-work agreement means that the employee has submitted to a drug/alcohol test immediately prior to returning to work; the result of that test is negative; in the judgment of the SAP the employee is cooperating with his/her SAP recommended treatment program; and, the employee has agreed to periodic unannounced follow-up testing as defined in subsection (p), of this policy. 
                  c.	Refusal to submit to a periodic unannounced follow-up drug/alcohol test shall be considered a direct act of insubordination and shall result in termination. 
                  d.	A self-referral or management referral to the SAP that was not precipitated by a positive test result does not constitute a violation of the federal regulations and will not be considered as a positive test result in relation to the progressive discipline defined in subsection (q)(4) and (5), of this policy. 
                  e.	Periodic unannounced follow-up drug/alcohol test conducted as a result of a self-referral or management referral which results in a verified positive shall be considered a positive test result in relation to the progressive discipline defined in subsection (q)(4) and (5), of this policy. 
                  f.	A voluntary referral does not shield an employee from disciplinary action or guarantee employment with the county. 
                  g.	A voluntary referral does not shield an employee from the requirement to comply with drug and alcohol testing. 
                  (10)	Failure of an employee to report within five days a criminal drug statute conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace shall result in termination. 
                  (r)	Grievance and appeal. The consequences specified by 49 CFR Parts 653 and 654 for a positive test or test refusal is not subject to arbitration. 
                  (s)	Proper application of the policy. The county is dedicated to assuring fair and equitable application of this substance abuse policy. Therefore, supervisors/managers are required to use and apply all aspects of this policy in an unbiased and impartial manner. Any supervisor/manager who knowingly disregards the requirements of this policy, or who is found to deliberately misuse the policy in regard to subordinates, shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. 
                  (t)	Information disclosure. Drug/alcohol testing records shall be maintained by the county drug and alcohol program manager and, except as provided below or by law, the results of any drug/alcohol test shall not be disclosed without express written consent of the tested employee. 
                  (1)	The employee, upon written request, is entitled to obtain copies of any records pertaining to their use of prohibited drugs or misuse of alcohol including any drug or alcohol testing records. Covered employees have the right to gain access to any pertinent records such as equipment calibration records, and records of laboratory certifications. 
                  (2)	Records of a verified positive drug/alcohol test result shall be released to the county drug and alcohol program manager, department supervisor and personnel manager on a need to know basis. 
                  (3)	Records will be released to a subsequent employer only upon receipt of a written request from the employee. 
                  (4)	Records of an employee's drug/alcohol tests shall be released to the adjudicator in a grievance, lawsuit, or other proceeding initiated by or on behalf of the tested individual arising from the results of the drug/alcohol test. 
                  (5)	Records will be released to the national transportation safety board during an accident investigation. 
                  (6)	Records will be released to the DOT or any DOT agency with regulatory authority over the employer or any of its employees. 
                  (7)	Records will be released if requested by a federal, state or local safety agency with regulatory authority over the county or the employee. 
                  (8)	If a party seeks a court order to release a specimen or part of a specimen contrary to any provision of Part 40 necessary legal steps to contest the issuance of the order will be taken 
                  (u)	System contacts. Any questions regarding this policy or any other aspect of the substance abuse policy should be directed to the following individual(s).

                  Attachment B Alcohol Fact Sheet 
                  Alcohol is a socially acceptable drug that has been consumed throughout the world for centuries. It is considered a recreational beverage when consumed in moderation for enjoyment and relaxation during social gatherings. However, when consumed primarily for its physical and mood-altering effects, it is a substance of abuse. As a depressant, it slows down physical responses and progressively impairs mental functions. 
                  Signs and Symptoms of Use 
                  • Dulled mental processes. 
                  • Lack of coordination. 
                  • Odor of alcohol on breath. 
                  • Possible constricted pupils. 
                  • Sleepy or stuporous condition. 
                  • Slowed reaction rate. 
                  • Slurred speech. 
                  (Note: Except for the odor, these are general signs and symptoms of any depressant substance.) 
                  □ Health Effects 
                  The chronic consumption of alcohol (average of three servings per day of beer [12 ounces], whiskey [1 ounce], or wine [6 ounce glass]) over time may result in the following health hazards: 
                  • Decreased sexual functioning 
                  • Dependency (up to 10 percent of all people who drink alcohol become physically and/or mentally dependent on alcohol and can be termed "alcoholic") 
                  • Fatal liver diseases 
                  • Increased cancers of the mouth, tongue, pharynx, esophagus, rectum, breast, and malignant melanoma 
                  • Kidney disease 
                  • Pancreatitis 
                  • Spontaneous abortion and neonatal mortality 
                  • Ulcers 
                  • Birth defects (up to 54 percent of all birth defects are alcohol related). 
                  □ Social Issues 
                  • Two-thirds of all homicides are committed by people who drink prior to the crime. 
                  • Two to three percent of the driving population is legally drunk at any one time. This rate is doubled at night and on weekends. 
                  • Two-thirds of all Americans will be involved in an alcohol-related vehicle accident during their lifetimes. 
                  • The rate of separation and divorce in families with alcohol dependency problems is seven times the average. 
                  • Forty percent of family court cases are alcohol problem related. 
                  • Alcoholics are 15 times more likely to commit suicide than are other segments of the population. 
                  • More than 60 percent of burns, 40 percent of falls, 69 percent of boating accidents, and 76 percent of private aircraft accidents are alcohol related. 
                  □ The Annual Toll 
                  • 24,000 people will die on the highway due to the legally impaired driver. 
                  • 12,000 more will die on the highway due to the alcohol-affected driver. 
                  • 15,800 will die in non-highway accidents. 
                  • 30,000 will die due to alcohol-caused liver disease. 
                  • 10,000 will die due to alcohol-induced brain disease or suicide. 
                  • Up to another 125,000 will die due to alcohol-related conditions or accidents. 
                  □ Workplace Issues 
                  • It takes one hour for the average person (150 pounds) to process one serving of an alcoholic beverage from the body. 
                  • Impairment in coordination and judgment can be objectively measured with as little as two drinks in the body. 
                  • A person who is legally intoxicated is 6 times more likely to have an accident than a sober person.

                  Sec. 74-31. - Prior considerations. 
                  Prior to initial application for development of a proposed subdivision within the county, consideration should be given to the major issues and requirements which will impact the design and development of the subdivision and the resulting cost of construction. Such issues include, but are not limited to: 
                  (1)	Suitability of land. Land which is deemed by the planning commission to be unsuitable for development will be denied for development, or, the developer will be required to initiate or incorporate mitigating measures to render the land suitable for development. Land considered as unsuitable for development includes, but is not limited to: 
                  a.	Flooding. Land subject to flooding, deemed by observation to be located in floodplains, and land designated as flood prone as indicated on the FEMA Floodplain map of McDuffie County. 
                  b.	Wetlands. Land which is designated as wetlands by existing map resources or identified on-site by a qualified consultant. 
                  c.	Poor drainage. Land which is considered unsuitable due to poor drainage.
                  d.	Geologic/topographic conditions. Land which possess rock formations or outcroppings, and land having steep slopes, or land which may endanger health, life, or property. Land development which may aggravate erosion, increase flood hazard, or necessitate excessive expenditures of public funds for supply and maintenance of services. 
                  e.	Predetermined unsuitable. Land which other public agencies have investigated and found, in the best interest of the public, not suitable for the type of platting and development proposed. Such lands shall not be approved for subdivision unless adequate methods are formulated by the developer for meeting the problems created by subdivision of such land. 
                  f.	General. Land which is considered unsuitable due to scattered or premature subdivision of land which would endanger health, safety or property because of lack of, or adverse effect on, water supply, schools, proper drainage, transportation, other public services or public funds for the supply or maintenance of such services. 
                  (2)	Design costs. Developers with little or no prior experience in subdivision development will encounter significant engineering and surveying cost and time relating to the design, submittal, and applicable resubmittal of subdivision design plans. 
                  (3)	Land/improvements. Developers will encounter significant costs in acquiring the land for the subdivision, designing the subdivision to county design requirements, the purchase and installation of the subdivision infrastructure and improvements including paved roadways, sidewalks, municipal water and sewer, underground electrical service, street lights, green spaces/greenways, recreation areas, landscaping, and drainage facilities such as drop inlets, storm water piping and detention basins. 
                  (4)	Compliance fees. Developers will experience associated cost in complying with pertinent federal, state, and local regulations such as wetland mitigation, county review fees, state erosion and sediment control (EandS) review and fees, state/federal NPDES fees. 
                  (5)	Responsibility of costs. It shall be the responsibility of the owner or developer to underwrite the total cost of the construction of the subdivision development. The furnishing of performance bonding to gain early release of lots for sale, or other transfer of title, is prohibited.

                  Initially, and prior to the submittal of any preliminary plat, all subdividers or developers are required to meet with the director of the planning commission, director of public works, the county's environmental health specialist, and other applicable representatives to review the county's requirements for subdivision development. The subdivider/developer should submit a draft scaled sketch of the proposed subdivision along with data showing existing conditions within the site and in its vicinity and the proposed layout and development of the subdivision. It is not necessary to produce engineered plans at this time. No fee shall be charged for this informal consultation, and no formal application is anticipated. The informal consultation will cover the development and design requirements and issues applicable to the proposed development. After consultation, and upon approval by the planning commission, the owner/developer may draft and submit a preliminary plat as described below. 
                  (Ord. of 6-6-07, § 2.2)
                  Sec. 74-33. - Submittal of preliminary plat. 
                  (a)	Plat requirements and improvements. Prior to the submittal of a preliminary plat the subdivider/developer should first reference and become familiar with the zoning district design requirements found in the McDuffie County Land Development Code (zoning ordinance) for the zoning district in which the property is to be developed. The subdivider/developer is required to comply with those plat requirements noted herein which must be incorporated into the subdivision plans. 
                  (b)	Plan submittal. The subdivider/developer shall submit to the planning commission preliminary plat sets, the number of which shall be determined by the planning commission, along with a subdivision review fee in an amount as approved by the board of commissioners. The submittal of a preliminary plat to the planning commission for review neither constitutes an application for board review, nor conveys developmental rights to the subdivider/developer which are conveyed only upon approval of the preliminary plat by the board of commissioners. 
                  (c)	Plan review. At such time as the owner or developer submits to the planning commission a preliminary plat and any additional documentation as is required by the planning commission, and upon receipt of all applicable fees, the staff shall review the preliminary plat for conformity with the provisions of this chapter. The planning commission shall not accept an application for board review of a preliminary subdivision plan unless, in their judgment, it is found to comply with all applicable required plan elements and required subdivision improvements. The developer should note that the review of the preliminary plat by the planning commission does not include or cover the state's review undertaken by the local NRCS office for erosion and sedimentation control, or the review by the local environmental health specialists regarding the use of well and septic tanks. Upon completion of the planning commission review the planning commission staff shall inform the developer of the results of the review and any subsequent actions necessary to bring the plat into conformity with the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (d)	Application to planning commission board. 
                  (1)	Application without variance request(s). After review by the planning commission, should the preliminary plat be found to be in full compliance with the provisions of this chapter, without the necessity or intent of application by the developer for the granting of a variance, the review of the preliminary plat by the planning commission board shall neither be necessary nor required. The preliminary plat shall be forwarded by the planning commission directly to the board of commissioners for review. 
                  (2)	Application with variance request(s). After review by the planning commission, should the preliminary plat fail to be in full compliance with the provisions with this chapter, and it is the intent of the developer to apply for variances from the provisions of this chapter, the developer is required to first submit a preliminary plat of the subdivision which shall be in full compliance with the provisions of this chapter. The developer shall concurrently submit a second plat ("variance plat") which shall clearly indicate any variances or deviations which are being sought by the developer. After staff review of both plats the subdivider/developer will be directed to submit an application for preliminary plat review before the planning commission board, and the board of commissioners thereafter. Such application shall be made by such date as is designated as the application cut-off date for such board review. 
                  [Advertising] Applications for variances from the subdivision regulations shall require a public notice to be advertised in the local newspaper of general circulation not less than fifteen (15) days prior to such review in a form as approved by the planning commission. Unless otherwise authorized by the planning commission, notice of such application by on-site signage shall not be required. developers should contact the planning commission for guidance on the characteristics, design, and makeup of the "variance plat" sheet(s). 
                  (e)	Planning commission board action. Upon presentation to the planning commission board of the "compliant" and "variance" plats the planning commission staff shall report their findings, recommendations, and developer's requests for variances. The board shall review the application and thereafter recommend approval of the preliminary plat, with or without conditions, or denial of the preliminary plat. The board shall, in addition, have the opportunity of forwarding the plats to the board of commissioners without action or recommendation, or to postpone their decision. If action on a preliminary plat(s) is not taken by the planning commission board within 62 days from the date of the first hearing, the planning commission shall be considered as having taken "no action" whereupon the preliminary plat shall thereafter be forwarded to the board of commission for review. In addition to the 62 days, additional time may be granted for review of the plats if agreed upon by the applicant. The final action or recommendation of the planning commission board shall be conveyed to the county commission clerk who shall then place the subdivision plat on the agenda for review by the board of commissioners. 
                  (f)	Board of commissioner review. The board of commissioners upon review of the preliminary plat shall consider the action or recommendation of the planning commission board and any additional comments or information pertaining to the application. The board of commissioners, after giving due consideration to the application, shall render a final declaration as to the approval, with or without conditions, or denial of the plat. The board of commissioners shall, in addition, have the opportunity to postpone their decision. However, if final action is not taken by the board within 93 days of the date of the first hearing before the board of commissioners, the preliminary plat shall be considered as approved. In addition to the 93 days, additional time for review may be granted if agreed upon by the applicant. Approval of the preliminary plat by the board of commissioners shall constitute authorization for the subdivider to begin construction of the subdivision in accordance with the approved preliminary plat. Any deviation from the approved plan which is found during construction, or prior to approval of the final or as built plat, shall immediately be addressed by appropriate corrective action and approved by the planning commission or board of commissioners. The subdivider, subdivision owner or agent, shall not transfer, sell, or negotiate to sell any lots, areas, or phases of the subdivision, by reference or exhibition, except upon approval of the final or as built plat. Should the subdivision plat not be approved, the planning commission staff or board of commissioners shall notify the applicant setting forth the causes or reasons for such denial. 
                  (g)	Post approval actions. 
                  (1)	Preliminary plat status change. It shall be understood by the owner/developer that, upon approval of a preliminary plat, time is of the essence. Upon approval it is incumbent upon the subdivider/developer to begin development and construction of the subdivision in an expeditious manner. if it is determined by the planning commission that continuous development activity of or within the subdivision, or of a subdivision phase, has ceased, or is otherwise in a state of inactivity for a period of six (6) months, the planning commission is authorized to declare the status of the construction of the subdivision, and therefore the subdivision plat, as "inactive". Should a subdivision receive the status of "inactive" the developer shall be notified in writing by regular post, addressed to his/her last known address of record, that the preliminary plat and subdivision development is considered as inactive and that all development permits and approvals shall are considered suspended until such time as the developer or subdivider shall apply for a "reactivated" status. The procedure for reactivation shall be by application to and on such forms as prescribed by the planning commission. 
                  (2)	Reactivation and conformity. Prior to such time as the owner or developer shall apply for the status of "active" or "reactivated", the preliminary plat, and therefore the project addressed by said plat may be subject to being brought into conformity with any current standards of planning, construction, or engineered design at such time as the project and plat is considered for reactivation. 
                  (3)	Exemption (grandfathered plats). Subdivision preliminary plats which have received approval from the board of commissioners prior to the adoption of this chapter shall be considered as "grandfathered" and shall be exempt from the provisions of this section. 
                  (4)	Division prohibited. Upon adoption of this chapter by the board of commissioners, the further division of any lot, tract, or other parcel within any subdivision in McDuffie County is thereafter prohibited regardless of the date of development. 
                  (Ord. of 6-6-07, § 2.3)
                  Sec. 74-34. - Preliminary plat design elements. 
                  No preliminary plat shall be accepted by the planning commission unless the plat contains all of the following plat elements:

                  ARTICLE III. - GENERAL STANDARDS OF DESIGN 

                  Sec. 74-101. - Name designations. 
                  (a)	Name of subdivision. The name of each subdivision must have the approval of the planning commission. The subdivision name shall not duplicate nor closely approximate the name of an existing subdivision. 
                  (b)	Road/street names. Road/street names shall not duplicate existing street names, irrespective of the use of the suffixes such as street, avenue, boulevard, road, pike, drive, way, place, court, or other derivatives which must also be approved by the planning commission. The planning commission can assist the subdivider in avoiding duplication and in coordinating the names of streets. Approved street signs shall be placed at all intersections. Proposed streets which are continuations of, or are in alignment with existing streets shall bear the names of existing streets. Streets whose intersection or "curves" approximate a right angle 90° may, as directed by the planning commission, be required to be assigned a different name. 
                  (Ord. of 6-6-07, § 3.1)
                  Sec. 74-102. - Street classification. 
                  Streets and roads are classified in relation to the transportation function which they are to serve including the type, speed, and volume of traffic they will carry, and the required standards of design. The classifications of streets and roads as used in this chapter shall be as follows: 
                  (a)	Classification by traffic volume: 
                  (1)	Primary arteries (arterial). State and federal highways and those county highways which by design, traffic volume, and speed 55 m.p.h., are specifically designated as primary arteries by the planning commission. 
                  (2)	Secondary artery. County roads which are by traffic volume and speed 45—55 m.p.h. are designated as such by the planning commission. 
                  (3)	Collector roads/streets. Roads, as designated by the planning commission as having a lower traffic volume than an arterial road, and have a lower required speed 25—45 m.p.h. and serve to facilitate the movement of traffic between land service streets and arterial roads. 
                  (4)	Land service streets. Roads/streets which facilitate the movement of traffic directly from land lots to collector roads, and which require the lowest traffic speed 15—25 m.p.h. 
                  (b)	Classification by use: 
                  (1)	Residential. 
                  a.	Small lot subdivisions (proposed): (Zone: R-3) (Proposed: Lots = .40 acre, but generally < .50 acre with min. frontage of 75 feet). 
                  b.	Medium lot subdivisions (Zone R-2) (Refer to county zoning ordinance for R-2 dimensional/area requirements). 
                  c.	Large lot rural subdivisions (Zone R-1) (Refer to county zoning ordinance for R-1 dimensional/area requirements). 
                  (2)	Industrial. 
                  (3)	Commercial. 
                  (4)	Service drive. 
                  (Ord. of 6-6-07, § 3.2)
                  Sec. 74-103. - Relation to future road/street system. 
                  (a)	Location and width of streets and roads. The location and width of all streets and roads shall conform to the provisions of this chapter. 
                  (b)	Connection to existing streets. Existing streets that terminate at, adjoin, or traverse a proposed subdivision shall meet or exceed all requirements of this article prior to, or as a result of, approval of the preliminary plat. The public roads providing access to the subdivision shall be paved from the nearest paved road on the public road system to each subdivision entrance. It shall be the responsibility of the owner, developer, or subdivider to pave such roads unless otherwise approved by the board of commissioners. 
                  (c)	Layout of new streets. The proposed street system within a subdivision shall be determined by the planning commission to adequately balance the privacy of the future occupants with the free flow of traffic within the county, and to adequately provide for access for public safety by fire, police and emergency medical vehicles, and for school buses. In making such determination, satisfaction of the following requirements shall be considered by the planning commission: 
                  (1)	In the opinion of the planning commission where it is necessary to provide for street access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication and improvement of right-of-way to the boundary of such property. 
                  (2)	Unless approved otherwise by the planning commission, a subdivision shall provide a street connection to each public street that it adjoins, and shall provide direct or indirect continuity through the subdivision between each connection. 
                  (3)	The proposed street layout should be designed to minimize cut and fill within the right-of-way to provide better access to the subdivision lots. The design should also minimize the area of tree removal required for installation of streets, utilities and drainage features in order to reduce the number of large trees removed during construction. 
                  (d)	Interval of intersection with arteries. Subdivision streets which intersect a county arterial road shall do so at intervals not less than the following: 
                  (1)	Primary artery, 1,000 feet;
                  (2)	Secondary artery, 600 feet.
                  (e)	Large parcels. When land is subdivided into parcels larger than ordinary building lots, such parcels should be arranged so as to allow for the opening of streets in the future.

                  Sec. 74-104. - Street design. 
                  (a)	Width of street right-of-way. The minimum width of right-of-way measured from lot line to lot line shall be as follows: 

                   
                  [Notes:] 
                  1. Or greater width as may be required by the planning commission. 
                  2. Requires prior approval of the planning commission staff. 
                  3. Cul-de-sacs: R/W radius - 50 feet 
                  4. Cul-de-sacs: R/W radius - 60 feet 
                  (b)	Minimum width of pavement. The width of pavement, or path of travel, as measured from the front side of the gutter, shall be as follows: 

                   
                  [Notes:] 
                  1.Or greater width as may be required by the planning commission. 
                  2.Requires prior approval of the planning commission staff. 
                  3.Cul-de-sacs: 40-foot Radius 
                  4.Cul-de-sacs: 50-foot Radius 
                  (c)	Vertical alignment of streets. 
                  (1)	Grades on arteries, collectors and industrial land service streets shall not exceed seven percent; grades on commercial land service streets shall not exceed ten percent; grades on residential land service streets shall not exceed ten percent; all curbed and paved raised edge streets shall have a minimum grade of one percent. 
                  (2)	All changes in grade shall be connected by a vertical curve constructed so as to afford a minimum sight distance, which shall be measured from the driver's eyes, which are assumed to be 3¾ feet above the pavement surface, to an object six inches high on the pavement. The minimum sight distance shall be the minimum stopping sight distance for the rated speed of the street as follows: 

                   
                  (d)	Horizontal alignment of streets. 
                  (1)	A tangent of at least 100 feet in length shall be introduced between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets. 
                  (2)	Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than the minimum stopping sight distance set forth in this section of the street intersected shall not be allowed. 
                  (3)	All streets shall intersect at right angles. Such intersecting streets shall continue as perpendicular from the center point of the intersection for not less than the minimum stopping sight distance for their respective rated speeds in accordance with this section. 
                  (4)	Right-of-way lines at street intersections shall have a radius of curvature of not less than 20 feet. Wherever necessary to permit the construction of a curb having a desirable radius without curtailing the sidewalk at a street corner to less than normal width, the street right-of-way line at such street corner shall be rounded or otherwise set back sufficiently to permit such construction. 
                  (5)	Where a deflection angle of more than ten degrees in the alignment of a street occurs, the radius of curvature of the centerline of such street shall be not less than the following: 

                   
                  [Notes:] 
                  1. The planning commission may approve a 50-foot curvature to make more efficient use of land. 
                  (e)	Service drives. Service drives or alleys shall be provided to the rear of all lots used for business purposes, and shall not be provided in residential uses, except where the subdivider produces evidence satisfactory to the planning commission of the need for alleys or service drives, such as subdividing adjacent to an artery, or where specifically required by the planning commission. 
                  (f)	Cul-de-sacs. 
                  (1)	Cul-de-sacs will not be permitted as a design substitute for a connected or looped street, block street pattern or grid system. 
                  (2)	Cul-de-sacs shall be redesigned and connected into a continuous or looped street should the straight linear distance separation be less than 600 feet between cul-de-sacs, or a cul-de-sac and an existing or proposed street, as measured from the nearest right-of-way of each. 
                  (3)	Cul-de-sacs shall not be more than 1,000 feet long, nor less than 300 feet long, unless necessitated by topographic or other conditions or otherwise approved by the planning commission. 
                  (g)	Courts. Where street pavement and right-of-ways deviate from a straight right-of-way into a semi-circle set off to the side of the road/street, often named as a "court", the design of such court shall not exceed the dimensions of one-half of the dimensional requirements of a cul-de-sac as referenced in section 74-104. Excessive paved areas within courts will not be permitted. The entry and exit curb radii shall be of suitable length to afford ease of entry and exit.

                  Sec. 74-106. - Blocks. 
                  (a)	Length. Subdivisions employing a street block design shall have blocks which shall not be less than 400 feet, nor more than 1,200 feet in length, except as the planning commission considers necessary to secure efficient use of land or desired features of street patterns. In blocks greater than 800 feet in length, the planning commission may require one or more pedestrian easements of not less than ten feet in width which are paved, or are of suitable material, and which extend entirely through the block. (Also, see section 74-108(b)(2)). 
                  (b)	Width. Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two rows of lots, except where a lot backs up to an arterial road/street, in which case, the planning commission may approve a single row of lots.

Side lot lines shall be at or near right angles to right-of-ways. Lot lines which protruding excessively into adjacent lots will not be approved. With the exception of lot lines approximating the center line of waterways or shorelines of water bodies, excessive irregular lot angles may not be approved. 
                  (c)	Minimum lot dimensions and areas. 
                  (1)	The size and shape of lots shall meet the minimum standards set forth in the county's zoning regulations. Orientation of lots shall be such as the planning commission deems appropriate for the use contemplated, type of water supply and sewage disposal, soil characteristics, improvements, and relation to the street system. 
                  (2)	The minimum depths of building setback lines for lots platted for all purposes shall be subject to the provisions of the county zoning regulations, as well as the following: 
                  a.	Wherever fill is proposed to raise land, the building setback line shall be located not less than 25 feet from the outer edge of the fill. The developer or contractor shall assure that such fill shall be compacted to the degree of suitability for it use. At the discretion of the planning commission, a compaction test by a certified testing company may be required to verify suitable compaction. Such tests shall be at the expense of the contractor or developer, or other party. 
                  b.	To prevent infringement of sight lines at intersections, unless otherwise approved by the zoning code, the building setback distances for corner lots shall be the minimum building setbacks from the centerline of both roads/streets. 
                  (3)	Properties reserved or platted for alternate or dissimilar use (commercial, industrial, multi-family, townhouse, etc) or purposes shall be adequate in size to provide for the off-street service and parking facilities required by the type of use and development contemplated. Platting of individual lots should be avoided in favor of an overall design of the land to be used for such purposes. Land shall not be platted for such uses unless the subdivider can demonstrate to the planning commission: 
                  a.	A site arrangement that prevents undue interference with through traffic. Alternate uses shall utilize a single collector for all heavy traffic between the area and the general system of streets and roads. Parcels for such uses shall be oriented at right angles with the collector and with adjacent railroads; 
                  b.	An on-site parking area for each alternate use;
                  c.	A mitigating buffer (vegetative buffer, berm, fencing, etc) against any adverse effects on any present or future adjacent residences; and 
                  d.	A parcel size sufficient in area to allow future expansion.
                  (d)	Dual frontage lots. 
                  (1)	Dual frontage lots in the interior blocks of a subdivision should be avoided except where specifically required by the planning commission to provide separation of residential development from arterial and collector roads or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation of property. 
                  (2)	Dual frontage lots shall be permitted where such rear yards abut an existing public road, but where access from the rear yard to the public road is prohibited. 
                  (3)	An easement to the county may be required which extends along the entire right-of-way of the public road/street (see subsection (2), above), across which there shall be no right of access, and screening shall be provided along the right-of-way abutting such public road as follows: 
                  a.	In the R-1, residential-agricultural zoning district, an easement of 30 feet in width in which the existing vegetation shall be left undisturbed, but may be supplemented with additional plantings. 
                  b.	In all other residential zoning districts, the easement shall constitute a vegetative buffer the width of which shall not be less than the minimum front building setback from the centerline of the public road/street as is required by the zoning district in which it is located, or not less than 25 feet in width if it creates an opaque soil berm screen to a height of not less than six feet. 
                  c.	The continued maintenance of such easements shall be the responsibility of the property owner, owner or developer of the subdivision, approved homeowner's association, or other party as approve by the planning commission or county. 
                  d.	All buffer and landscaped areas are subject to the review and approval of the planning commission. Existing trees with ten inches diameter (dch—diameter at chest height) or greater shall not be removed unless removal is approved by the planning commission to prevent danger due to injury or disease to the tree. Modifications may be approved by the planning commission to achieve equivalent screening results depending on the topography, orientation or other physical factors of the site. 
                  (e)	Lot entrances/exits. 
                  (1)	All lots within subdivisions shall have one entrance accessing each lot unless such lots are of sufficient width to accommodate a second access. Corner lots may have a second access providing each access is a minimum of 200 feet from the front corner juncture of the lot's right-of-way, or otherwise approved by the planning commission. 
                  (2)	All subdivision lot access shall be from interior subdivision streets.

                  ARTICLE IV. - MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR IMPROVEMENTS 

                  Sec. 74-186. - Improvements required and shown. 
                  In addition to the other requirements imposed by this chapter, all subdivision required improvements referenced below shall be incorporated into all subdivisions. Only those improvements indicated below by an "(R)" are required to be shown on the preliminary plat before such plat shall be considered for staff review, or application for board review. 
                  (Ord. of 6-6-07, § 4.1)
                  Sec. 74-187. - Required improvements. 
                  Subdivision improvements which are subject to section 74-186, immediately above include, but are not limited to, the following: 
                  (a)	Lot markers. In addition to the development's outer perimeter, all lot boundaries shall be marked with iron pipes, pins, or rebar not less than one-half inch in diameter and not less than twenty-four inches long, and shall be driven so as to be flush with the finished grade. Prior to submittal of a final or as built plat all lot lines at their juncture with the right-of-way shall be indicated with a one-inch × two inches or greater wooden posts or three inches (diameter) or greater white PVC pipe, or other marker as approved by the planning commission, which shall clearly indicate the lot number. Such marker shall extend a minimum of 24 inches above common grade. Lot markers located in the center of the front property line are not acceptable. 
                  (b)	Storm drainage (R). An adequate drainage system, including, but not limited to pipes, culverts, drains, inlets, headwalls, bridges and detention/retention facilities, shall be provided as engineered for the proper drainage and detention/retention of all surface water. All engineered storm drainage systems shall be approved before such systems may be installed and before preliminary and final plat approval will be issued by the planning commission. 
                  (c)	Street development. Every subdivision lot or parcel shall have access to a street system which shall be designed and engineered according to the design criteria contained in this chapter, article III herein, and such criteria as referenced below. 
                  (1)	Preparation of right-of-way. The full width of all roadways shall be prepared so that pavement, sidewalks, and other required improvements may be constructed in such a manner that future extension of additional utilities or street improvements will not damage yards of abutting property. Abutting property shall be suitably sloped to the right-of-way line. Due regard shall be shown for desirable trees not impairing visibility. 
                  (2)	Preparation of subgrade. Before grading is started, the entire area to be paved shall first be cleared of all stumps, roots, brush and other objectionable materials. In all areas to be graded or filled, the subdivider shall stockpile the topsoil to be spread later in all disturbed areas not paved. 
                  (3)	Protection of banks. Immediately after grading, filling, and re-spreading of topsoil, all areas of disturbed soil shall be fertilized, seeded, sodded, or otherwise appropriately treated with suitable vegetative cover to retard erosion. The stabilization as evidenced by an adequate stand of grass on all right-of-ways shall be obtained to the satisfaction of the director of public works before approval of the final plat. 
                  (4)	Roadway base. Roadway base material and compaction shall conform to the county's specifications for such, and shall be approved by the director of public works. 
                  (5)	Curb-and-gutter and paving (R). All new streets shall be surfaced by the developer with paving materials as required by county specifications regarding street paving and surface materials. Concrete curbs and gutters shall be required on all new streets and shall be constructed by the subdivision developer in accordance with the county's specifications for curbs and gutters available from the office of the director of public works. Where a subdivision abuts an existing state or county road, the developer shall be required to extend the subdivision's road improvements (paved roadway, curb/gutter, etc) out to, and to improve such public road in compliance with the minimum requirements of this chapter. 
                  (6)	New streets (R). The preparation and development of all new roads shall comply with the county's specifications herein, and shall be approved by the county before such streets may be developed and accepted by the county. 
                  (7)	Turn lanes (R). Center turn lanes may be required at entrances into residential, industrial, and commercial developments which front on arterial streets. Turn lanes shall be 12 feet in width for a minimum distance of 200 feet which distance shall be measured from the intersection of the right-of-way lines. Contact the planning commission for analysis of county roadway at proposed subdivision entrance(s) and the requirements for turn lanes. 
                  (8)	Acel/decel lanes (R). Acel/decal lanes shall be required for all subdivision entrances fronting a primary or secondary arterial roadway, or what is determined by the planning commission to be a major collector road or street of increased speed and traffic flow. Acel/decal lanes shall be constructed to the design criteria as required by the public works director. 
                  (9)	Number of entrances (R). To facilitate ease of traffic, every subdivision having frontage greater than 2,000 feet on an existing public roadway, or has frontage on multiple county roadways, may be required to provide more than one entrance to such subdivision. 
                  (d)	Sidewalks (R). Concrete sidewalks shall be required for all residential subdivisions, multi-family and PUD developments. Sidewalks may be required in industrial and commercial developments depending on the characteristics and density of the development. Sidewalks shall be constructed on both sides of the streets to the county's design standards as found in the office of the director of public works and shall be four feet in width and four inches in depth. For standard (upright) curb and gutter, the sidewalk may join or abut the back side of the curb. For roll-top curbing, the front (street) edge of the sidewalk shall be placed not closer than five feet from the back side of the curb. To stabilize the edges of the sidewalk and curbing, turf grass shall be placed in the five-foot area between the back of the curbing and the front edge of the sidewalk. For standard curbing with abutting sidewalk, a single row of turf shall be placed on the back side of the sidewalk. Sidewalks shall not be located less than one-foot from all front property lines to prevent interference or encroachment by fencing, walls, hedges or other plantings or structures placed on the property line at a later date. At street corners and other required locations, sidewalk handicap ramps shall be installed. In addition to interior subdivision sidewalks, sidewalks along exterior roadways or other public right-of-ways shall also be required where deemed by the planning commission as an integral part of a pedestrian traffic system within a one-mile radius of existing or planned schools, neighborhood recreation, or commercial areas, or other public places, and for continuation of existing sidewalks. 
                  (e)	Site improvements. Banks which infringe on sight lines at intersections shall be appropriately graded to correct the deficiency. Wherever grading or filling occurs on lots within the subdivision, the subdivider shall first stockpile the topsoil from the affected areas immediately after grading and filling, and shall redistribute to areas of disturbed soil, sufficient topsoil to support growth of lawn grass and other vegetation, and shall immediately seed such areas with appropriate vegetative cover to prevent erosion, silting of streams and other damages. Due regard shall be shown for such desirable trees which are already on the site, and grading and filling should be planned to preserve as many of such trees possible; however, no retained planting shall infringe on sight lines at intersections. If trees are planted by the subdivider, they shall be located five feet inside or behind property lines where they are less subject to injury, decrease the chances of motor accidents and enjoy more favorable conditions for growth. If trees are to be planted within a planting strip in the right-of-way, the proposed locations and species of such trees to be used must be submitted for the planning commission's approval since the public inherits the care and maintenance of such trees. Where land is platted or reserved for commercial or industrial use bordering or across from residential lots, a suitable buffer planting of trees and shrubs which are approved by the planning commission shall be required, such trees and shrubs shall not infringe on sight lines at intersections where planted. 
                  (f)	Sanitary sewerage (R). 
                  (1)	All subdivisions (including any/all phases) shall be connected to an existing public sewerage system if service is available within the following distances.

                  1 As measured from the closest water main to the nearest subdivision perimeter property line. 
                  (2)	Future water lines. When it has been confirmed that the county will be installing water lines within certain areas of the county, any new subdivisions developed within those area may be required by the planning commission or board of commissioners to install capped "dry lines" within the development. Dry lines shall be required to tap into the new county water line upon installation and activation. 
                  (3)	Private water wells. Where public water is not available, private water wells shall be permitted as approved by the county health officer and other agencies having jurisdiction over such matters. 
                  (4)	Community water systems. Private community or group water systems are prohibited. 
                  (5)	Fire hydrants. Fire hydrants shall be provided as engineered with a separation of not greater than 1,000 feet for residential use and 500 feet for commercial and industrial use. Final grading around fire hydrants shall not be less than 36 inches below the center of the largest horizontal supply hub of the hydrant with the uniform grade extending outward from the hydrant for a radius of not less than six feet. Hydrant grading requirement shall also include hub clearance from such subdivision improvements as the top side of any curbing, sidewalks, etc. 
                  (h)	Entrance landscaping (R). All entrances into subdivisions shall be decoratively landscaped according to a landscaping plan submitted by the owner or developer which shall be reviewed and approved by the planning commission. Such plan shall incorporate the use of ornamental trees, shrubs, and low growth ground cover in an acceptable ratio or coverage to prevent the coverage from appearing sparse. The planting of annual flowers is recommended. The planting of shade trees is optional and shall be approved by the planning commission based upon consideration of root growth interference with underground utilities, possible damage to curb and gutter and roadways, and annual leaf cleanup and future maintenance. The size and location of the landscaped area shall not be less than 189 square feet in area on each side of the subdivision entrance, and shall be located at the immediate entrance to the subdivision in an area configuration as approved by the planning commission. 
                  (i)	Entrance sign (R).

                  Sec. 74-251. - Assurance of continued maintenance. 
                  To assure the proper installation and maintenance of all subdivision improvements prior to McDuffie County accepting same, the following requirements shall be met. 
                  (a)	Developer maintenance period. McDuffie County shall not accept any subdivision roadways, right-of-ways, or other subdivision improvements for a period of not less than 12 months from the date that all subdivision improvements have been initially completed, inspected, and approved as evidenced by approval of the final plat. If approved, the public works director shall notify the owner or developer of same in writing at which time the developer maintenance period shall commence. In addition to the minimum one year period developer maintenance period requirement, the county may require that 60 percent of the lots within the subdivision, or subdivision phase, have fully constructed residential structures in place prior to consideration of the acceptance or dedication of any subdivision improvements. The developer maintenance period and the 60 percent "built-out" requirement will allow for sufficient time to detect any hidden defects in the subdivision improvements which are not readily identifiable at the time of initial inspection of the improvements, and will assure that all subdivision improvements will be properly maintained. The initial 12-month developer maintenance period may be extended at the option of the county board of commissioners. 
                  [Bond]The board of commissioners may require the developer/owner to maintain in force a performance bonding securing such subdivision improvements. 
                  (b)	Maintenance assurance. The subdivision developer or owner shall be required to keep all subdivision roadways, right-of-ways, required traffic signs and signals, and all other subdivision improvements in good repair during the developer maintenance period, and any extensions thereof. As an assurance of such continued maintenance the planning commission may designate a lot or lots which shall be held "in abeyance" (not eligible for sale or issuance of building permits) until the owner or developer is in full compliance with the intent and conditions of the developer maintenance period. 
                  (Ord. of 6-6-07, § 6.1)
                  Sec. 74-252. - Dedication of subdivision improvements. 
                  After the developer maintenance period and any applicable required extensions have expired, or terminated upon approval of the county, the subdivision developer or owner shall request the public works director, planning commission, and other applicable departments to make a final inspection of all subdivision improvements. Should any defects exist, they shall be immediately remedied after which a final inspection shall again be requested. Upon inspection approval the subdivision owner or developer shall request in writing that all subdivision improvements be dedicated to, and accepted by the McDuffie County Board of Commissioners. Upon acceptance by the board of commissioners, all lots being held in abeyance shall be released for construction whereupon the subdivision owner or developer shall be relieved of future maintenance and assurances related to all subdivision improvements.

                  Sec. 74-253. - Variances. 
                  (a)	Board variances. The planning commission board may recommend, and, the board of commissioners may authorize variances from the requirements and minimum design standards contained in this chapter provided the subdivider submits to the planning commission a specific request for such which shall include specific and detailed justifications why such variance(s) should be granted, and shows to the satisfaction of the boards that strict compliance to these requirements would cause an overwhelming burden of hardship to the developer. The recommending of any variances by the planning commission board, and the granting as any variance by the board of commissioners shall be stated in the minutes of the of the respective board meeting with the reasons for which the departure was justified and the conditions under which such variance was granted. Mere inconvenience, financial or otherwise, shall not constitute authorization for an application for a variance. 
                  (1)	Variance plat. At such time as a preliminary plat is authorized to be submitted for review, if it is the intent of the developer to seek variances from the required subdivision improvements as referenced in article IV, a second or "variance plat" shall be drafted showing the design of the subdivision incorporating such requested variances. 
                  (b)	Administrative variances. The director of the planning commission is hereby authorized to grant variances in the dimensional requirements of this chapter provided the purpose and intent of this chapter is maintained.

                  Editor's note— A resolution adopted July 18, 1995, did not specifically amend this Code; hence, codification of said resolution as § 78-72 herein was at the editor's discretion. 
                  Sec. 78-73. - Conservation use assessment. 
                  In accordance with O.C.G.A. § 48-5-7.4(a)(3), McDuffie County hereby sets the minimum number of acres as a condition for qualifying for conservation use assessment for ad valorem tax purposes at ten acres for a single tract; provided however, that a tract of less than ten acres may qualify for current use assessment if it is contiguous to and used in conjunction with another tract receiving current use assessment that is owned by the same applicant or applicants. This minimum shall apply to all new covenants entering into for the tax year 2012 and thereafter. 
                  Renewal covenants may be grandfathered into the program contingent upon approval by the board of assessors so long as the primary use of the property is agricultural use and is owned by the original owner of the covenant. Any changes made to the property or ownership will result in the property being considered a new covenant and not a renewal and have to meet the ten-acre-minimum requirement. This minimum shall apply to all renewal covenants as deemed necessary for the year 2012 and thereafter.

                  Editor's note—An ordinance adopted Feb. 4, 1998(2), did not specifically amend this Code; hence, codification of §§ 1—16 and 19 of said ordinance as §§ 86-21—86-37 herein was at the editor's discretion. See the history note following each section for further derivation thereof.

                  Sec. 86-21. - Findings and purpose. 
                  (a)	Findings of fact: In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and to provide for a healthy economic climate within McDuffie County and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of the public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted development. Land disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation which threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxicants, nutrients, and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport, and storage of hazardous or toxic materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies. 
                  (b)	Purpose: The purpose of this article is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of McDuffie County; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This article shall apply to the Usry Pond Watershed, located within the jurisdiction of unincorporated McDuffie County.
