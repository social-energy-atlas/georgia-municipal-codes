PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of Dawson County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances and resolutions adopted by the governing authority of the county. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance or resolution included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Index 
                  The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments

                  --- (1) --- 
                  Editor's note— Printed in this article is 1995 Ga. Laws (Act No. 73), page 3689, part 2. Amendments are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions.

Section catchlines have been editorially supplied. In addition, the title of the act and the enacting clause have been deleted. Other additions for clarity are indicated by brackets. 

                  Sec. 2-1. - Created; status as governing authority. 
                  There is created the Board of Commissioners of Dawson County to be elected and organized as provided for in this Act. The board of commissioners shall be the successor to the Office of Commissioner of Dawson County and shall continue to have the obligations and liabilities of the Commissioner of Dawson County as existed immediately prior to January 1, 1997. The board of commissioners shall constitute the governing authority of Dawson County and shall exercise the powers, duties, and responsibilities vested in and upon said officers by the provisions of this Act. The term "board," whenever used in this Act, shall mean the Board of Commissioners of Dawson County, including the chairperson and all members. 
                  Sec. 2-2. - Composition. 
                  (a)  The Board of Commissioners of Dawson County shall consist of a chairperson and four district commissioners. The four district commissioners shall be residents of their respective commissioner districts described in subsection (b) of this section, but shall be elected by the electors of the entire county as provided in section 2-3 of this Act. The chairperson shall be elected at large as provided in section 2-3 of this Act. 
                  (b)  For purposes of electing members of the board of commissioners, other than the chairperson, Dawson County is divided into four commissioner districts. One member of the board shall be elected from each such district. The four commissioner districts shall be and correspond to those four numbered districts described in and attached to and made a part of this Act and further identified as Plan Name: dawccsb3 Plan Type: Local User: Staff Administrator: Dawson. 
                  (c)  When used in such attachment, the terms "tract" and "block group" (BG) shall mean and describe the same geographical boundaries as provided in the report of the Bureau of the Census for the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. The separate numeric designations in a tract description which are underneath a BG heading shall mean and describe individual blocks within a block group as provided in the report of the Bureau of the Census for the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. Any part of Dawson County which is not included in any such district described in that attachment shall be included within that district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. Any part of Dawson County which is described in that attachment as being in a particular district shall nevertheless not be included within such district if such part is not contiguous to such district. Such noncontiguous part shall instead be included within that district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. Except as otherwise provided in the description of any commissioner district, whenever the description of such district refers to a named city, it shall mean the geographical boundaries of that city as shown on the census map for the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. 
                  (c.1)  Commissioner districts 1, 2, 3, and 4, as they exist immediately prior to the effective date of this Act, shall continue to be designated as commissioner districts 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, but as newly described under this Act, and on and after the effective date of this Act, such members of the board serving from those former commissioner districts shall be deemed to be serving from and representing their respective districts as newly described under this Act. 
                  (2002 Ga. Laws (Act No. 533), page 4330, § 1) 
                  Sec. 2-3. - Persons eligible to hold office. 
                  (a)  No person shall be a member of the board if that person is ineligible for such office pursuant to Code Section 45-2-1 of the O.C.G.A. [O.C.G.A. § 45-2-1 et seq.] or any other general law. 
                  (b)  In order to be elected as a member of the board from a commissioner district, a person must be 21 years of age or older, must have resided in that district for at least 12 months prior to election thereto, and must receive a majority of the votes cast for that office by the electors of the entire county. At the time of qualifying for election as a member of the board from a commissioner district, each candidate for such office shall specify the commissioner district for which that person is a candidate. A person elected as a member of the board from a commissioner district must continue to reside in that district during that person's term of office or that office shall thereupon become vacant. 
                  (c)  The chairperson of the board must be 25 years of age or older, must have resided in Dawson County for at least 12 months prior to election to such office, may reside anywhere within Dawson County, and must receive a majority of the votes cast for such office by the electors of the entire county.

                  Sec. 2-4. - Terms of office and manner of election. 
                  (a)  The first chairperson and members of the Board of Commissioners of Dawson County shall be elected at the statewide general election which shall be conducted on the Tuesday next following the first Monday in November 1996. Those members of the board elected thereto from commissioner districts 1 and 3 in 1996 shall take office on the first day of January immediately following that election and shall serve for initial terms of office which expire December 31, 1998, and upon the election and qualification of their respective successors. The chairperson and those members of the board elected thereto from commissioner districts 2 and 4 in 1996 shall take office on the first day of January immediately following that election and shall serve for initial terms of office which expire December 31, 2000, and upon the election and qualification of their respective successors. Those and all future successors to the chairperson and members of the board whose terms of office are to expire shall be elected at the statewide general election immediately preceding the expiration of such terms, shall take office on the first day of January immediately following that election, and shall serve for terms of office of four years. Members of the board shall serve for the terms of office specified therefor in this subsection and until their respective successors are elected and qualified. 
                  (b)  The chairperson and all members of the board who are elected thereto shall be nominated and elected in accordance with Chapter 2 of Title 21 of the O.C.G.A. [O.C.G.A. § 21-2-1 et seq.], the "Georgia Election Code." 
                  (c)  The Commissioner of Dawson County who is in office on January 1, 1996, or any person filling a vacancy in such office, shall serve out the remainder of that person's term of office until the regular expiration of the term of office on December 31, 1996. 
                  Sec. 2-5. - Filling of vacancies. 
                  (a)  In the event of a vacancy occurring on or after January 1, 1997, in the membership of the board, whether the vacancy is in the office of chairperson or any other member, for any reason other than expiration of term, that vacancy shall be filled as provided in this section. 
                  (b)  In the event a vacancy occurs on the board of commissioners when at least 180 days remain in the unexpired term of office, the election [of] Superintendent of Dawson County, within 15 days after the vacancy occurs, shall issue the call for a special election to fill the vacancy for the unexpired term. Such special election shall be called and conducted as provided in Chapter 2 of Title 21 of the O.C.G.A., the "Georgia Election Code," [O.C.G.A. § 21-2-1 et seq.] as now or hereafter amended. Any person elected in a special election to fill such a vacancy shall take office immediately upon certification of the results of such special election and qualification. If such vacancy is in the office of chairperson of the board of commissioners, the vice chairperson of the board shall exercise the powers and duties of the chairperson for the period beginning on the date the vacancy occurs and ending on the date the successor chairperson takes office for the unexpired term following the special election provided for in this subsection. 
                  (c)  In the event a vacancy occurs on the board of commissioners when less than 180 days remain in the unexpired term of office, the remaining members of the board of commissioners shall appoint a qualified person to fill the vacancy for the unexpired term. Any person appointed by the board to fill a vacancy as provided in this subsection shall possess the residency and other qualifications required for the office and shall take office immediately upon appointment and qualification. If such vacancy is in the office of chairperson of the board of commissioners, the vice chairperson of the board shall exercise the powers and duties of the chairperson for the period beginning on the date the vacancy occurs and ending on the date the successor chairperson takes office for the unexpired term following his appointment as provided for in this subsection. 
                  (d)  A vice chairperson serving as chairperson shall not be authorized to vote as a member of the board of commissioners during such service unless the vice chairperson's vote would affect the outcome of any vote or issue before the board. 
                  Sec. 2-6. - Oath and bond. 
                  Before entering upon the discharge of their duties, the chairperson and commissioners shall subscribe an oath before the judge of the probate court of said county for the true and faithful performance of their duties and that they are not the holders of any public funds unaccounted for. In addition, the chairperson and each commissioner shall further give a satisfactory surety bond to the judge of the probate court of the county and payable to the judge of the probate court or that judge's successor in office and filed in the office of the judge of the probate court, in the sum of $10,000.00, conditioned upon the faithful performance of the duties of the office. The costs of said bonds shall be paid out of the county treasury. 
                  Sec. 2-7. - Compensation. 
                  (a)  Commissioners, other than the chairperson, shall be paid a salary in accordance with the Summary of Compensation Recommendations attached to the Ordinance adopted on June 4, 2015 and shown below in subsection (d). Such compensation shall be paid in equal monthly installments from the funds of Dawson County. 
                  (b)  The chairperson shall serve in such capacity on a part-time basis and shall be paid a salary in accordance with the Summary of Compensation Recommendations attached to the Ordinance adopted on June 4, 2015 and shown below in subsection (d). Such compensation shall be paid in equal monthly installments from the funds of Dawson County. 
                  (c)  The chairperson and the commissioners may be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in carrying out their duties. Expenses may be reimbursed only after the submission of receipts for said expenses to the county clerk and the approval by majority vote of the board of commissioners at a regularly scheduled meeting. The chairperson and commissioners shall be entitled to compensation for serving on any other boards or authorities for which their membership is provided by law. 
                  (d)  The compensation referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of this section is as follows: 

                   
                  Cost of Living Adjustments to the Base Salary and the Local Incentive Supplements shall apply as provided in the Georgia Code. Cost of Living Adjustment shall apply to the incentive payments, but shall not apply to the called meeting fees. 
                  The commission shall review its compensation levels every four years approximately 18 months before the general election in which the commission chair is elected. Comparison of compensation levels with other counties of like characteristics remains the best measure of fair market value. The data is readily available and a citizen committee could be appointed to recommend adjustments or changes to the county's compensation plan. In the intervening years, the Georgia legislature will apply cost of living adjustments to the base salary and the same rates of adjustment should apply to the local supplement base. The incentive payments should be subjected to COLAs as well. COLAs for meeting fees should not be subjected to COLAs. 
                  (Ord. of 2-16-2006, §§ I, II; Ord. of 6-4-2015(1), § I(Exh. A)) 
                  Editor's note— Per instructions of the County Attorney dated March 2, 2011, the salary recommendations attached to the resolution adopted on February 16, 2006, have been included in the above section. The editors have reworded subsections (a) and (b) accordingly. 
                  Sec. 2-8. - Vice chairperson. 
                  At the first regular meeting of each year, the board of commissioners shall elect from its members a vice chairperson. In the event of death, disqualification, or resignation of the chairperson, the vice chairperson shall perform the duties and exercise the authority of the chairperson until a new chairperson is chosen as provided in this Act. The vice chairperson shall preside at meetings of the board of commissioners in the absence of the chairperson and shall serve for the calendar year in which elected. In the event of a vacancy in the office of vice chairperson, the board of commissioners shall elect a new vice chairperson to serve for the remainder of the calendar year. 
                  Sec. 2-9. - Meetings. 
                  The board of commissioners shall hold two regular meetings each month at the county seat, which meetings shall be open to the public. The time, date, and place of the meetings shall be determined by the board in the first meeting of the year.

Any tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall not exceed 2.5 percent of the aggregate assessed value of all such real property. The taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board shall be equitably apportioned among the properties subject to such taxes, fees, and assessments according to the need for governmental services and facilities created by the degree of density of development of each such property. The proceeds of taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board shall be used only for the purpose of providing governmental services and facilities which are specially required by the degree of density of development within the district and not for the purpose of providing those governmental services and facilities provided to the county as a whole. Any tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall be collected by Dawson County in the same manner as taxes, fees, and assessments are levied by Dawson County. Delinquent taxes shall bear the same interest and penalties as Dawson County ad valorem taxes and may be enforced and collected in the same manner.

                  (b)  The board shall levy the taxes, fees, and assessments in subsection (a) of this section subsequent to the report of the assessed taxable values for the current calendar year and notify Dawson County in writing so that the district levy may be included on Dawson County's regular ad valorem tax bills. 
                  (c)  If, but for this provision, a parcel of real property is removed from a district or otherwise would become nontaxable, it shall continue to bear its tax millage then extant upon such event for bonded indebtedness of the district then outstanding until said bonded indebtedness then outstanding is paid or refunded. 
                  (d)  Each property owner paying taxes, fees, or assessments levied by the board for any public facility as set forth in Section 2 of this Act may receive a credit equal to the present value of all such taxes, fees, and assessments toward any impact fee as may be levied by Dawson County against such property for system improvements which are in the same category as said public facility in accordance with Chapter 71 of Title 36 of the O.C.G.A. [O.C.G.A. § 36-71-1 et seq.], the "Georgia Development Impact Fee Act." Application for such development impact fee credit may be granted by legislative action of the governing authority of Dawson County in its discretion. 
                  Sec. 7. - Boundaries of the districts. 
                  (a)  The boundaries of each district shall be as designated as such by the governing authority of Dawson County as set forth in the resolutions required in Section 4 of this Act, or as may thereafter be added as provided in this Act.

                  (3)  The adoption of a resolution consenting to the annexation by the board of the district; and 
                  (4)  The adoption of a resolution consenting to the annexation by the governing authority of Dawson County. 
                  Sec. 8. - Debt. 
                  Except as otherwise provided in this section, each district may incur debt without regard to the requirements of Article IX, Section V of the Constitution of Georgia, or any other provision of law prohibiting or restricting the borrowing of money or the creation of debt by political subdivisions of the State of Georgia, which debt shall be backed by the full faith and credit and taxing power of the district but shall not be an obligation of the State of Georgia or any other unit of government of the State of Georgia other than the district. 
                  Sec. 9. - Cooperation with local governments. 
                  The services and facilities provided pursuant to this Act shall be provided for in a cooperation agreement executed jointly by the board and by Dawson County.

Said control shall include, but not be limited to, the modification of, access to, and degree and type of services provided through or by facilities of the county.

                  (a)  Notes or other obligations issued by a district other than general obligation bonds shall be paid solely from the property pledged to pay such notes or other obligations.

                  (d)  The board shall have power from time to time and whenever it deems it expedient to refund any bonds by the issuance of new bonds, whether or not the bonds to be refunded have matured, and may issue bonds partly to refund bonds then outstanding and partly for any other purpose permitted by this Act.

                  (h)  In lieu of specifying the rate or rates of interest which such bonds are to bear and the principal amount and maturities of such bonds, the notice to the district attorney or the Attorney General, the notice to the public of the time, place, and date of the validation hearing, and the petition and complaint for validation may state that the bonds when issued will bear interest at a rate not exceeding a maximum per annum rate of interest which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time and that the principal amount will not exceed and the final maturity date will not be later than as specified in such notices and petition and complaint or may state that, in the event the bonds are to bear different rates of interest for different maturity dates, none of such rates will exceed the maximum rate which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time so specified; provided, however, that nothing in this subsection shall be construed as prohibiting or restricting the right of a board to sell such bonds at a discount, even if in doing so the effective interest cost resulting would exceed the maximum per annum interest rate specified in such notices and in the petition and complaint. 
                  (i)  The terms "cost of the project" and "cost of any project" shall have the meaning prescribed in this Act whenever those terms are referred to in bond resolutions of a board, in bonds, notes, or other obligations of the district, or in notices or proceedings to validate such bonds, notes, or other obligations of a district. 
                  Sec. 12. - Authorized contents of agreements and instruments; use of proceeds of sale bonds, notes, and other obligations; subsequent issues of obligations. 
                  (a)  Subject to the limitations and procedures provided by this section and by Section 11 of this Act, the agreements or instruments executed by a board may contain such provisions not inconsistent with law as shall be determined by the board.

                  (c)  Issuance by a board of one or more series of bonds, notes, or other obligations for one or more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds, notes, or other obligations in connection with the same project or with any other projects; but the proceeding wherein any subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations are issued shall recognize and protect any prior loan agreement, security agreement, or other agreement or instrument made for any prior issue of bonds, notes, or other obligations, unless in the resolution authorizing such prior issue the right is expressly reserved to the board to issue subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations on a parity with such prior issue. 
                  (d)  In the event that any district shall be terminated in accordance with this Act, the board shall serve until December 31 of the year in which termination shall be approved for the purpose of concluding any ongoing matters and projects, but, if such cannot be concluded by December 31, then the governing authority of the county shall assume the duties of the administrative board and shall be expressly authorized to exercise the authority of the administrative board. In the alternative, the governing authority of the county may, by resolution, assume all rights and obligations of the district, either bonds or otherwise, and the district shall cease to exist upon the adoption of such resolution.

                  This Act shall be liberally construed to effect the purposes hereof. The offer, sale, or issuance of bonds, notes, or other obligations by a district shall not be subject to regulation under Chapter 5 of Title 10 of the O.C.G.A. [O.C.G.A. § 10-5-1 et seq.], the "Georgia Securities Act of 1973." No notice, proceeding, or publication except those required hereby shall be necessary to the performance of any act authorized hereby, nor shall any such act be subject to referendum.

                  (b)  At the official caucus of electors at which board members are to be elected in the tenth year following creation of the district, and every tenth year thereafter, the question shall be put to the electors present to dissolve the community improvement district. Upon an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the electors present and voting, who shall represent at least 75 percent of the votes cast on the basis of value, the board shall send a ballot to each owner of property subject to taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board for a vote on the dissolution. Upon receipt of ballots consenting to the dissolution from a majority of the property owners, who shall represent at least 75 percent of the assessed value of said properties, the board shall request dissolution by the governing authority and shall forward said ballots to the Dawson County Tax Commissioner for certification. 
                  (c)  In the event that successful action is taken pursuant to this section to dissolve the district, the dissolution shall become effective at such time as all debt obligations of the district have been satisfied.

                  (d)  Upon a successful dissolution action, all noncash assets of the district other than public facilities or land or easements to be used for such public facilities, as described in Section 2 of this Act, shall be reduced to cash and, along with all other cash on hand, shall be applied to the repayment of any debt obligation of the district.

                  Sec. 2-107. - Authority. 
                  (a)  The Dawson County board of commissioners authorizes the county manager to exercise procurement responsibility subject to the limitations and terms included in this policy.

                  Sec. 2-108. - Ethics in public purchasing and contracting. 
                  (a)  It shall be unethical for any county employee involved in making procurement decisions to have personal investments in any business entity that creates a conflict between their private interests and their public duties. 
                  (b)  It shall be unethical for any person to offer, give, or agree to give any Dawson County employee, or for any Dawson County employee to solicit, demand, accept, or agree to accept from any vendor or business, a gift or gratuity in any amount in exchange for any decision, approval, disapproval, or recommendation concerning a solicitation.

Failure to comply with the provisions of this policy will result in disciplinary action.

Such individuals or firms shall be prohibited from making gifts or providing favors to any individual listed under the definition of financial interest, immediate family or conflict of interest who is charged with the duty of preparing plans, specifications or estimates for public contract, awarding or administering public contracts or inspecting or supervision of construction. 
                  (d)  It shall be a breach of ethical standards for any county employee to participate directly or indirectly in procurement when the employee knows: 
                  (1)  The employee (or prospective employee that an offer of employment is anticipated or has been made) or any member of the employee's immediate family, board members, officer, agent, his or her partner, has a financial interest pertaining to the procurement; 
                  (2)  A business or organization in which the employee, or any member of the employee's immediate family, has a financial interest pertaining to the procurement; or 
                  (2)  Any other person, business or organization with whom the employee or any member of employee's immediate family is negotiating or has an arrangement concerning prospective employment is involved in the procurement. 
                  (e)  The employee may, at the same time, request from the purchasing manager an advisory opinion as to what further participation, if any, the employee may have in the procurement. It shall be at the sole discretion of the purchasing manager to determine if the employee may have any further participation in the procurement and, if so, the extent to which the employee may participate. Any employee who fails to comply with the provisions of this paragraph may be subject to disciplinary action. 
                  (f)  A county employee, who has reason to believe that he/she or his/her immediate family have an interest that may be affected by his/her official acts or actions as a county employee or by the official acts or actions of county shall disclose the precise nature and value of such interest in a written disclosure statement to the purchasing manager. The employee's disclosure statement will be reviewed by the purchasing manager and the purchasing manager will respond to the employee in writing with an opinion as to the propriety of said interest. 
                  (g)  In the event that the purchasing manager has reason to believe that he/she or his/her immediate family has an interest that may be affected by his/her official acts or actions as a county employee or by the official acts or actions of county, he/she shall disclose the precise nature and value of such interest in a written disclosure statement to the purchasing manager. 
                  (h)  Solicitation or acceptance of gifts from bidders, offerors, contractors or subcontractors is prohibited. No official or employee shall have a personal interest in a transaction or contract. No county employee or county official shall be paid by the county for products or services outside the realm of their job duties. The purchasing manager at the direction of the CFO shall provide information regarding these prohibitions to employees and affected volunteers. 
                  (i)  No county official or employee shall accept vendor paid trips to vendor sites or other locations if the trip or any expenses associated with the trip are paid by anyone other than the employee or county without prior written approval of the county manager. 
                  (j)  Exception. The county understands that site visits may be vital to a successful contract. All information must be included in bid pricing and approved by the board of commissioners at time of award.

                  Sec. 2-110. - Approval limits. 
                  Chart 1—Signing Authority 

                   
                  (a)  A PO (contract) and e-Verify form is mandatory for all services/labor of $2,500.00 or more per O.C.G.A. § 13-10-91. 
                  (b)  Proof of insurance for all vendors is required for all services performed on site to the county. All companies must have the proper insurance as required by law. 
                  (c)  Each department is responsible for obtaining the e-verify form and proper insurance certificates for services being performed on site. The e-verify form and proof of insurance form is to be forwarded to the purchasing department with each quote analysis form, when appropriate. 
                  (1)  Less than $2,999.99. Departments are not required to obtain three quotes but are strongly encouraged to do so to ensure the best cost and quality for the county. Department head approval is required for purchases under threshold. 
                  (2)  Between $3,000.00 and $24,999.99. 
                  a.  Informal written quotes from at least three sources must be obtained. Faxed, emailed or website quotations are acceptable. Purchases must be supported by written quotations from vendors. Direct solicitation is allowed. Award of purchase requires the approval of the department head and purchasing manager. 
                  b.  Verbal quotes are not accepted. Departments should avoid requesting quotes from vendors who have previously been non-responsive. If departments continue to return non-responsive quotes, purchasing will be unable to issue a purchase order until three valid, good-faith quotes are obtained. It is understood that some vendors will be non-responsive and departments should try to obtain as many quotes as possible. 
                  c.  If a vendor is a sole source, meaning they are the only vendor who can provide the required goods and/or services, departments should give a detailed explanation and attach to the quote analysis form. Examples of sole source justification are: continuation of previous services, maintenance agreement with vendor who provides software, or regional vendors of direct manufactures. 
                  (3)  Over $25,000. The formal sealed bid must be used and a solicitation must be publicly advertised in the legal organ at least 14 days prior to the date set for opening.

Approval to release a formal solicitation must be approved by the county manager. Some exceptions apply and are listed under the "exceptions" section within this document. 
                  (Ord. of 1-17-2019) 
                  Sec. 2-111. - Solicitations. 
                  The decision to release quotes, either formal or informal, or sealed solicitations is based on several factors that include but are not limited to: anticipated cost, department expectations, liability to the county and other factors to provide the best overall value for the county. These processes are used to obtain competitive pricing. A cost analysis of the purchase must be completed and kept in the project file when procuring with federal and state funds. 
                  Chart 2—Purchasing Method 

                   
                  (1)  Preparing specifications. It is the responsibility of the department to determine and write bid specifications. The purchasing department may assist in developing specifications. If the purchasing department is involved in developing specifications, the needs of the end user should be the primary focus. After written specifications are complete, the purchasing department will insert into the solicitation document. It is the responsibility of the purchasing department to determine the method of purchase, to ensure that specifications are not so restrictive that only one bid can be obtained and that adequate competition is available. The delivery location must be specified in the original request. 
                  (2)  Brand name specifications. When references are made in solicitation documents to trade names or the brand names of manufacturers, such references are made solely to designate and identify the quality of materials or equipment to be furnished and are not intended to restrict competitive bidding. If comparable materials or equipment with different trade names are offered, then the bidder must establish equivalency. Product literature or catalogs may be submitted to support claim of equality. Several vendors may be able to provide the same manufacturer therefore competition is available. If a department has been approved to standardize equipment, a brand name may be requested with no exceptions unless the source of funds is provided by federal and/or state grants. 
                  (3)  Standardization. Standardization is a method to achieve savings by purchasing a limited number of brands or products. Departments such as fleet or public safety may use this option more frequently than others as a means to guarantee compatibility or proper maintenance and training. The use of the standardization clause is neither automatic nor frequent. The department must submit, in writing, why the standardization clause (brand names) should be used for each occurrence. This documentation will be provided with the formal request and kept for audit purposes. The county manager and or purchasing department have discretion when to use standardization. 
                  (4)  Sole source. Sole source procurements should be infrequently used in purchasing. There are times when a sole source is needed aside from standardization: non-competing districts of a company where Georgia is its own market, proprietary information, software and equipment, continuation of services, or the like. It is the responsibility of the requesting department to articulate the reasoning behind the sole source request. The purchasing department and/or county manager may approve sole source procurement when a clear and compelling reason justifies the sole source. 
                  (5)  Professional services are infrequent and sometimes unique and may not be able to be formally solicited. Formal bids are not required but the governing authority must approve the contract and award if over the threshold. It is the responsibility of the department to articulate why a bid is not in the best interest of the county. In the event professional services are needed but a bid is not requested, the discretion lies with the purchasing manager and county manager. 
                  The department director is responsible for acquiring a detailed scope of services and price which shall not be amended without prior written approval from the dollar amount threshold approving authority. Proof of insurance and a completed e-verify form must be submitted with the detailed scope of services. 
                  The purchasing manager is to submit a professional services exemption letter to the county manager if costs are budgeted and to the board of commissioners if costs are not budgeted or over $0.01 over budget. A purchase order shall be issued after approval has been granted. 
                  (6)  Less than $25,000.00. 
                  a.  Quotations. 
                  1.  Quotations are an informal process when compared to sealed solicitations. The type of quotation used depends on cost, department expectations, risk to the county and approval limits. Sealed responses are not required and quotes are not typically solicited via the legal organ. Purchasing, at their option, may release a formal request for quote using the county's website or other media outlets but is not required to do so. 
                  2.  With regards to purchase orders, quote pricing is good for 90 days. Departments may continue to order off the approved quotation for this period of time. Upon the 91 st day, departments will need at least three new quotations and request a new purchase order per policy. 
                  3.  Purchase orders shall be issued prior to the purchase of goods and/or services over the individual signing authority of the department head and elected officials. 
                  (7)  Request for quotation by departments (internal quote) $1.00 to $2,999.99. An informal process for the quick purchase of low dollar items from $1.00 to $2,999.99 require written, verbal, phone, website or e-mail confirmation. $2,999.99 is the standard approval limits for most departments. This policy typically takes one to three days and is designed for immediate purchases and requires department head approval. If purchasing commodities/services with Federal Transit Administration (FTA) funds, the department must obtain written permission from the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) representative of FTA funds prior to procurement. Micro-purchases should be distributed equitably among qualified suppliers. See (12) below. 
                  Micro purchases do not fall under the FTA's Buy America requirements. Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements, however, will apply to construction contracts exceeding $2,000, even though the recipient uses micro-purchase procurement procedures. 
                  (8)  Request for quotation by departments (internal quote) $3,000.00 to $9,999.99. For this price point, a more formal process than internal quotes but less formal than other options shall be followed. This process is used for purchases of items from $3,000.00 to $9,999.99 and requires written quotes from vendor or from a website. This process typically takes one to three days and is designed for immediate purchases and requires department head and purchasing manager approval. 
                  (9)  Request for quotation (RFQ) $10,000 to $24,999.99. Process may be either formal or informal process, but a short form is sent to vendors. Used for the purchase of dollar amounts between $10,000.00 to $24,999.99 well-defined goods or services. This policy typically takes one to two weeks. For purchases between $3,000.00 and $24,999.99 policy requires the department head, purchasing manager approval. 
                  (10)  Request for quotations (RFQ)—Formal request. Formal request for quotations may be sent out via the purchasing department when necessary to add stipulations and/or contracts for goods or services under the bid threshold. Formal RFQs require the requesting department, alongside purchasing, to complete the solicitation request form. This process typically takes up to two to three weeks to solicit, approve, award, and execute contracts. 
                  (11)  Cooperative agreements. The use of state or other verified contracts may be used when approved by the county manager or board of commissioners based on amount to be spent. A cooperative agreement must be in place in order to participate or "piggy-back" off of another contract solicited by another agency. 
                  a.  The department of administrative services for the State of Georgia competitively bids certain commodities, supplies, and services on an annual basis. Copies of these contracts and revisions are maintained on-line at www.doas.state.ga.us. For federal contracts visit www.gsa.gov for a listing in the event of a federally declared disaster, technology as well as public safety equipment. 
                  b.  The state contract price may be used to establish the maximum price for a good or service. 
                  c.  These contracts are available to Dawson County for use but are not mandatory. Competitive bidding by Dawson County will not be required if these contracts are utilized. When cooperative agreements are used for source justification, there will be no requirement for board of commissioner approval, unless the dollar amount is meets the threshold for board approval. See Chart 1. If the threshold meets the need for board approval, a procurement approval request letter shall be addressed to the board chairman. The letter shall contain justification for use of the cooperative agreement, the item/services to procure and the dollar amount of purchase. 
                  d.  If purchased off a cooperative agreement, and budget is already approved for the specific expenditure, the board of commissioners' approval is not required if under the bid threshold. A procurement approval request letter shall be addressed to the county manager. The letter shall contain justification for use of the cooperative agreement, the item/services to procure and the dollar amount of purchase. 
                  (12)  Procurement with federal or grant funds. When purchasing with federal or grant funds; other regulations may supersede local purchasing policies as follows. When purchasing with (FTA) funds it is specifically necessary to ensure full and open competition and equitable treatment of all potential sources of all purchases consistent with FTA Circular 4220.1F "Third Party Contracting Guidance" or latest version thereof; Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, 2 CFR Part 200 (referred to now as the "Super Circular" and which replaced and consolidated OMB Circulars A-87, A-102, A-110, A-122, and A-133) ; Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, 2 CFR part 1201, which replaces 49 CFR parts 18 and 19; GDOT Section 5311 State Management Plan; and GDOT Section 5311 Program Manual. The following should be followed for all federal awards as sub-recipients. 
                  a.  The current procurement standards detailed in 200.318, General Procurement Standards. 
                  1.  When conforms to applicable federal law and standards, the Dawson County Purchasing Policy Ordinance is to be followed. 
                  2.  If a conflict exists between a member of the evaluation team and any proposer, written notification is to be forwarded to the purchasing department to preclude that member from the process. The requesting department director will appoint a new evaluation team member. As with non-federal or grant funds, each evaluation team member must attest on the provided form that no personal interest or conflict exists. 
                  3.  If a conflict exists between any Dawson County board of commissioners and the recommended offeror, that member must notify the purchasing department of the conflict and recuse themselves from the vote recommending award of the contract or purchase order. 
                  4.  Records must contain the detail of the history of the procurement for each project to include, rationale for the method of procurement, selection of contract type, contractor selection or rejection and the basis for the contract price (cost analysis). Equipment and real property purchased in the amount of $5,000.00 per item/property must be used in the program for which it is purchased, adequately maintained, safeguarded under an appropriate control system and physically inventoried at least once every two years. 
                  5.  Paid contractors who drafted or developed the specifications, requirements, statements of work or invitations for bids or requests for proposals must be excluded. 
                  b.  The current procurement standards detailed in 200.320, Methods of Procurement. 
                  1.  Procurement by micro-purchases. 
                  i.  Competitive quotations are not required on amounts of $3,500.00 or below but, county employees must follow the Dawson County Purchasing Policy Ordinance for these purchases. If purchasing commodities/services with FTA funds, the department must obtain written permission from the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) representative of FTA funds prior to procurement. Micro-purchases should be distributed equitably among qualified suppliers. 
                  Micro purchases do not fall under the FTA's Buy America requirements. Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements, however, will apply to construction contracts exceeding $2,000.00, even though the recipient uses micro-purchase procurement procedures. 
                  Every micro-purchase must be accompanied by a written determination that the price is fair and reasonable and a description of how that determination was made when utilizing FTA funds. 
                  2.  Procurement by small purchases procedures. 
                  i.  Two or more quotations must be sent to qualified sources between $3,500.00 and $150,000.00 but, county employees must follow the Dawson County Purchasing Policy Ordinance for these purchases. If purchasing commodities/services with FTA funds, the department must obtain written permission from the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) representative of FTA funds and the board of commissioners prior to procurement. 
                  3.  Procurement by sealed bids. 
                  i.  Preferred method for construction and commodities. The responsive and responsible lowest bid is to be awarded contract. 
                  4.  Procurement by competitive proposals. 
                  i.  Preferred method for services. Weight is to be set and published within the document for technical evaluations and for price. 
                  5.  Procurement by non-competitive bids/proposals. 
                  i.  This method is to be used when the commodity and/or service can be provided from one company/individual. A letter from the company/individual must be received and placed in the file. Verification of the sole source must be recorded in the file. 
                  c.  The current procurement standards as detailed in 200.317-200.326 Suspension and Debarment and 2 CRF Parts 180 and 1200 Non-procurement Suspension and Debarment or under the FAR at 48 CRF Chapter 1, Part 9.4. 
                  1.  Suspension and debarment. 
                  i.  Dawson County shall not enter into any transactions with parties who are suspended or debarred from doing business with the State of Georgia or federal agencies. 
                  ii.  Verification of the status of a contractor completed by the purchasing manager or the grant administrator must be maintained in the file. 
                  (a)  State of Georgia suspended or debarred vendors can be verified at http://doas.ga.gov/state-purchasing/law-administrative-rules-and-policies/state- suspended-and-debarred-suppliers 
                  (b)  Federal suspended or debarred vendors can be verified at www.sam.gov 
                  d.  The current procurement standards as detailed in 49 U.S.C. Section 5325(j)(2)(A) Integrity and Ethics. 
                  1.  The potential contractor must have a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics and found to be compliant in the regulation listed above. 
                  e.  The following must be followed with sealed solicitations specifically when utilizing FTA funds: 
                  1.  Affirmative Action and DBE. Is in compliance with the Super Circular' affirmative action and FTA's Disadvantaged Business Enterprise requirements. 
                  2.  Public Policy. Is in compliance with the public policies of the federal government, as required by 49 U.S.C. § Section 5325(j)(2)(B). 
                  3.  Administrative and technical capacity. Has the necessary organization, experience, accounting, and operational controls, and technical skills, or the ability to obtain them, in compliance with 49 U.S.C. Section 5325(j)(2)(D). 
                  4.  Licensing and taxes. Is in compliance with applicable licensing and tax laws and regulations. 
                  5.  Financial resources. Has, or can obtain, sufficient financial resources to perform the contract, as required by 49 U.S.C. Section 5325(j)(2)(D). 
                  6.  Production capability. Has, or can obtain, the necessary production, construction, and technical equipment and facilities. 
                  7.  Timeliness. Is able to comply with the required delivery or performance schedule, taking into consideration all existing commercial and governmental business commitments. 
                  8.  Performance record. Is able to provide a: 
                  i.  Current performance. Satisfactory current performance record; and 
                  ii.  Past performance. Satisfactory past performance record in view of its records of long-time performance or performance with a predecessor entity, including: 
                  (a)  Sufficient resources. Key personnel with adequate experience, a parent firm with adequate resources and experience, and key subcontractors with adequate experience and past performance, 
                  (b)  Adequate past experience. Past experience in carrying out similar work with particular attention to management approach, staffing, timeliness, technical success, budgetary controls, and other specialized considerations as described in the recipient's solicitation, and 
                  (c)  Any past deficiencies not the fault of the bidder or offeror. A prospective bidder or offeror that is or recently has been seriously deficient in contract performance is presumed to be non-responsible, unless the recipient determines that the circumstances were properly beyond the bidder or offeror's control, or unless the bidder or offeror has taken appropriate corrective action. Past failure to apply sufficient tenacity, perseverance, and effort to perform acceptably is strong evidence of non-responsibility. Failure to meet the quality requirements of a contract is a significant factor to consider in determining satisfactory performance. GDOT expects Dawson County to consider the number of the bidder or offeror's contracts involved and the extent of deficient performance in each contract when making this determination. 
                  f.  Independent cost estimate. A written independent cost estimate, for every procurement with FTA funds, prior to receiving price quotes, bids or proposals needs to be created. 
                  g.  Cost or price analysis. The department head receiving the grant shall work with the purchasing manager to perform a cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement action above the federal small acquisition threshold, including contract modifications. 
                  1.  Price analysis. If the county determines that competition was adequate, a written price analysis, rather than a cost analysis, is required to determine the reasonableness of the proposed contract price. 
                  2.  Cost analysis. The county must perform or obtain a cost analysis when: 
                  i.  A price analysis will not provide sufficient information to determine the reasonableness of the contract cost. 
                  ii.  When the offeror submits elements of the estimated cost. 
                  iii.  When only a sole source is available, even if the procurement is a contract modification. 
                  iv.  In the event of a change order. 
                  (13)  $25,000.00 and above, sealed solicitations. 
                  a.  The release of sealed solicitations is a formal process to solicit responses from qualified vendors. Federal, state and local laws may and usually will apply based on project. There are three types of sealed solicitations: Invitation for bid (IFB), request for proposals (RFP) and request for qualifications (RFQ). 
                  b.  Departments should assist purchasing with the background information and defining the scope of work or deliverables for the solicitation. It is the responsibility of the department director(s) to provide the budgeting code and ensure funds are loaded for the project. If the project is not pre-funded, purchasing shall receive the account information the department director intends to utilize prior to release of the sealed bid. 
                  The goal of procurement practices is to provide an atmosphere in which all procurement transactions will be conducted in a manner providing full and open competition. The county will avoid the following situations considered to be restrictive of competition: 
                  1.  Unreasonable requirements placed on firms in order for them to qualify to do business; 
                  2.  Unnecessary experience and excessive bonding requirements; 
                  3.  Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between affiliated companies; 
                  4.  Noncompetitive awards to any person or firm on retainer contracts; 
                  5.  Organizational conflicts of interest, which means that because of other activities, relationships, or contracts, a contractor is unable, or potentially unable, to render impartial assistance or advice to the grantee; a contractor's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired; or a contractor has an unfair competitive advantage; 
                  6.  The specification of only a "brand name" product without listing its salient characteristics and not allowing "an equal" product to be offered; and 
                  7.  Any arbitrary action in the procurement process. 
                  c.  If the solicitation is of a complex nature, a pre-proposal meeting should be scheduled and detailed in the solicitation document. The meeting can be optional or mandatory. 
                  1.  Invitation for bid (IFB). A sealed IFB is sent to prospective bidders when goods or services desired are well-defined and represent a high dollar purchase of $25,000.00 or more. This policy typically takes six to eight weeks. 
                  2.  Request for proposal (RFP). A formal, sealed RFP is sent to prospective bidders when the goods or services desired are high dollar $25,000.00 or more, complex, and not wholly defined. Same pre-solicitation process as noted for an invitation for bid (IFB) but the focus on the solicitation grading differs. Whereas price is the driving factor with IFBs, a criterion is defined in the RFP and an evaluation committee must score each submittal. This policy typically takes six to eight weeks. 
                  3.  Request for qualifications (RFQ). A formal, sealed RFQ is sent to prospective bidders when the goods or services desired are high dollar $25,000.00 or more, complex, and not wholly defined and where the focus of the project is the qualifications of the vendor not the price. A similar scoring criterion shall be defined in the RFQ. 
                  For some projects where federal laws superseded local policies, price may or may not be an allowable scoring criterion, and therefore may not be requested within the proposal. In this case, the vendor is determined based on the scoring criterion and price is then negotiated with the highest scoring vendor. If a price cannot be agreed upon, the county will move on to the next highest scoring vendor. There are some federal laws that state that price may be used to score but should not be the driving factor. 
                  Both the department and purchasing to take note if federal or state laws provide guidance to bid process such as the Brooks Act or Davis/Bacon Wage Act. 
                  If no other law or policy relates to the RFQ and the team wants to consider pricing but only after scoring, it may be in the best interest of the county to request pricing be sealed separately within RFQ submittal. Vendors should be ranked based on qualifications and only the short listed vendors pricing should be opened. 
                  Because of the complex nature of this type of solicitation, this policy typically takes eight to ten weeks. 
                  Pre-qualification. Prospective vendors may be pre-qualified for particular types of goods or services, typically technical and construction services through the solicitation process, specifically a request for qualifications. The solicitation document should clearly read the intent of the document is to pre-qualify vendors. All procurement rules apply to this form of solicitation such as advertisement notices and award. 
                  Upon establishment of a pre-qualified vendors list, requests for proposals or requests for quotations may be submitted to individuals or companies on the list. 
                  d.  Solicitation provision for federal and state funded projects, specifically FTA funded projects. 
                  "Dawson County has moved to adopt the policies contained in the Georgia Procurement Manual Code of Ethics, (I.4.4. These policies shall apply to Dawson County employees involved in procurement. It is a breach of ethical standards for any Dawson County employee to participate directly or indirectly in a procurement when the employee knows:

                  • A business or organization in which the employee, or any member of the employee's immediate family, has a financial interest pertaining to the procurement; or 
                  • Any other person, business or organization with whom the employee or any member of employee's immediate family is negotiating or has an arrangement concerning prospective employment is involved in the procurement. 
                  In addition, any persons acting as members of an evaluation committee for any procurement shall, for the purposes of the procurement, be bound by conditions of this section. Throughout the bid/proposal evaluation process and subsequent contract negotiations, offerors shall not discuss or seek specific information about this procurement, including but not limited to, the contents of submissions, the evaluation process or the contract negotiations, with members of any evaluation committee, Dawson County employees or other governing board members other than the designated procurement officer." 
                  e.  Confidential information. A County employee may not directly or indirectly make use of, or permit others to make use of, for the purpose of furthering a private interest, confidential information acquired by virtue of their position or employment with county. 
                  f.  Buy America Requirements for FTA construction contracts and acquisition for goods or rolling stock solicitations valued at $150,000.00 or greater must notify bidders of the Buy America regulation as stated in 49 U.S.C. 5323(j) and 49 CFR 661.13 which stipulate that federal funds may not be obligated unless steel, iron and manufactured products used in FTA-funded projects are produced in the United States, unless a waiver has been granted by TFA or the product is subject to general waiver as listed in 49 CFR 661.7. Rolling stock must be assembled in the United States and have a 60 percent domestic content. 
                  A bidder or offeror must submit to the FTA recipient the appropriate Buy America certification with all bids or offers on FTA-funded contracts, except those subject to general waiver. Bid or offers that are not accompanied by a completed Buy America certification must be rejected as nonresponsive. This requirement does not apply to lower tier subcontractors. 
                  (Ord. of 1-17-2019) 
                  Sec. 2-112. - Formal solicitation process.

                  (5)  Government building. All public works solicitation notices shall be posted conspicuously in the government building as per O.C.G.A. § 36-91-20(b)(1). For conformity, all other solicitations shall be posted in the same manner. 
                  (b)  Bonds. Bonds add another layer of protection to the county. If the procurement of goods/services opens the county up to additional liability, bonds should be required. Bonds should always be required in public works construction projects and Georgia Department of Transportation funded projects. The decision to require bonds in a formal solicitation, are at the discretion of the purchasing Manager and the county manager if not required by federal or state law. 
                  (1)  If required under the scope of work of the solicitation document, any combination of the following bonds may be requested by Dawson County. 
                  a.  A five percent bid bond. 
                  b.  A 100 percent payment bond*. 
                  c.  A 100 percent performance bond*. 
                  Note: Higher or lower bonds may be stipulated as required by funding source: GDOT or federal funds. If any change is needed, specifications will be outlined in the solicitation document. 
                  (2)  The bid and payment bonds can take the following forms: cash, cashier's check or certified check. An irrevocable letter of credit by a bank or a savings and loan association, as defined in O.C.G.A. § 7-1-14 may be accepted by the county for the bid and performance bonds when the amount of any bond does not exceed $750,000.00, at the sole discretion of Dawson County.

                  (3)  Bonds are suggested when using SPLOST funds, project estimates are over $100,000.00, or when special circumstances dictate additional protection is prudent. Bonds are required when public works construction and road projects laws are in effect. 
                  (4)  All bonds would be payable to Dawson County board of commissioners. Failure to submit appropriate bonding will result in automatic rejection of bid. Bonding company must be authorized to do business in Georgia by the Georgia Insurance Commission, listed in the Department of Treasury's publication of companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable surety on federal bonds and as acceptable reinsuring companies, and have an A.M. Best rating. 
                  (5)  The cost of bonds may be included in the vendor's price proposal but should not be line item priced. The county will not pay for bonds and are considered cost of doing business. 
                  (6)  Bonds will be released at the discretion of the project manager who ensures the vendor has fulfilled the scope of work, the purchasing manager to ensure all contractual obligations have been satisfied and the final approval is of the county manager. Usually, this is 30 days after successful completion and acceptance of the project. 
                  (c)  Retainage. When a project is of import but not to the level of requiring bonds, the purchasing manager may add language to the solicitation document and contracts regarding retainage. The vendor shall be paid for work performed based upon satisfactory inspections and completion of the agreed upon draw schedule. The vendor's fee will be paid on a Net 30 basis less ten percent retainage. 
                  (1)  Retainage will be released at the discretion of the project manager who ensures the vendor has fulfilled the scope of work, the purchasing manager to ensure all contractual obligations have been satisfied and the final approval is of the county manager. Usually, this is 30 days after successful completion and acceptance of the project. 
                  (d)  Pre-bid and pre-proposal conferences. The nature of some solicitations require that a pre-bid or pre-proposal conference be held in order to clarify specifications, answer bidder questions regarding specific requirements, or to allow bidders to perform a site visit, review and/or inspection. 
                  (1)  The purchasing department and requesting department will confer whether to hold a pre- bid/proposal conference. Conferences are not the standard. If the project is over $100,000.00 or bonds are in effect, a meeting is required and mandatory. Information regarding conferences will be included in all legal notice(s). If it is later determined a meeting is necessary, an addenda must be issued and bidders must have enough notice to make arrangements to attend. 
                  (2)  All attendees are to sign in on the sheet provided by purchasing. In the event a meeting is mandatory, bidders not signed in may not submit a response. The sign in will be posted on the county's website. 
                  (e)  Addenda. Any changes to the original solicitation will be made in writing in the form of an addendum, and will be placed on the County's website. All addenda shall be issued prior to 72 hours of the bid opening date for public works, roads and bridges projects and when expending federal and state funds. If such an addendum is deemed necessary after this period, the bid opening date must be extended 72 hours form the original set date, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays. It is the responsibility of the bidder to obtain any and all addenda and submit with their response. 
                  In addition, if bidders have any additional questions or information requests regarding a specific procurement, they are to be emailed or faxed directly to purchasing as directed in the solicitation document. Responses to pertinent questions will be answered in the form of addenda. 
                  (f)  Bid opening. All bids shall be opened at a time and place designated in the solicitation request. The purchasing manager and/or CFO and one other staff member, not from the requesting department, acting as a witness shall open all sealed bids. Late bids will not be accepted. Late bids will be rejected and returned. This cannot be waived by any entity. Sealed responses are required. Vendors who fail to return sealed responses will be rejected and returned. If at least three bids are not received the board of commissioners may reject, requiring a re-bid. Witnesses should not be from the department requesting the bids. 
                  (1)  In the case of invitation for bids, the names and prices shall be read aloud. Dawson County does not report an "apparent low bid." For request for proposals or qualifications, only the names shall be read aloud due to the need for future evaluation and review of the proposals. 
                  (2)  Bids/proposals are not subject to the Georgia Open Records Act until such time that as the final award of the contract is made, the project is terminated or abandoned, or the board takes a vote regarding the solicitation, whichever comes first as per O.C.G.A. § 50-18-72(a)(10). Some materials may be redacted per the Georgia Open Records Act and the records custodian and/or the county attorney can assist in determining what, if any information may be redacted. 
                  (g)  Modifications/corrections of bids. If an error is discovered prior to the submittal deadline, the bidder may submit the corrected information in a sealed envelope clearly marked on the outside of the container. The outside must contain the company name, the bid number and the following sentence: "Replace previously sent response". The first submission cannot be considered valid. 
                  If an obvious clerical error is discovered after the bid opening, the bidder may submit a letter to purchasing requesting that the error be corrected. This request needs to be made within 24 hours of error being found. Final determination as to whether to accept the correction is up to purchasing. Generally, modifications made to open bids are not accepted for any reason other than the aforementioned. The error is subject to the limitations described below and may be corrected upon written request and verification submitted by the vendor. A nonmaterial omission in a bid may be corrected if the purchasing manager determines the correction to be in the county's best interests. Omissions affecting or relating to any of the following shall be deemed material and shall not be corrected after bid opening: 
                  (1)  Unit price information; and 
                  (2)  Total price information when unit prices are not required. 
                  (h)  Withdrawal of bids. A bid submission may be withdrawn without forfeiture of the bid security as per O.C.G.A. § 13-10-22, if applicable, if such error in the calculation can be documented by clear and convincing written evidence; such error can be shown from inspection of original work papers, etc. of the bidder; the bid was submitted in good faith and mistake was due to a calculation or clerical error, an inadvertent omission or a typographical error as opposed to an error in judgement. This request must be made within 48 hours, not including Saturday, Sunday and legal holidays, of bid opening and prior to award. 
                  If a bid withdrawal occurs, the remaining bids are to be treated as if the withdrawn bid was not submitted. No bidder permitted to withdraw a bid shall perform any subcontract or other work for the person or firm to whom the contract is awarded or otherwise benefit directly or indirectly for affiliated project. 
                  (i)  Evaluating submittals. 
                  (1)  An evaluation committee will be named during the pre-solicitation meetings between the requesting department and purchasing. This group shall consist of county personnel who have knowledge of the goods/services to be procured, will be affected by the solicitation or have other applicable knowledge. The committee shall score and rank proposals based on information solely provided within the vendor's submittal against the rubric in the solicitation document. Scoring criteria will be set by the purchasing department and the requesting department. It is the responsibility of each evaluator to: 
                  a.  Read the solicitation document in its entirety. 
                  b.  Read each submittal in its entirety. 
                  c.  Confirm responsiveness to the request: Ensure vendor has provided all information required in the RFP. Use the scoring criteria, scope of work and the vendor's checklist for assistance. 
                  d.  Check references thoroughly. Evaluators are encouraged to work together or share information received during this step only, i.e. email references or other correspondence from references. Never discuss scores with other evaluators until advised by purchasing to do so. Points should never be given if references are not vetted. All other sections of the evaluation are to be completed by each evaluator individually. 
                  e.  Evaluators should score using their own knowledge. 
                  f.  Contact purchasing with any questions that need clarification or additional information. Direct contact with vendors, each other or any other individual while in the solicitation process is strictly forbidden. 
                  g.  Complete the evaluation score sheet and return to purchasing along with original submittal packets. 
                  h.  Attend meetings when scheduled of the evaluation committee to include, meetings, interviews, demonstrations, etc. 
                  (2)  Evaluators should take care to evaluate based on information only provided in the bidder's response. Vendors should not receive credit for work not reflected in the bid. Failure to return all required information should be reflected in scoring. 
                  (3)  Proposer interview/presentation meeting. 
                  a.  After the evaluation committee has completed its process and the purchasing manager has received all evaluation forms, the consensus of the committee may be to hold proposer interviews/presentations. The proposers must be invited in order of ranking. Example: The first and third ranked submissions cannot be invited to this meeting but, exclude the second ranked submission. 
                  b.  Purchasing's responsibility is to invite bidders, create agenda, lead discussions, take minutes, and facilitate entire process. The requesting department should assist in formulating questions prior to the formal meeting. The evaluation committee is to prepare new evaluation forms and submit to the purchasing department. This score will supersede the previous score for those proposers that participated in this phase of the evaluation. 
                  (j)  Required forms. Dawson County may require vendors to submit documentation other than pricing to prove they are responsible and or responsive. A list of the required documentation should be required in the solicitation document and/or addenda. As a general rule, the following should be required in a vendor's response:

                  (11)  Contactor's affidavit. 
                  (12)  Subcontractor's affidavit (if applicable).

                  (k)  Technical waivers. Dawson County government reserves the right to reject any and all submittals and reserves the right to waive any non-material irregularities or informalities in any submittal or in the submittal policy, when to do so would be to the advantage of Dawson County. Dawson County reserves the right to cancel solicitations at any time. 
                  Dawson County shall be the sole judge of the provider's ability to meet the requirements set forth. Their decision in determining responsible and responsive provider(s) will be final. Dawson County reserves the right to act in its best interest in this determinations process, to waive all technicalities, and to select the most responsible and responsive treatment provider. 
                  (l)  Disqualification of bids. 
                  (1)  Bids may be disqualified or deemed non-responsive by purchasing as a result of, but not necessarily limited to, the following reasons: 
                  a.  Failure to return all required documents with signature where applicable. 
                  b.  Failure to follow the bid schedule to include excluding mandatory pre-bid attendance submittal deadline.

                  h.  Prices of services or items exceed the departments budgeted amount allowed for these items. 
                  (2)  Bids shall be disqualified or deemed non-responsive by purchasing as a result of, but not necessarily limited to, the following reasons: 
                  a.  Failure to follow solicitation schedule for mandatory pre-bid attendance and response submittal. 
                  b.  Failure to provide bid bond, where required. 
                  c.  Failure to hold firm pricing. 
                  d.  Failure to sign and submit the vendor's price proposal form. The bidder/proposer may submit other pages to complete their price proposal along with this form. 
                  (m)  Vendor responsibility. It is the responsibility of each vendor to read and understand all requirements in the solicitation documents. If an item is unclear, the vendor should submit questions to the purchasing department. Vendors shall submit all required documentation, fully executed, as directed in the solicitation document. Additionally, vendors should be familiar with all federal, state and local rules, regulations, policies and procedures pertaining to each solicitation. Furthermore, vendors performing work in Dawson County are required to register with the Dawson County planning and development department. Out of County bidders are not required to register as part of a bid submittal. Only the successful, awarded vendor is required to register their business license. 
                  (n)  Negotiations. If the department has selected a vendor but pricing or deliverables need to be negotiated, an invitation will be sent via email to the vendor. Enough notice shall be given to ensure the vendor can make reasonable accommodations to participate. 
                  (1)  Generally there should be only three rounds of negotiations with the selected vendor. 
                  (2)  If a price is not agreed upon, the best and final offer phase should be opened to all proposers deemed responsive and responsible. 
                  (o)  Best and final offers. Best and final offers, or BAFO, are formal requests being made for more information, confirmation, revisions, and/or to obtain better pricing or value. BAFO are not mandatory and should be used rarely. This method allows bidders to amend their proposal. Value engineering is not considered a reasonable cause to enter into best and final offers. All bidders whose proposals are deemed reasonable susceptible for further consideration or award should be invited to BAFO discussions. Any rejected bidders are not invited. The purchasing department will email an invitation for best and final offer negotiations to the responsive, responsible bidder(s) deemed susceptible for award based on the criteria set forth in the solicitation document. 
                  (p)  Purchasing's responsibility is to invite bidders, create agenda, lead discussions, take minutes, and facilitate entire process. The requesting department should assist in formulating questions prior to the formal meeting. At no time should competing bids/proposals, technical or cost, be discussed with bidders. Do not discuss where bidders are in the standing. Teleconferences are allowed if the evaluation committee feels this method fosters open dialogue and all questions can be addressed. There are times in-person discussions will be requested. 
                  (q)  The county will identify which offerors shall participate in the negotiations in one of the following ways: 
                  (1)  Identify in the solicitation document the methodology that will be used to identify offerors to participate in negotiations. This may include, but is not necessarily limited to, a methodology that establishes a competitive range based on offerors" rankings following proposal evaluations. 
                  (2)  Identify in an addendum to the solicitation document the methodology that will be used to identify offerors to participate in negotiations. 
                  (3)  Negotiate with all responsive responsible offerors following bid/proposal evaluations. 
                  (r)  After the negotiations, participating offerors may be asked to submit supplemental proposals defining the revisions that are a result of negotiations. Any request for supplemental proposals will be directed in writing to all offerors participating in the negotiations, and will provide details concerning the format and due date for the supplemental proposals. The county may in its sole discretion terminate negotiations and/or the solicitation at any time. 
                  (s)  The offeror that ultimately wins a contract may not be the lowest cost offeror because the higher quality of the winning bidder's technical proposal may offset an increased cost or because no agreement could be reached as to contract terms and conditions. The final decision and all documentation is considered open records upon award. 
                  (t)  Award. 
                  (1)  Timeline. The appropriate body or office must make the decision regarding a sealed solicitation within 60 days of the bid opening if bonds are in effect and 90 days of the bid opening if bonds are not required. In the unlikely event the county needs additional time to evaluate responses; the purchasing manager will contact each vendor and request additional time. If approval is garnered by each vendor then the solicitation award may be delayed to a time specific. If approval is not given by all vendors, purchasing will submit an agenda packet to the county manager asking for the rejection of the bid submittals and a re-bid shall be released. Only the board of commissioners can decide regarding sealed solicitations if the purchase is not budgeted, $0.01 over budget, if a highway, bridge, ferry or public works solicitation no matter the anticipated costs or if the lowest bidder or highest scored proposer is not recommended. Solicitations should never be allowed to expire without a formal decision. It is the responsibility of the purchasing manager to notify the chief financial officer and county manager of any issues or delays in the process ahead of time. 
                  The board of commissioners may choose to award highways, bridges, ferries or public works projects with a not-to-exceed amount to streamline change orders. 
                  (2)  Award to the lowest bidder. In the case of invitation for bids, for goods or services, if all proposals are not rejected the awarded shall be to the lowest, most responsive, responsible bidder unless legal justification can be articulated to the purchasing manager and the county manager. 
                  (3)  Award to the highest rated proposal. In the case of request for proposals or request for qualifications, for goods or services, if all proposals are not rejected, the award may be to the highest rated proposal, taking into account the selection criteria. Construction or improvement of real property or buildings fall under public works/construction rules, and must comply with numerous special requirements as specified in federal and state laws not listed in this policy. 
                  (4)  Award to a single vendor. If all bids are not rejected, the award shall be to the most responsible, responsive bidder. However, in determining which is the most responsible bidder, the county may take into consideration the bidders responsiveness to the county's requirements, the price and/or quality of any of the articles to be purchased or leased, availability of parts and service, delivery time, and those factors listed in the solicitation document. If no criterion is listed, as in the case of IFBs, award will usually go to the lowest, responsive, responsible bidder. 
                  (5)  Award to multiple bidders. The county may award to multiple bidders for the same commodity or service when the bid specifications provide for special circumstances. Special circumstances may include differences in ability to deliver, delivery time, availability of material, special loading or unloading conditions, total cost including transport or labor if not included with bid item, performance of the delivered material, location of the source, and proximity to the delivery point. The intention to do so must be indicated within the solicitation document. 
                  (6)  Tie. In the event of a tie and all pricing and qualifications are equal, the vendors are contacted and notified of the status. The vendors are invited to Dawson County to watch the county manager flip a coin to determine who wins. The second option is to open a new deck of cards and allow each to shuffle and then the county manager deals one card to each vendor. The highest card wins the award. 
                  (7)  As per O.C.G.A. § 36-10-1, all public works contracts entered into by the county governing authority with other persons on behalf of the county shall be in writing and entered on its minutes. The board of commissioners is the county governing authority. 
                  As per O.C.G.A. § 32-4-61, all highway, bridges and ferries contract for work on all or part of the county road system shall be in writing and shall be approved by resolution shall be entered on the minutes of such county. 
                  (u)  Presentation of recommendation. Once a consensus has been met and a recommendation has been made, the purchasing manager will begin the board of commissioners agenda packet which consists of the agenda request form, a PowerPoint presentation, contract and pricing as applicable. The presenter will be the department head, the subject matter expert. If the commodity crosses several departments it may be best for purchasing to present. A representative from the requesting department should attend all presentations in order to answer subject matter questions from the board. The purchasing manager shall present in the absence of the subject matter expert. The CFO shall present in the absence of both the subject matter expert and the purchasing manager. 
                  (v)  Purchase orders. 
                  (1)  A requesting department may request a purchase order for goods or services if in budget. A quote analysis form must be completed and returned with quotes between $3,000.00 and $24,999.99. No purchase order will be issued for any item/service not budgeted, $0.01 over budget or a highways, bridges ferries or public works project without first being approved by the board of commissioners, unless the procurement is for items listed under section 2-114 or section 2-111(11). Requests should not be submitted if budget is not approved or available. All account information must be provided at the time of submittal. Purchase requisitions shall be submitted to purchasing at least one week prior to the proposed purchase. A purchase order is considered a binding contract. 
                  (2)  A purchase order must be issued for all equipment over $5,000.00 (capital asset), whether new, used or procured under emergency protocols. 
                  (3)  Blanket orders may be issued for a contracted or frequently used vendor as a matter of convenience. Departments may request the issuance of a blanket PO for a specified budget amount. This amount will be encumbered but can be adjusted as needed. Blanket orders are only good for one calendar year and will need to be re-requested if additional fiscal years are needed. 
                  (4)  Every purchase order (PO) contains terms and conditions which can be found on the county's website under contracts. A PO is to be considered as an official contract. 
                  (w)  Special issues. 
                  (1)  Non-performance. 
                  a.  In the event a vendor is awarded a bid or proposal by the board of commissioners and the selected vendor fails to fulfill the conditions of the award, the board of commissioners at their discretion may award the bid or proposal to the second most responsive, responsible bidder without rebidding if within the 90 days of the bid opening. If the second vendor cannot fulfill the conditions of the award, the board of commissioners at their discretion may award the bid or proposal to the third most responsive, responsible bidder without rebidding. If the third vendor cannot fulfill the conditions of the award, the goods or services will be rebid. If expending federal and/or state funds, the purchasing department is to work with the affected department to seek direction from the grantor of these types of funds. 
                  b.  If substantial work has been performed and the vendor cannot fulfill the conditions of the award, the purchasing department will immediately notify the county manager who will take the necessary steps to ensure the safety of the public and the County. 
                  (2)  Cancellation and rejection of bids. 
                  a.  Solicitations may be canceled or may be rejected, in whole or part, as may be specified in the solicitation when it is in the best interest of the county. The reasons shall be made part of the formal bid file. Only the board of commissioners may rule on the final disposition of sealed solicitations, be it approve, reject or cancel.

                  Sec. 2-113. - Protest policy. 
                  If a vendor has a grievance regarding this policy, their bid or proposal, or award, potential or actual, the vendor must first file a written grievance with the purchasing department within ten calendar days of the award.

                  Sec. 2-115. - Contracts. 
                  (a)  Contract terms. 
                  (1)  For purposes of this policy, the award of annual contracts shall be determined by the estimated annual value of the contract for the initial term of the contract. Terms shall be clearly defined in the solicitation document. Once approval is obtained, purchasing will facilitate contract execution. 
                  (2)  All contracts must terminate at the close of each calendar year, December 31, but may have the option of automatic renewals. Term lengths, to include renewals, shall be no more than five years. This determination will be made by the purchasing manager. When a contract exhausts all renewals, the contract shall follow normal solicitation procedures. Any variation or exception must be approved by the board of commissioners. From time to time but in rare and unique occasions, a contract may be extended on a one year term. A new solicitation and contract shall be processed within the one year extended term. 
                  (b)  Execution of contracts. 
                  (1)  No contract shall be signed by County personnel other than the county manager or the board of commissioners. No changes may be made to the contract without the written permission of the signing authority by way of a contract amendment issued by the purchasing department. 
                  (2)  An original contract will be kept in the county clerk's office for records. The requesting department will be given a copy of the contract once executed. 
                  (c)  Contractual claims and invoice disputes. 
                  (1)  Contractual claims, whether for money or other relief, shall be submitted in writing no later than 60 days after final payment; however, written notice of the contractor's intention to file such claim shall have been given at the time of the occurrence or beginning of the work upon which the claim is based. Any notice or claim shall be delivered to the county manager and shall include a description of the factual basis for the claim and a statement of the amounts claimed or other relief requested. The county manager shall render a decision on the claim and shall notify the contractor within 30 days of receipt of the claim. The contractor may appeal the decision of the county manager to the board of commissioners by providing written notice to the county manager, within 15 days of the date of the decision. The board shall render a decision on the claim within 60 days of the date of receipt of the appeal notice and such decision shall be final. Invoices for all services or goods provided by the contractor shall be delivered to the county no later than 30 days following the conclusion of the work or delivery of the goods unless other terms are prescribed by contract. 
                  (2)  Any changes to the overall dollar limit of the contracted amount must be approved by the county manager and/or the board of commissioners. The final decision is with whoever approved the original contract. 
                  (3)  It is the requesting department's responsibility to ensure invoices are correct prior to approval and payment. Invoices which are green stamped and approved for payment by the department head will be paid as reported. All invoice disputes should be handled at the department level unless there is a pattern of non-responsiveness or incorrectness that calls the contract into question. 
                  (d)  Notice of award. When the board has voted to award a solicitation contract, the purchasing manager will issue a notice of award letter and a contract to the awarded vendor for execution. 
                  (e)  Notice to proceed. When the contract(s) have been executed and required paperwork and bonds, if applicable, have been received by purchasing; a notice to proceed letter will be issued to the contractor. The letter must contain the county staff contact information responsible for meeting with the contractor and the notice to proceed date of the contract work that will kick off the contract term. A copy of the NTP letter, executed contract, along with a purchase order showing budget has been encumbered will be forwarded to all parties involved in the contract. No work may begin prior to this documentation being obtained. 
                  (f)  Change orders. Change orders are allowed in the event the scope of work has been changed or unforeseen occurrences arise. All change orders must be initiated in an amendment by the purchasing department and approved by the project manager and the county manager, if change order is under the previously budgeted amount. If a change order total is or if the change order will increase the contract total to be over the budgeted amount and/or is not previously budgeted and/or a highways, bridges, ferries or public works project, the approval must be made by the board of commissioners at a consent meeting. The invoice must reflect the change order by line item. Purchasing will update the original purchase order to reflect the change order once approved. Budget must be available for the change order prior to the request being submitted. 
                  The board of commissioners may choose to award highways, bridges, ferries or public works projects with a not-to-exceed amount to streamline change orders. 
                  (g)  Termination. It is the responsibility of the user department to notify purchasing of non-performance issues with the vendor. All concerns need to be in writing. If at any point, the department recommends cancellation of a contract, the department should submit in writing the cause for the termination. Purchasing will confirm whether the contract can be terminated early. Purchasing will send a letter to the vendor terminating the contract with an effective date. A copy will be sent to the department and the county clerk. If a contract is terminated early, the user department will assist purchasing in writing the new solicitation to help protect for future occurrences. 
                  (h)  Payment. All invoices associated to contracts shall be paid through AP billing and not on the county purchasing card (p-card). Doing so will ensure that vendors and purchases can be tracked and managed through the accounting software. 
                  (Ord. of 1-17-2019) 
                  Sec. 2-116. - Contract vendor files. 
                  (a)  Contract vendor files are to be maintained by purchasing. A copy of the contract, purchase order, annual reviews (if warranted), E-Verify, W9 and certificate of insurance should be kept on file. 
                  (b)  A W9 is required on all vendors when paid over $600.00 in one year or more than once a year. An updated W9 is required when the information has changed. 
                  (c)  The State of Georgia under O.C.G.A. § 13-10-91 requires all contractors complete an E-Verify affidavit if the following pertains: 
                  (1)  For the purchase of services over $2,499.99, vendors must complete and return the E-Verify for each occurrence, not an annual accrual. If they have one or fewer employees, they are exempt but must complete the form with this information reported; 
                  (2)  For bids, all vendors must be E-Verify compliant; or 
                  (3)  For Contractors (individuals and not LLC or corporation businesses as example) performing services under Title 26, Title 43 or the State Bar of Georgia are exempt. These contractors must submit an exempt form and other forms of identification as required. 
                  (d)  The E-Verify number is between four and six digits long devoid of letters. 
                  (e)  A certificate of liability insurance, or COI, should be kept on file for all vendors performing work on Dawson County property or in the name of Dawson County Government. Vendors should send updated COIs to the purchasing department as the policy is renewed. In the event a large project or a project that creates a high liability for the county arises, a new COI may be requested to confirm insurance coverage. 
                  (f)  If a bidder or vendor does not have workman's compensation insurance and it is believed that the county will pay a premium for the service on the next audit, Dawson County may add the amounts historically charged for those services to the county to the bid price for the purposes of identifying the low bid. It is understood this may result in another vendor being selected. Dawson County tries to limit risk and additional insurance costs.

                  Sec. 2-117. - Vendor annual review. 
                  Annual reviews of each local contract should be performed by the department directors and purchasing. Purchasing will send out yearly reviews to end-user departments for an honest review of the vendor's performance over the last 12 month period. Departments should return reviews in a timely manner. If a vendor is not recommended for renewal, department should notify purchasing immediately. These reviews may be in the form of emails between the department directors and purchasing. 
                  If a department director or their employees experience problems with the contractor during the course of a term, notification to the purchasing department shall be sent immediately. Purchasing shall work with the contractor to cure all issues. If issues do not warrant cancellation of the contract, purchasing shall maintain the complaints in the contract file. These complaints should be considered during the renewal option process. 
                  (Ord. of 1-17-2019) 
                  Sec. 2-118. - Records management. 
                  All requisitions, competitive bids, quotations, purchase orders, contracts and other pertinent documentation of purchasing shall be maintained by the purchasing department in accordance with regulations and procedures prescribed in the purchasing policy, records retention resolution and the retention schedules for local government records as published by the Georgia Secretary of State, Department of Archives and History. 
                  (Ord. of 1-17-2019) 
                  Sec. 2-119. - Prohibited actions. 
                  (a)  Circumventing bid ordinance or purchasing policy. 
                  (1)  Personnel should never knowingly and/or intentionally take action that would circumvent the bid ordinance or purchasing policy. 
                  (2)  Personnel should not make purchases or split purchases between AP billing and their P-Card, to circumvent the purchasing policy. 
                  (b)  Stringing. 
                  (1)  Stringing is defined as knowingly structuring the purchase of goods and/or services to avoid the purchase or contract being subject to competitive bidding requirements. This process is against the laws of the State of Georgia. The process does not require that the items, or the provider, be the same; but rather that the items be "like items," and the vendors be from the same general vendor/provider group. 
                  (2)  Purchases shall not be divided so as to create lower purchase amounts and therefore avoid some requirements of this policy. Whether or not a proposed purchase constitutes artificial division or stringing shall be determined by the purchasing department and the county manager has the final decision. 
                  (3)  If a single purchase includes both goods and services, the entire purchase will be treated as being in the category with sufficient written documentation as back up. 
                  (Ord. of 1-17-2019) 
                  Sec. 2-120. - Nondiscrimination. 
                  The County does not discriminate in the solicitation or award of contracts because of race, religion, color, gender, age, disability or national origin of the bidder or offeror. It is the responsibility of county employees, particularly those employees involved in procurement, to ensure that all vendors are permitted equal opportunity and access to participate in county procurement opportunities, and that no vendor be denied equal opportunity or access because of race, religion, color, gender, or national origin.

                  Sec. 2-121. - Local small business initiative. 
                  (a)  Purpose and scope. 
                  (1)  Giving preference to local suppliers, even if it means spending a little more, can actually benefit a county's finances. Dollars spent locally generate additional economic activity even beyond the value of the initial contract as the local supplier in turn sources goods and services locally. Each additional dollar that circulates locally boosts economic activity, employment, and ultimately tax revenue. A study in Arizona found that using local independent suppliers for state contracts results in three times the economic benefit of bids fulfilled through national chains. 
                  (2)  Local small business initiative (LSBI) is a Dawson County program designed to promote opportunities to local small businesses located in Dawson County. 
                  (3)  The LSBI program is designed to return as much taxpayer money to the local economy, in a relatively short time span, as possible while at the same time foster inclusiveness with the county's procurement activities and a goal to provide more opportunities for Dawson County businesses. 
                  (b)  Definition of local small business. 
                  (1)  Local small business shall mean a business which has its principal office located in and having a street address within Dawson County for at least six months immediately prior to the issuance of the quote/bid/proposal. Post office boxes (to include mailing/shipping center addresses) are not eligible and shall not be used for the purpose of establishing a physical address. 
                  (2)  Must hold a valid business license required by the county and have no outstanding or unresolved fees, fines or penalties due to Dawson County. 
                  (3)  Not have more than 25 employees, and of which at least 33 percent of those employees have their primary residence in Dawson County, or, if the business has no employees, the business shall be at least 51 percent owned by one or more persons whose primary residence in Dawson County. 
                  (4)  Have a banking relationship with a bank located in Dawson County. 
                  (5)  Average annual gross receipts of five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) or less over the previous three years. 
                  (6)  Must certify under oath to the above criteria upon submission for any bid, solicitation, or proposal to Dawson County. 
                  (c)  The LSBI policy will not be applicable for the following types of purchases, bids, or solicitations. 
                  (1)  Goods or services provided under a cooperative purchasing agreement or inter-local agreement; 
                  (2)  Purchases or contracts which are funded in whole or part by a governmental entity and the laws, regulations, or policies governing such funding prohibit application of preference; 
                  (3)  Purchases made or contracts let under emergency or non-competitive situations or for legal services; 
                  (4)  Projects over $100,000.00. 
                  (d)  Affidavit. The county will accept an affidavit that a business meets the county's standards to be considered a local small business. The county, in its sole discretion, may request additional information from the business to support its claim of being a local small business. The purchasing department will be required to review the affidavit and request additional information as necessary to ensure the LSBI criteria are satisfied. The county will notify a business of acceptance of LSBI certification. 
                  (e)  How incentive works. Under any applicable solicitation or bid, vendors desiring to receive local preference under the LSBI policy will be required to affirmatively demonstrate via affidavit that they satisfy all pertinent requirements. Any vendor who fails to submit the required affidavit shall be automatically excluded from LSBI consideration. Vendors shall submit the affidavit with each solicitation or bid proposal. The affidavit contemplated under this policy is valid only for the submitted solicitation or bid, and must be reaffirmed and resubmitted for each subsequent solicitation of bid. 
                  For any solicitation that is under $100,000.00 the local small business (as demonstrated via affidavit) that submits a responsive, responsible price, a local preference credit of three percent. 
                  (f)  Waiver. The application of local preference to a particular purchase, contract, bid, solicitation or category of contracts may be waived by the Dawson County board of county commissioners in its sole discretion. The promulgation of this policy is not intended nor should it be construed as created a right or property interest in local preference or in the local preference credit.

                  (h)  A notice of each initial application to sell distilled spirits (whether for package sales or for consumption on the premises) shall be advertised in the official legal organ of the county once during each of two weeks during the 30 days preceding consideration of the application. In the event it is determined at or before the time of consideration that there has been a failure as to publication of the required notice, then the appropriate action will be to delay consideration of the application until proper publication is done. The notice shall contain the name of the applicant, the type of license sought, and the location of the proposed licensed premises, as well as the expected date for consideration (including a statement that such date is subject to change). 
                  (i)  An applicant for any type of license under this chapter, including an employee permit, must resolve any pending alcohol related criminal charges before his or her application will be considered. 
                  (j)  If an applicant is notified of a date, time and place to appear before the county commission or its designee in connection with consideration of an initial application, or a renewal application, or a reinstatement request, or a possible disciplinary action such as suspension, probation or revocation, and the applicant fails to so appear, and if the failure to appear is not excused by the county commission or its designee, then the commission or its designee may deny the application, or may consider the proposed disciplinary action unopposed, or may delay further proceedings as the commission or its designee determines to be appropriate. 
                  (k)  (1)  Consideration of all initial applications and transfer of location applications under section 6-94 of this Code, shall be done by the county commission at an open meeting of the commission unless the commission by written policy, resolution or amendment to this ordinance designates the director or another person or entity to consider and decide such categories of possible actions. 
                  (2)  The county commission shall consider and decide all proposed suspensions, revocations, or other potential disciplinary matters as to any license in an open meeting of the commission, with the exception of emergency suspensions done on a temporary basis, which may be done by the county manager, fire chief, building official or sheriff for public safety reasons under section 6-106(c) of this Code, until the commission is able to schedule a hearing on the matter for its consideration of the suspension. 
                  (3)  All applicants/licensees shall appear before the commission at the time of its consideration of any of the foregoing matters, either in person, or by the presence of a registered agent who is suitable to answer all questions which may arise concerning the action under consideration. Such appearance by someone other than the agent must be approved in advance by county staff. Failure to appear may result in such action as the county commission or its designee deems appropriate, including delay to allow re-scheduling, or denial of an application or change, or imposition of the proposed disciplinary action. 
                  (4)  Applications for license renewals; special event alcohol permits; transfer of ownership; issuance or disciplinary action as to employee permits; whether a license has been abandoned due to non-use under section 6-95 below; and all other administrative decisions not specifically committed to the discretion of the commission, shall be determined by the director or his or her designee, subject to right of the applicant or licensee or permit holder to appeal an adverse decision to the board of commissioners by filing a notice of appeal stating the grounds for appeal and relevant supporting facts. Notice of appeal must be filed with the director and must be received in the county's planning office within ten business days of the date of the director/designee decision from which complaint/appeal is made. In the event this chapter requires the director to issue a written notice of decision, then the appeal time shall commence on the date when the director's notice is received by the licensee/permitee. 
                  (5)  Notices of all kinds from the director/designee or the commission may be forwarded to licensee/permittee's address of record by hand delivery; or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; or by private express delivery with proof of delivery. Notices will be deemed to be received when actually received by licensee/permittee as evidenced by the return receipt signed by licensee/permittee or other person on behalf of licensee/permittee. If hand delivered, the delivery or refusal may be evidenced by the signed statement of the person who delivered or attempted to deliver the notice. If the notice is returned un-delivered because licensee/permittee refused to accept delivery, or failed to pick up a notice despite notice from the U.S. Postal Service or private express carrier as referred to above, or is returned marked "addressee unknown" of "forwarding order expired" then that will be deemed to constitute delivery to the addressee if the notice was addressed to the most current address of record. Refusal to accept shall be deemed delivery of the notice as of the date of refusal, and failure to pick up shall be deemed delivery as of the date of notice of attempted delivery (or the date of final notice if more than one notice of attempted delivery or notice to pick up is given by the U.S.P.S. or private carrier). 
                  (l)  The commission or its designee may table or delay further consideration of an application, disciplinary action, or other matter in order to obtain further information or for other reason if it or its designee deems such tabling or a delay appropriate.

                  Sec. 6-91. - Granting applications; provisional licenses; special terms and conditions. 
                  (a)  When licenses in accord with the terms hereof are initially issued, if more than one applicant seeks to obtain a license within an area where only one license can be issued, then the board of commissioners shall determine to whom the license shall be issued and may consider the following provisions in addition to the provisions set forth in section 6-93 hereof: 
                  (1)  Whether the applicant owns the property where the licensed business will be located; 
                  (2)  The experience of the applicant operating retail package stores; and 
                  (3)  The distance from the proposed location to any church building, school building, day care facility or alcohol treatment facility with those locations being a greater distance from a church building, a school building, a day care facility or an alcohol treatment facility being given preference if the commission determines such preference to be appropriate. 
                  (b)  In deciding whether or not an application will be granted or denied, the commission may consider the qualifications of the applicant, the location of the business and its proximity to other enterprises. The commission may also consider: 
                  (1)  The effect that the establishment would have on the neighborhood surrounding the establishment in terms of traffic congestion and the general character of the neighborhood, as well as the effect the establishment would have on the value of properties surrounding the site; and 
                  (2)  The number of alcoholic beverage licenses already granted in the neighborhood. 
                  (c)  Approval of an application for a license, renewal of a license, reinstatement of a license, or allowance to continue operation under a license in conjunction with adverse action such as suspension or probation, or in lieu of immediate revocation of proposed or imposed, may be conditioned upon the licensee's agreement to and compliance with conditions provided for by the commission, which may be modified during the course of the term of the license as the commission deems appropriate. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to: substitution of a different licensee, manager or agent; non-participation of a named individual in the ownership, operation or management of the licensed business; restriction of days or hours of operation; modification of the licensed premises or of the portion of the property upon which alcoholic beverages may be sold, served or consumed; changes as to staffing; posting of a bond with adequate security to guarantee compliance with state law and the provisions of this chapter as well as any conditions placed upon any license; conditions as to reporting or record keeping; conditions requiring licensee to clean up trash in the vicinity of the licensed premises on a regular basis; or other reasonable conditions, requirements or restrictions as may be prescribed by the commission. 
                  (d)  Approval of a license may be provisional, that is, temporary and based upon conditions requiring or related to carrying out construction, renovation, alteration or improvement of the proposed licensed premises. Terms and conditions which are hereby imposed automatically on a provisional license are as follows: submittal of plans as required by the director, the building official, the fire department, the health department and any other such official or authority; obtaining all appropriate inspections; payment of all required fees; and securing of all necessary certifications and approvals. Any of the foregoing authorities may impose further reasonable conditions. The licensee may not keep or store alcoholic beverages on site, and may not commence operations, until all such conditions are met.

                  Sec. 6-92. - Denial of an application. 
                  (a)  The county commission shall provide written notice to any applicant whose application is denied under the provisions of this chapter. Such written notification shall set forth in reasonable detail the reasons for such denial and shall advise the applicant of the right to appeal under the provisions of this chapter. 
                  (b)  In all instances in which an initial application is denied under the provisions of this chapter, the applicant may not reapply for a license for at least one year from the date of such denial. 
                  (Ord. of 5-17-2018(1), § 1) 
                  Sec. 6-93. - Qualifications of applicants, licensees and resident agents. 
                  (a)  Wholesale. Wholesale licenses shall be issued only to those persons who are licensed by the State of Georgia to sell and distribute malt beverages, wines, or distilled spirits at wholesale. 
                  (b)  Retail package sales and consumption by the drink on the premises. In order to qualify for the issuance of a retail license, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (1)  No license for the sale of alcoholic beverages shall be granted to any person who is not a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. The applicant must submit all electronic and other verification forms and identification determined by the director to be applicable. The applicant must not be less than 21 years of age. Applicants may choose to employ or designate a qualified registered agent for the administration of the license, but the agent is not permitted to make the application in place of the proposed licensee. All individual applicants who do not reside in Dawson County, and all partnerships, limited partnerships, limited liability companies, and corporate applicants must designate a qualified registered agent, residing in Dawson County. 
                  (2)  If the applicant is a partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company, or corporation, then the provisions of this section shall apply to all its partners, members, officers and majority stockholders. In the case of a corporation, the license shall be issued jointly to the corporation and the majority stockholder, if an individual. If the majority stockholder is not an individual, then the license shall be issued jointly to the corporation and its agent registered under the provisions of this chapter. In the case of a partnership, the license will be issued to all the partners owning at least 20 percent of the partnership; or if no partner owns 20 percent of the partnership, then the general partner, managing partner or the partner with the greatest ownership shall be licensed. In the case of a limited partnership the license shall be issued in the name of the general partner(s). In the case of a limited liability company the license shall be issued jointly in the name of the LLC and its managing member(s), or if there are no managing members, then jointly in the name of the LLC and the individual designated as manager by the LLC in current filings with the Secretary of State. 
                  (3)  If the applicant is an unincorporated nonprofit club, then the managing agent may be an officer of the organization rather than a full-time employee if such managing agent is qualified in accord with this section. 
                  (4)  No person shall be granted any alcoholic beverage license if, during the two years immediately preceding the application, the person has either been convicted of, pled guilty to, pled nolo contendere to, or been released from parole or probation for any of the following offences: any crime involving moral turpitude; illegal gambling; illegal possession or sale of controlled substances; illegal possession or sale of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer of alcohol to minors in a manner contrary to law; keeping a place of prostitution; pandering; pimping; public indecency; prostitution; solicitation or sodomy; or any sexually related crime. At the time an application is submitted for any alcoholic beverage license, the applicant shall, by a duly sworn affidavit, certify that neither the applicant nor any of the owners of the establishment has been so convicted or released in the two years preceding the application. An applicant's first time conviction for illegal possession of alcohol as a misdemeanor, or a violation of a county ordinance shall not, alone, make an applicant ineligible for a license. If, after a license has been issued, any applicant, partner or officer used in the sale or dispensing of any alcoholic beverage, is convicted or pleads guilty or nolo contendere to any of the offenses enumerated herein, then the license shall be immediately revoked and cancelled. 
                  (5)  No license for the sale of alcoholic beverages shall be granted to any person convicted under any federal, state or local law of any felony, within two years prior to the filing of application for such license. 
                  (6)  It shall be unlawful for any county employee directly involved in the issuance of alcoholic beverage licenses under this chapter to have any whole, partial or beneficial interest in any license to sell alcoholic beverages in the county. 
                  (7)  No license for the sale of alcoholic beverages shall be granted to any person who has had any license issued under the police powers of the county previously revoked within two years prior to the filing of the application. 
                  (8)  The county commission may decline to issue a license when any person having any ownership interest in the operation of such place of business or control over such place of business does not meet the same character requirements as set forth in this section for the licensee. 
                  (9)  Any registered agent under this chapter must be an individual who resides in Dawson County and qualifies under the same terms as would an individual applicant for license (that is, all qualifications as to character, criminal and other personal history matters); must consent in writing to serve as resident agent; and must be approved as such by the director. In the event a registered agent ceases to qualify under the terms of this chapter, or the agency is revoked by the licensee, or the agent resigns or declines to continue to serve as agent, the licensee shall notify the director promptly in writing that the individual who has been serving will no longer be agent and shall name another qualified individual residing in Dawson County to serve, subject to the director's approval. As to any proposed initial or replacement agent the applicant/licensee shall be responsible for providing all information, records or data requested by the director for consideration in the approval process. 
                  (10)  All applicants for any alcoholic beverage license must be of good character, and all operators, managers, clerks, or other employees shall be of like character. Corporate or firm applicants shall be of good business reputation. 
                  (11)  A license application may be denied to any applicant for any alcoholic beverage license if the applicant lacks adequate financial participation in the proposed business to direct and manage its affairs, or if the application is intended to serve as a surrogate for a person or persons who would not otherwise qualify for a license for any reason whatsoever. 
                  (12)  The county commission may, in its discretion, consider any extenuating circumstances that may reflect favorably or unfavorably on the applicant, application, agent or the proposed location of the business. If circumstances are such that granting of the license would not be in the best interest of the public health, safety, welfare, and morals, then such circumstances may be grounds for denying the application. 
                  (13)  For purposes of this chapter, a conviction or plea of guilty or nolo contendere shall be ignored as to any offense for which the defendant was allowed to avail himself or herself of the Georgia First Offender Act (O.C.G.A. § 42-8-60 et seq.), as amended. Except, however, that any such offense shall not be ignored if the defendant violated any term of probation imposed by the court granting first offender treatment or committed another crime and the sentencing court entered an adjudication of guilt.

                  Sec. 6-94. - Transferability of license/change in ownership. 
                  (a)  Individuals. In the event of a change of ownership of a business for which an individual has been issued a license, the new owner, if desiring a license, must meet the qualifications specified in section 6-93 and must file an application as provided in section 6-90 and tender with the application the investigative and administrative fee as provided in section 6-26 and any license fee that may be due. 
                  (b)  Partnerships or corporations. In the event of a change of any ownership interest in a business which is owned or operated by a partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company, or corporation and for which a license has been issued, the licensee shall report such change to the county commission in writing within five days. "The term "change of ownership interest" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, any change in: 
                  (1)  Division of profits and/or losses; 
                  (2)  Division of net gross or sales; 
                  (3)  Method of paying or amount of rent paid; 
                  (4)  Ownership of leased premises, or buildings or land used in the business; 
                  (5)  Members of a partnership; 
                  (6)  Stockholders of corporate stock; and 
                  (7)  Management. 
                  (c)  If, as a result of any change of ownership interest, the licensee would not qualify under other provisions of this chapter for the issuance of a license, then the license issued to the licensee shall be subject to revocation and shall not be subject to renewal. 
                  (d)  All applications for transfer of a license to a new licensee or new location shall be accompanied by the transfer fee, together with an investigative and administrative fee. If the transfer is not approved, then the transfer fee will be refunded, but the investigative and administrative fee will not be refunded. Ownership changes will be decided by the director, subject to right of appeal to the commission by a dissatisfied applicant, and changes of location shall be decided by the commission. 
                  (e)  Upon the death of a licensee, the executor or administrator of the licensee's estate may continue to operate under the license for the balance of the calendar year without payment of any additional fee or may delegate the operation of the business to another person if the person operating under the license, whether the executor, administrator, or delegate, would otherwise be qualified as a licensee under the provisions of this chapter. 
                  (f)  Any proposed change of location must be approved by the county commission after submission of all required transfer fees, administrative fees and investigative fees, and all information and data required by the director, which shall include, but not be limited to, all location data that would be required on an initial application under this chapter, such as the certified survey showing distances to specified properties, and the floor plan showing the areas designated for storage, preparation, service, display, sales and consumption of alcohol and the location of any bars. The director may also require full current information on the applicant and other persons as for an initial application. The transfer application shall be treated and considered in the same manner as an initial application except there shall be a renewal fee and not a new license fee if the change is to take effect after December 31 of the year the change application is submitted. There will be a transfer fee and no additional license fee if the change is to be effective during the current year. The normal renewal application and fees associated with renewal shall be due notwithstanding pendency of any transfer application under this article. The commission is authorized to consider any factors that might be considered in approving or disapproving an initial application. If the application is for sale of distilled spirits, any notice publication requirements as for new applications shall apply.

                  Sec. 6-95. - Automatic license forfeiture for nonuse; conditional or provisional issuance. 
                  (a)  A license issued pursuant to this chapter shall be valid only so long as the licensee is actually engaged in the permitted sale of alcoholic beverages. Any holder of any license under this chapter who shall for a period of 30 days after the license has been issued cease to operate the business and sale of the product or products authorized shall, after the 30-day period, automatically forfeit the license without the necessity of any further action by the county. The director shall cause a notice of forfeiture to be mailed or delivered to the address of record of the licensee, which shall notify the licensee of its right to appeal the decision of the director to the board of commissioners by submitting a notice of appeal. The notice of appeal shall be delivered so as to be received by the director within ten business days of the date of the licensee's receipt of the notice of forfeiture. The notice of appeal shall set forth the grounds of appeal including any relevant facts in support of the appeal. 
                  (b)  A license may be conditionally or provisionally issued for a location upon which the licensee intends to build an appropriate building or renovate an existing structure, and due to the construction or renovation, does not anticipate commencing operations within 90 days of issuance of the license. In the event a license is issued subject to such a condition, the licensee will be determined to have ceased doing business and thus forfeited the license if necessary permits are not obtained and substantial work completed within six months after the date the license is approved. If the licensee has not completed building/renovation, and obtained all required inspections and permits for occupancy, and obtained a business license, and commenced operation of the licensed business within one year following the date of issuance of the license, then the licensee will be deemed to have abandoned the license, which is then forfeited automatically by operation of this section. Provided, however, the holder of any license currently issued and existing as of the adoption of this amendment to the alcohol ordinance, but for which no operations under the license have been commenced, shall have a period of two years from the adoption of the amendment prior to such forfeiture in which to commence operations. A renewal license shall not be granted for a premises that are not currently in operation pursuant to the license other than subject to the terms of this section. Forfeitures under this subsection shall be subject to a right of notice from the director and of appeal to the commission in the same manner and with the same time limitation as set forth in the preceding subsection. Any existing package sales license holder whose license has been renewed prior to adoption of this amended ordinance, but which has not commenced operations as of the adoption of this amendment shall not be considered for purposes of the one mile minimum distance of separation rule set forth in section 6-108(b).

                  Sec. 6-96. - Licensees to maintain a copy of this chapter; employees to be familiar with terms; licensee responsible for violations; age requirements; employees and managers generally 
                  (a)  Each alcoholic beverage dealer licensed under this chapter shall keep a copy of this chapter upon the licensed premises and shall instruct any person working there with respect to the terms of this chapter; and each licensee, the licensee's agents, and the licensee's employees selling alcoholic beverages shall at all times be familiar with the terms of this chapter. The licensee is responsible for assuring such familiarity and is responsible for any violations committed by any employee or manager due to ignorance of the terms of this chapter or of State law. 
                  (b)  The regulations in this section as to employees and managers shall apply to all establishments seeking and holding a license under this chapter unless specifically provided otherwise: 
                  (1)  No person shall be employed in an establishment holding a license issued under this chapter unless said person meets the following minimum age requirements for issuance of an employee permit: 
                  a.  For employment in an establishment serving alcoholic beverages by the drink for consumption on-premises, a person must be at least 18 years of age. 
                  b.  For employment in an establishment licensed for sale of distilled spirits by the package for off-premises consumption, a person must be at least 21 years of age. This requirement shall not apply to persons employed solely as a busboy, cook, dishwasher or janitor. 
                  c.  For employment in an establishment licensed for sale of beer, wine or beer and wine by the package for off-premise consumption, a person must be at least 18 years of age. This requirement shall not apply to employees of a grocery store or drug store. 
                  (2)  No person shall be employed in any capacity at an establishment holding a license issued under this chapter until such person has been issued a permit by the director indicating that the person is eligible for such employment. 
                  (3)  No permit shall be issued by the director to any person until such time as a signed application has been filed by such person with the director, and the appropriate fees have been paid, and a search of the criminal record of the applicant is completed. The application shall include, but not be limited to, the name, date of birth, address, citizenship status and prior arrest record of the person, though the fact of an arrest record shall be used for investigative purposes only and shall give rise to no presumption or inference of guilt. Due to the inclusion of arrest information, these applications shall be regarded as confidential and shall not be produced for public inspection without a court order. Applications must be accompanied by a valid government issued I.D. card (for example, a driver's license or state-issued I.D. card). 
                  (4)  The director shall have the search made relative to any criminal record of the person. If there is no record of a disqualifying conviction or of a violation of this chapter, the director shall issue a permit to the person stating that the person is eligible for employment. If it is found that the person is not eligible for employment, the director shall notify the person in writing that the person is not eligible for employment, the cause for such denial, and that such individual has the right to appeal such decision to the board of commissioners. 
                  (5)  No person shall be granted a permit unless it appears to the satisfaction of the director that such person has not been convicted or pled guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling or illegal possession or sale of controlled substances or the illegal sale or possession of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer of alcoholic beverages to minors in a manner contrary to law, keeping a place of prostitution, solicitation of sodomy or any sexually related crime within a period of two years of the date of application and has been released from parole or probation. A person's first time conviction for illegal possession of alcohol as a misdemeanor or violation of a county ordinance shall not by itself make a person ineligible for a permit required by this chapter. No person shall be granted a permit required by this chapter who has been convicted, pled guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any federal, state or local law for any felony within two years preceding, or any time subsequent to, the date of application and has not been released from parole or probation prior to the filing for application for such permit. For purposes of this chapter, a conviction or plea of guilt or nolo contendere shall be ignored as to any offense where the conviction or plea was entered pursuant to the Georgia First Offender Act (O.C.G.A. § 42-8-60 et seq.), as amended, so long as the first offender status has not been revoked. 
                  (6)  The permit required by this chapter shall be issued for a period of one calendar year from the date of the original application. Employee permits are issued for work for the specific type of licensed establishment as indicated on the employee permit application and may not be used at another category of licensed establishment. The permit must be either on the premises or in the possession of the individual to whom it is issued while that individual is working at the licensed establishment. This permit must be available for inspection by members of the sheriff's office, the director's office or the county code enforcement staff. 
                  (7)  No person shall be issued a permit if it is determined that the person falsified, concealed or covered up any material fact by any device, trick or scheme while making application to the marshal's office for the permit required by this chapter. If it is determined that a person is in violation of this subsection and a permit is denied for this reason, then 30 calendar days must elapse from the date of notification per certified mailing before a new application and fee may be resubmitted. 
                  (8)  All permits issued through administrative error can be terminated and seized by the marshal, his designee or by the county commission or its designee. 
                  (9)  Replacement permits may be issued within 30 days of original date upon paying one-half of the fee charged for the original permit. After 30 days of the original application date, a new application and fee must be submitted. 
                  (10)  All permits issued under this chapter remain the property of Dawson County and shall be produced for inspection upon the demand of any deputy or designee of the sheriff's office or employee of the marshal's office, or the county commission's staff. 
                  (11)  No licensee shall allow any person required to hold an employee permit to work on the premises unless that person's current, valid permit is on the premises or the person has it in his or her possession.

                  (4)  Becomes disqualified under this chapter to hold a license;

                  (a)  There is available to the director and commission a range of potential disciplinary options concerning actions, misconduct, violations of this chapter or other laws, and failures to take required action on the part of licensees, their agents and employees, and permit holders.

The same applies to disciplinary actions which may be taken by the director as to employee permit holders. Factors which may be considered as to licensees or employee permit holders include any factors set forth in this chapter as to mitigating or aggravating violations of this chapter or any other rules, regulations or laws, including, but not limited to, the following: number and severity of offenses, whether there have been other offenses of a similar nature, whether there have been other offenses of any kind within the preceding three years, whether the problem, condition or violation has been remedied or corrected, whether the licensee took appropriate steps prior to the violation to assure that staff and employees were aware of the requirements of the law, whether the violation was committed by the licensee or manager as opposed to by a non-managerial employee, whether the licensee or permit holder recognizes and acknowledges his or her misconduct or actions leading to disciplinary action, and whether a greater or lesser severity of discipline is likely to prevent future violations. 
                  (c)  A licensee or permit holder under this chapter who is notified of proposed disciplinary action may accept the discipline as proposed by executing a written acceptance which waives any right the licensee/permit holder might otherwise have to a hearing. 
                  (d)  Disciplinary action shall be deemed final under this chapter when a written acceptance and waiver is executed as provided for in this section, or, if none is executed, at the time a written notice of decision is mailed to or hand delivered to the disciplined licensee or permit holder.

                  (a)  The following shall be grounds, in addition to any other grounds set forth in the preceding section, for the suspension of a license issued under this chapter for such period of time as the board of commissioners shall, in its sole discretion, determine appropriate: 
                  (1)  A violation, as demonstrated by evidence or by any adjudication of guilt as described in subsection 6-105(b)(3) above by the licensee (or any officer, owner, manager, agent or employee of licensee) of any state or federal law or regulation, or any provision of this chapter or the regulations promulgated under its authority; 
                  (2)  The failure of the licensee and employees or agents of the licensee to promptly report to the sheriff's office any violation of law/breach of peace, disturbance, or altercation occurring on or near the licensee's premises;

                  (7)  To knowingly sell or offer to sell malt beverages or wines or distilled spirits to any person under the age of 21 years. In any case where a reasonable person could reasonably be in doubt as to whether or not the person seeking to obtain an alcoholic beverage is actually 21 years of age or older, it shall be the duty of the person selling or otherwise furnishing said malt beverages or wine to request and be furnished with proper identification in order to verify the age of such person. Failure to make such a request and to verify the purchaser's age may be considered by the trier of fact in determining whether any sale to an underage person was made knowingly.

                  e.  Any aggravating circumstances or failure by the licensee to take remedial or corrective steps. 
                  f.  The licensee's history of compliance or noncompliance with applicable alcohol related laws and regulations. 
                  g.  Whether the licensee established practices and procedures to prevent the violation from occurring and established procedures to properly train and supervise employees to prevent the violation from occurring. 
                  h.  The board, or director in circumstances where the director may have authority to impose adverse action on a license, permit, licensee or permit holder, may do so upon a progressive discipline basis, such that, for example, first, second and third violations result in successively more severe action. The board or director shall be authorized to utilize a more severe adverse action without intervening violations or intervening steps dependent upon the factors which may otherwise be considered under this section, as provided for in section 6-105.1 herein. 
                  (c)  Any license suspension for greater than 30 days shall require the licensee to remove all alcoholic beverages from the licensed premises.

No sales or service of alcoholic beverages (neither for on-premises nor off-premises consumption) is allowed upon any licensed premises during any period of suspension, nor is "bring your own bottle" practice or brown bagging permitted during suspension. 
                  (d)  Whenever this chapter permits the board of commissioners to suspend or revoke a license, then the Sheriff of Dawson County, or the fire chief, the building official or the county manager may, on a temporary emergency basis suspend the license and order the licensee to cease operations until the matter may be scheduled for hearing before the board of commissioners. This may be done only upon a finding by the said official that temporary suspension as in the best interest of the public for safety, health and/or public welfare reasons. If any of the said officials shall exercise this suspension authority the decision to do so, the reasons for the emergency suspension, and the anticipated duration of the suspension, shall be provided to the licensee or its agent in written form as promptly as practicable.

                  (e)  Whenever a period of suspension is imposed under this chapter, the commission may determine in its discretion that at the end of the suspension the licensee may only renew operations in accordance with reasonable conditions imposed by the commission either permanently or during a probationary period set by the commission. 
                  (f)  Whenever the commission would be authorized in its discretion to revoke or suspend a license, then it may instead impose a period of probation during which the licensee must operate under such conditions, limitations or restrictions, and subject to such monitoring, as the commission deems appropriate.

                  (b)  The requirement for approval is that the patio/open area be enclosed by a fence, wall, or some other structure providing for public ingress/egress only through the main licensed premises. The purpose of this requirement is to prevent a customer from leaving the outside sales area with an open drink without the licensee's knowledge. A parking lot shall not qualify as such an open area. 
                  (c)  The height of such structure shall be a minimum of three and one-half feet above the patio floor, but the structure does not have to be solid or restrict visibility into or out of the patio/open sales area. It must be permitted and approved by the county's building inspection department and the county's fire department as required by governing regulations or codes. 
                  (d)  The only exit from this area is to be through the licensed establishment's main premises and through an approved fire exit, not for general public use unless an emergency exists. The fire exit should be of the type that sounds an alarm so that the establishment will be alerted in the event of unauthorized use when no emergency exists. 
                  (e)  If a licensee desires a patio/open sales area at an existing licensed structure, plans will be reviewed and approved on an individual basis by the director with a right of appeal to the commission in the event of a denial.

However, nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the carrying out of wine or malt beverages for consumption on a golf course or the sale of wine or malt beverages outside on a golf course to golfers. Customers may not consume alcoholic beverages, or carry open alcoholic beverage containers, in parking lots of the licensed premises. 
                  (b)  It is prohibited for customers to gather outside an alcoholic beverage establishment and consume alcoholic beverages.

                  (b)  A partially consumed bottle of wine that is to be removed from the premises must be securely resealed by the licensee or its employees before removal from the premises. 
                  (c)  The partially consumed bottle of wine shall be placed in a bag or other container that is secured in such a manner that it is visibly apparent if the container has been subsequently opened or tampered with and a dated receipt for the bottle of wine and meal shall be provided by the licensee and attached to the container. 
                  (d)  If transporting in a motor vehicle, the container with the resealed bottle of wine shall be placed in a locked glove compartment, a locked trunk, or the area behind the last upright seat of a motor vehicle that is not equipped with a trunk.

                  (a)  Licensed establishments may elect to allow patrons to bring in their own bottles ("brown bagging") of wine. Brown bagging of malt beverages and distilled spirits shall be prohibited. All regulations as to prohibited sales as defined in section 6-102 of this chapter shall apply to this section. Brown bagging shall not be permitted at any eating establishment which is not licensed for on-premises consumption sales. No alcoholic beverage of any kind may be sold or served on any licensed premises during any period of suspension and brown bagging is likewise prohibited during any suspension. Brown bagging is prohibited at any restaurant or other commercial establishment or business not licensed for on-premises alcohol sales under this chapter. 
                  (b)  Licensed establishments may charge a "corking" fee for bottles brought in by patrons. Fee amounts shall be the discretion of the establishment.

                  Sworn officers of the sheriff's office, or staff of the fire department, or the building official, or employees of the director's office shall have the authority to inspect establishments licensed under the alcoholic beverages ordinances of the county during the hours in which the premises are open for business.

                  Sec. 6-206 - Types of entertainment, attire and conduct prohibited. 
                  (a)  Preamble and purpose. 
                  (1)  Based upon the experiences of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Seattle and Renton, Washington; New York, New York; Los Angeles, California; and Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida, which experiences the board of commissioners believe are relevant to the problems faced by the county and based upon the evidence and testimony of the citizens and experts who have appeared before such bodies, as well as the testimony of citizens and experts received by this commission, the board of commissioners takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. 
                  (2)  Moreover, it is the finding of the board of commissioners that public nudity and semi-nudity, under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances relating to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "erotic entertainment," begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhoods, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior herein described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude or semi-nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare and is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments that serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity or semi-nudity. 
                  (b)  Prohibited activities. Any establishment licensed under the provisions of this chapter is prohibited from permitting or engaging in the following activities: 
                  (1)  The employment or use of any person in any capacity in the sale or service of alcoholic beverages while such person is unclothed or in such attire, costume or clothing as to expose to view any portion of the female breast below the top of the areola or any portion of the pubic hair, anus, cleft of the buttocks, vulva or genitals; 
                  (2)  Live entertainment that provides or features nude or semi-nude or erotic dancing or the performance of obscene acts that simulate: 
                  a.  Sexual intercourse, masturbation, sodomy, bestiality, oral copulation, flagellation or any sexual acts that are prohibited by law; 
                  b.  The touching, caressing or fondling of the breast, buttock, anus or genitals; or 
                  c.  The display of the pubic hair, anus, vulva or genitals; 
                  (3)  The showing of any film, still pictures, electronic reproduction or other visual reproductions depicting any of the acts described in subsection (b)(2) of this section which are obscene under state law; or 
                  (4)  The holding, promotion or allowance of any contest, promotion, special night or any other activity where patrons of the licensed establishment are encouraged or allowed to engage in any of the above-prohibited conduct. 
                  (c)  Mainstream activity excluded. Notwithstanding the prohibitions in subsection (b) of this section, nothing in this article shall be or is intended to apply to theatrical or motion picture performance houses, museums, or to restaurants or places set apart for traditional naturism where the consumption or service of alcohol is not a primary purpose or the mainstream activity of such establishment. The phrase "places set apart for traditional naturism" means places provided or set apart for traditional naturism including nudist parks, clubs, and resorts affiliated with the American Association for Nude Recreation, the Naturists Society or other naturist organization, and has been in operation as a naturist facility for at least 24 months prior to application for a license.

                  (a)  No licensee or employee or agent of a licensee, in connection with the sale or other disposition of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises, shall: 
                  (1)  Offer or deliver any free alcoholic beverage to any person or group of persons; 
                  (2)  Deliver more than one alcoholic beverage to one person at a time; 
                  (3)  Sell, offer to sell, or deliver to any person or group of persons any alcoholic beverage at price less than the price regularly charged for such alcoholic beverage during the same calendar week, except at private functions not opened to the public; 
                  (4)  Sell, offer to sell, or deliver to any person or group of persons an unlimited number of alcoholic beverages during any set period of time for a fixed price, except at private functions not open to the public; 
                  (5)  Sell, offer to sell, or deliver alcoholic beverages to any person or group of persons on any one day at prices less than those charged the general public on that day, except at private functions not opened to the public;

Upon declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the Governor or the chair of the board of commissioners, the board of commissioners may temporarily suspend the enforcement of the ordinances of the county, or any portion thereof, where the emergency is of such nature that immediate action outside the code is required, such suspension is consistent with the protection of the public health, safety and welfare, and such suspension is not inconsistent with any federal or state statutes or regulations. 
                  (e)  Fees.

The temporary permit shall not exceed six months. In the case of a continuing hardship and in the discretion of the board of commissioners or its designee, the permit may be extended for a period of up to an additional six months if necessary to accomplish the purposes of this article.

Each day any such entity does business in the unincorporated areas of the county without complying with this article constitutes a separate offense. 
                  (b)  The cost of registration fees in a declared emergency or disaster is fixed at $50.00 per annum. Registration is nontransferable. The cost of the emergency building permit shall be equal to the cost for a building permit under existing regulations. The permit shall only be authorized for repairs. 
                  (c)  When registering, any person, partnership, corporation or other entity making application must, under oath, complete an application, providing the following information:

If an application is denied or a permit is suspended or revoked, the applicant or holder of the permit must be notified in writing, specifically stating any and all reasons why the action was taken. The purpose of these procedures is to state the minimum actions to be taken to fulfill the obligation of the health authority in assuring compliance with the regulations when the continued operation of a restaurant presents a substantial and imminent health hazard to the public or when a food service establishment is in flagrant or continuing violation of this article. Suspension is effective upon service of a written notice thereof, and food service must cease immediately. The notice must state the basis for the suspension and advise the permit holder of the right to a preliminary hearing on request within eight working hours. If requested, the preliminary hearing will be held by an experienced supervisory level employee of the health authority not directly involved in the suspension. The rules of evidence will not apply, but both the health authority and the permit holder may present witnesses, records and argument. The hearing official will be authorized immediately to rescind or modify the suspension or to continue the suspension with or without conditions. If the suspension is not rescinded, the permit holder will have the right on request to an evidentiary hearing. If a hearing is not requested, upon correction of all violations, owner may request an inspection to reinstate permit.

Should access be denied, an inspection warrant may be obtained as authorized in O.C.G.A. title 31, ch. 5, art. 2 (O.C.G.A. § 31-5-20 et seq.). 
                  (3)  Report of inspection. When the health authority makes an inspection of a food service establishment or operation, the findings shall be recorded on an inspection report form provided for this purpose. Upon the completion of the inspection, the evaluating official shall have management or its representative sign the inspection report form. Management's signature shall not necessarily indicate agreement with the findings noted on the inspection form. The most current inspection report shall be posted in public view.

                  (2)  If the franchise fees are not paid on or before the dates set forth herein, then Dawson County shall provide written notice to the franchise holder that such fees have not been paid and shall notify the cable service provider or video service provider that such entity shall have 15 days from the date that the franchise holder receives such notice to cure any such nonpayment. If the franchise fees are not remitted to Dawson County, postmarked on or before the expiration of the 15-day cure period, then the holder of the state franchise shall pay interest thereon at a rate of one percent per month. If the 15-day cure period expires on Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday, then the due date shall be the next business day. The franchise holder shall not be assessed interest on late payments if franchise payments are or have been submitted in error to a neighboring local governing authority.

For purposes of this subjection, an audit shall be defined as a comprehensive review of the records of the holder of a state franchise. Once any audited period of a state franchise holder has been the subject of a requested audit, such audited period of such state franchise holder shall not again be the subject of any audit. In the event of a dispute concerning the amount of the franchise fee due to the county under this Code section, an action may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction by the county seeking to recover an additional amount alleged to be due or by a state franchise holder seeking a refund of an alleged overpayment; provided, however, that any such action shall be brought within three years following the end of the quarter to which the disputed amount relates. Such time period may be extended by written agreement between the state issued franchise holder and such affected local governing authority. Each party shall bear the party's own costs incurred in connection with any such examination or dispute. In the event that the county files an action to recover alleged underpayments of franchise fees and a court of competent jurisdiction determines the cable service provider or video service provider has underpaid franchise fees due for any 12 month period by ten percent or more, the cable service provider or video service provider may be required to pay the county its reasonable costs associated with the audit along with any franchise fee underpayments; provided, however, late payments shall not apply. 
                  (2)  The financial records disclosed during an audit shall not be subject to public inspection. The statements made pursuant to this section and any records or information furnished or disclosed by a cable service provider or video service provider to the county pursuant to an audit shall be exempt from public inspection under O.C.G.A. § 50-18-70 et seq. 
                  (d)  Payments. The acceptance of any payment shall not be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim that Dawson County may have for further or additional sums payable as a franchise fee. Any amount overpaid by the holder of the state franchise shall be deducted from future franchise payments. 
                  (e)  Effective date. The effective date of the resolution from which this section is derived shall be January 2, 2008.

                  (Ord. of 11-19-2009, § 6.02) 
                  Sec. 30-241. - Application for license; issuance of license. 
                  (a)  Application. 
                  (1)  All persons 25 years of age or older desiring to obtain a license required under this division shall make written application to the board of commissioners through the planning and development department for such privilege, and shall supply such information as may be required by the county manager or designee. The application shall be sworn to by the applicant or agent thereof. 
                  (2)  All applicants shall furnish all data, information and records requested of them. Failure to furnish such data, information and records within 30 days from the date of such request shall automatically serve to dismiss the application, with prejudice. An applicant, by filing an application, agrees to produce for oral interrogation any persons who are considered as being important in the ascertainment of the facts relative to such license, as may be requested by the board of commissioners or its duly authorized representative. The failure to produce such persons within 30 days after being requested to do so shall result in the automatic dismissal of such application.

                  (2)  Where the applicant is a corporation, the majority stockholder must meet the residence requirements set out in subsection (c)(1) of this section, and the license shall be issued to the corporation and the majority stockholder.

The term "conviction," as used in this section, shall include an adjudication of guilt or plea of guilty, plea of nolo contendere or forfeiture of a bond when charged with a crime. Where the violation is for a misdemeanor, forfeiture of bond or violation of a county ordinance, or where there is a plea of nolo contendere, the county manager or designee may, after investigation, waive the violation as a disqualification.

No license shall be issued by the county manager or designee to any person until such time as a signed and notarized background check consent form has been filed by such person with the marshal's office or such department's designee and upon payment of a fee that shall be established by the board of commissioners and a search of the criminal record of the applicant is completed. The background check consent form shall include, but not be limited, to the name, date of birth, address, citizenship status and prior arrest record of the person, though the fact of an arrest record shall be used for investigative purposes only and shall give rise to no presumption or inference of guilt. Due to the inclusion of arrest information, these applications shall be regarded as confidential and shall not be produced for public inspection without a court order. Applications must be accompanied by a valid government issued I.D. card. (for example a drivers license or state issued I.D. card). The marshal shall report his recommendations to the board of commissioners. A copy of such report shall be filed with the planning and development department. 
                  (f)  Time limit for obtaining license. All licenses must be obtained and fees paid not later than two weeks from the date of the approval of the application by the board of commissioners, and, if not so obtained, the approval granted by the board of commissioners shall be void.

Failure to open the licensed establishment within the three-month period shall serve as an automatic forfeiture and cancellation of the unused license, and no refund of license fees shall be made to the license holder. 
                  (b)  Any holder of a license who shall begin the operation of the business as authorized in the license, but who shall for a period of three consecutive months thereafter cease to operate the business as authorized in the license, shall, upon completion of the three-month period, automatically forfeit his license, and the license shall, by virtue of such failure to operate, be canceled without the necessity for any further action of the county manager or designee.

Any such license may be transferred only to another person doing the same business at the same place as the person to whom the license was originally issued. When permission for transfer has been granted, the original licensee or transferee shall cause the license to be delivered to the county manager or designee who shall record such transfer, and the transferee shall pay a fee therefore as a condition precedent to engaging in operations under the license. The fee for such transfer shall be kept on file as part of the schedule of fees in the planning and development department.

                  ARTICLE IV. - ADULT BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENTS 

                  Sec. 30-394. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The intent and purpose of this article is to regulate the place of operation of adult business establishments as defined herein. This article is intended to be a carefully tailored regulation to minimize the adverse impacts caused by the undesirable secondary effects of adult entertainment and adult media establishments. The Board of Commissioners of Dawson County finds that restricting adult business establishments and imposing development standards can legitimately regulate such establishments by delineating zones where adult business establishments are most compatible with other uses and the surrounding neighborhood. The board also finds that requiring minimum distances to be maintained between adult business establishment uses and other uses will afford the most protection to residential uses. The board does not intend to deny any person's right to free speech, conduct, or expression protected by the United States Constitution or the Georgia Constitution. The board intends to adopt a content neutral measure to address the undesirable secondary effects of adult business establishments.

                  Sec. 42-61. - Application for permit. 
                  (a)  Application for a permit to construct or alter a driveway or curb cut occurring on or abutting a county road right-of-way shall be made to the public works director of the county under the following circumstances: 
                  (1)  When such driveway(s) or curb cut(s) are incidental to the development of a new single-family residential structure or the development of previously undeveloped property, the driveway permit shall constitute a part of the building permit application package. 
                  (2)  When such driveway or curb cut construction occurs for a commercial, multi-family residential, office, institutional or industrial facility. 
                  (3)  When such driveway or curb cut construction constitutes a separate action apart from any other construction on the same site. 
                  (4)  When property abutting a county road right-of-way changes from one use to another and driveways and/or curb cuts have previously been extended across or to a county road right-of-way, or when the type of use or the volume of use of an existing and/or previously approved driveway is substantially changed, application for review shall be submitted and a driveway permit issued by the public works director. 
                  (b)  The occupancy permit of any building may be withheld until such driveway improvements have been approved. 
                  (Ord. of 4-15-2004, § IV) 
                  Sec. 42-62. - Issuance or denial of permit; appeals. 
                  Upon reviewing an application for a residential, commercial, multi-family, office, institutional or industrial driveway permit in any of the aforementioned circumstances, the public works director shall take one of the following courses of action: 
                  (1)  Issue the permit if the standards correspond with the requirements as outlined in the regulations. 
                  (2)  Deny the permit application. 
                  (3)  If the driveway permit is denied by the public works director, the applicant can appeal the public works director's decision to the board of commissioners, who shall hear testimony from the applicant. The board of commissioners may either approve or deny the application. 
                  (Ord. of 4-15-2004, § V) 
                  Sec. 42-63. - General design standards. 
                  The location, design and construction of the driveway shall be in accordance with the following standards. These standards are in no case to be modified unless specifically authorized by the public works director: 
                  (1)  A driveway shall be located and restricted as to width as necessary driveway and its appurtenances are contained within the frontage along the highway of the property served. At public highway intersections a driveway shall not provide direct ingress or egress to or from the public highway intersection area and shall not encroach on or occupy areas of the roadway or right-of-way deemed necessary for effective traffic control or for highway signs or signals. This shall not be construed to pertain to property outside the right-of-way, except common access. A driveway shall be so located and constructed that vehicles approaching or using it will have adequate sight distance in both directions along the highway. 
                  (2)  The number of driveways permitted serving a single property frontage shall be a maximum of two unless more are deemed necessary by the public works director for reasonable service to the property without undue impairment of safety, convenience, and utility of the highway. 
                  (3)  If the property has frontage on more than one street, and a driveway permit is requested, then one driveway will be allowed on each frontage or two on a single frontage if one is not requested for the other frontage(s). This may be reduced or increased as necessary by the public works director to reduce potential adverse effects which may result. If it is determined it would cause a nuisance to the surrounding area, or a traffic hazard, or unduly congest traffic, then the permit may be denied. 
                  (4)  The island area on the right-of-way between successive driveways or adjoining a driveway and between the highway shoulder and right-of-way line shall remain unimproved for vehicular travel or parking. Such areas shall be considered as restricted and may be filled in or graded down only as hereinafter provided in subsection (10) of this section. 
                  (5)  The surface of the driveway connecting with rural type highway sections shall slope down and away from the highway shoulder a sufficient amount and distance to preclude ordinary surface water drainage from the driveway area flooding onto the highway roadbed. 
                  (6)  The driveway shall not obstruct or impair drainage in side ditches or roadside areas. Driveway culverts, where necessary, shall be adequate for surface water drainage along the roadway and in no case less than the equivalent of 15-inch diameter pipe 25 feet in length. Installation shall be as per figure 8 in appendix A of this article. This requirement may be increased as necessary by the public works director. The distance between culverts under successive driveways shall be not less than ten feet except as such restricted area is permitted to be filled in under the provisions of subsection (10) of this section. 
                  (7)  Driveways connecting to "L" back curb and gutter must be constructed by removing the curb and gutter and pouring a valley gutter. When curb and gutter is removed for constructing a driveway, the new connections shall be of equivalent acceptable material and curb returns shall be provided or restored in a neat, workmanlike manner. The driveway or valley gutter surface shall connect with the highway pavement and sidewalks, if any, in a neat workmanlike manner. In no case shall the driveway construction impair the flow of water in the gutter. Figure 7, appendix A depicts the proper details for constructing a valley gutter. 
                  (8)  Driveways connecting to rolled curb and gutter may be constructed by either pouring the driveway directly up to the back of the curb or by removing the curb and gutter and pouring a valley gutter. When curb and gutter is removed for constructing a driveway, the new connections shall be of equivalent acceptable material and curb returns shall be provided or restored in a neat, workmanlike manner. The driveway or valley gutter surface shall connect with the highway pavement and sidewalks, if any, in a neat workmanlike manner. In no case shall the driveway construction impair the flow of water in the gutter. figure 7, appendix A depicts the proper details for constructing a valley gutter. 
                  (9)  Any activities that impair the flow of water in a curb and gutter is prohibited. These prohibited activities include, but are not limited to: The filling in of curb and gutter with concrete or asphalt, or the removal of curb and gutter without provided an acceptable valley gutter as described in subsections (7) and (8) of this section. 
                  (10)  The restricted area between successive driveways may be filled in or graded down only when the following requirements are fully complied with: 
                  a.  The filling or grading down shall be to grades approved by the public works director; and, except where drainage is by means of curb and gutter, water drainage of the area shall be directed away from the highway roadbed in a suitable manner. 
                  b.  Culvert extension under the restricted area shall be of like size and equivalent acceptable material of the driveway culvert, and intermediate manholes adequate for clean-out purposes may be required where the total culvert length exceeds 100 feet. 
                  c.  Where no side ditch separates the restricted area from the roadbed, permanent provision may be required to separate the areas from the highway roadbed, to prevent its use for driveway or parking purposes, by construction of a border, curb or other deterrent as deemed adequate by the public works director. 
                  (Ord. of 4-15-2004, § VI) 
                  Sec. 42-64. - Specific design standards. 
                  (a)  The following specific design standards shall apply to driveways requiring permits as set forth in these regulations. The items are driveway width, angle of entry and exit, return radius of curb, surfacing for driveway use, distance to side property lines, island areas, intersection clearance, parking and storage areas and driveway grade. The public works director shall have the authority to increase these requirements if in his/her opinion such action is necessary for the protection of traffic. The public works director may also modify these requirements if justifiable on the basis of site conditions. 
                  (b)  Driveway widths. Measured parallel to the roadway, driveway widths shall be as follows: 

                   
                  (c)  Angle of entry and exit. Driveway angles shall be as follows: 
                  (1)  Residential, 60 to 90 degrees, or per public works director; 
                  (2)  Apartments, 70 to 90 degrees for two-way driveways or 45 to 90 degrees for one-way streets; 
                  (3)  Commercial, 70 to 90 degrees for two-way driveways or 45 to 90 degrees for one-way on divided roadway or 60 to 90 degrees for one-way ramp on nondivided roadway; 
                  (4)  Industrial, 90 degrees, or as close as practicable, for two-way, or 45 degrees, one-way access on one-way street; 
                  (5)  Rural, land access only, 60 to 90 degrees. 
                  (d)  Return radius of curb. Return radius of curbs shall be as follows: 

                   
                  (e)  Surfacing of frontage for driveway use. No approval for a curb cut will be given where it is apparent that the intent is not to provide access but to provide parking only. A driveway approach must provide access to something definite on private property such as a parking area considerably greater in extent than the width of the driveway, or provide access to a driveway, or to a door at least eight feet wide intended for the entrance of vehicles, etc. (door standard not applicable for residential driveways). 
                  (f)  Distance to side property lines. 
                  (1)  Subsection (f)(1)a or b of this section shall apply, whichever is more restrictive. 
                  a.  The area within five feet of a frontage boundary line shall be a restricted area on which no driveway may be developed on public right-of-way (E). See figures 1, 2, 3 and 4 appendix A. 
                  b.  A minimum of 1½ feet of pavement edge or curb shall be left undisturbed adjacent to each frontage boundary line to serve as an island area. This distance shall be measured between the FB line and the point of tangency of the driveway radius and the edge of the pavement measured along the edge of the pavement. 
                  (2)  These requirements may be waived when a single driveway is approved to serve two adjacent lots. 
                  (g)  Island areas. 
                  (1)  Minimum island dimensions. 
                  a.  Distance between double driveways (D), ten feet minimum at narrowest point; 
                  b.  Minimum island depth, four feet where parking abuts street right-of-way line. 
                  (2)  Treatment of island or buffer area. In the development of private property and the construction of driveways thereto, it may be necessary to regrade the buffer area by cutting or filling. Such work shall be done in a manner to insure adequate sight distance for traffic operations, proper drainage, suitable slopes for maintenance operations, and good appearance. The buffer area outside the driveways shall be treated to prevent use by vehicles. This may be accomplished by grading, or use of curbs, rails, low shrubs, etc., in a manner which will not impair clear sight across the area. 
                  (3)  Visibility clearance. No landscaping, fences, terraces, or other natural or artificial features adjacent to any street shall be of a nature impairing visibility from or of approaching vehicular traffic where such visibility is important to safety, nor shall such features in any way create potential hazards to pedestrians. In particular, at vehicular entrances and exits, no off-street parking, landscaping, or other material impediment to visibility between the height of three feet and ten feet, measured from the roadway level, shall be permitted within triangular areas defined by lines connecting points described as follows: 
                  a.  Nonresidential use. Beginning at a point where the midline of the entrance or exit intersects the public right-of-way, thence to a point of 35 feet along the right-of-way in the direction of approaching traffic, thence to a point of 25 feet toward the interior of the lot along the midline of the entrance or exit, and thence to a point of beginning. (See figure 5A of appendix A.) 
                  b.  Multi-family residential use. Beginning at a point where the midline of the entrance or exit intersects the public right-of-way, thence to a point of ten feet along the right-of-way in the direction of approaching traffic, thence to a point of ten feet toward the interior of the lot along the midline of the entrance or exit, and thence to the point of beginning. (See figure 5B of appendix A.) 
                  (h)  Intersection clearance. 
                  (1)  The length, width and shape of corner island areas will vary for different locations. The angle of intersection, angle of driveways, width of the right-of-way on both approaches, channelization radii, and other conditions will influence the location of driveways at intersections. The location and angle of an approach in relation to the highway intersection shall be such that a vehicle leaving the service facility may be merged in the lane of traffic moving in the desired direction before crossing the intersection, and that a vehicle entering the facility from the intersection may do so in an orderly and safe manner with a minimum of interference to through traffic. 
                  (2)  The following conditions may be applicable in most instances: 
                  a.  No driveway shall be allowed to encroach upon pavement edge radii. 
                  b.  The following minimum distances from the intersection right-of-way line (C) (see figures 3 and 4, appendix A) shall apply where there is no conflict with the foregoing conditions: 
                  1.  Residential street, five feet; 
                  2.  Minor collector street, 20 feet; 
                  3.  Major collector, 35 feet; 
                  4.  Minor arterial, 50 feet; 
                  5.  Major arterial, 65 feet; 
                  6.  Interstate highways, 100 feet. 
                  The public works director shall have the authority to increase these distances if in his opinion such action is necessary for the protection of traffic. The public works director may also modify these requirements if justifiable on the basis of site conditions. 
                  (i)  Parking and storage areas. 
                  (1)  Each roadside business establishment, when providing off-street parking or storage space, shall provide such parking or storage space off the right-of-way to prevent the storage of vehicles on the driveway or the backing up of traffic on the travel way. This is particularly needed for businesses where a number of vehicles will be leaving and entering at the same time. 
                  (2)  Particular attention will be paid to drive-in facilities such as banks, minute car washes, drive-in restaurants, drive-in bill paying facilities, and other service facilities where motorists are served while in their vehicles, to insure that queues of vehicles will not extend out onto the public streets. 
                  Sec. 42-65. - Driveway grade. 
                  (a)  Residential driveways. The maximum grade which shall be permitted is 15 percent within the county right-of-way. 
                  (b)  Apartment, commercial and industrial driveways. The maximum grade which shall be permitted is eight percent. 
                  (c)  Grades within the right-of-way shall be controlled by existing shoulder slope or existing and future sidewalk elevations. 
                  (d)  When driveways are intended for special use vehicles, the underside clearance and/or break over angle of the subject vehicle shall dictate the maximum driveway grade. 
                  (Ord. of 4-15-2004, § VIA) 
                  Sec. 42-66. - Common access driveways; general provisions.

                  Sec. 42-152. - [Mailbox installation.] 
                  A mailbox installation that conforms to the following criteria shall be considered acceptable, unless the installation interferes with the safety of the traveling public or the function, maintenance, or operation of the Dawson County roadway. A mailbox installation that does not conform to the provisions of this article is considered an unauthorized encroachment. 
                  (a)  No mailbox shall be permitted if access is obtained from the lanes of a roadway with more than two lanes of travel or if access is otherwise prohibited by law or regulation. Mailboxes 
                  shall be located on the right hand side of the roadway in the direction of the delivery route. The bottom of the box shall be set at an elevation established by the U.S. Postal Service (between three and one-half and four feet above the roadway surface). On curbed roads, the roadside face of the mailbox shall be set back from the face of curb at a distance between 12 and 18 inches. On roadways without curbs or all-weather shoulders and that carry low-traffic volumes (residential subdivisions) operating at low speeds (25 miles-per-hour or less), the roadside face of a mailbox shall be offset four feet behind the edge of pavement. If a mailbox is located on a Dawson County roadway where posted speed limits exceed 30 miles-per-hour, then the roadside face of a mailbox shall be offset a minimum of six feet behind the edge of the pavement. If a mailbox is located at a driveway or lane entrance, it shall be placed on the far side of the driveway in the direction of the delivery route. If a mailbox is located at an intersecting road, it shall be located a minimum of 100 feet beyond the center of the intersecting road in the direction of the delivery route. 
                  (b)  Mailboxes shall be made of light sheet metal or plastic construction conforming to the requirements of the U.S. Postal Service. Newspaper delivery boxes shall be made of light sheet metal or plastic construction of minimum dimensions suitable for holding a newspaper. Lightweight newspaper boxes may be mounted below and to one side of the mailbox support. A mailbox support structure shall consist of a single 4″ × 4″ square or four and one-half-inch diameter round wooden post, metal post with a structural strength no greater than a two-inch diameter standard strength steel pipe, injection molded plastic, vinyl or like material that will bend, sheer, fracture or otherwise give way at the ground when struck by a vehicle, and be embedded no more than 24 inches into the ground. A metal post shall not be fitted with a base anchor plate, but may have attached an anti-twist device that extends no more than ten inches below the ground surface. A mailbox support shall not be cemented in the ground. The post-to-box attachment should be of sufficient strength to prevent the box from separating from the post top if the installation is struck by a vehicle. If multiple (cluster) mailboxes are installed at a single delivery location, then the minimum spacing between the centers of support posts shall be three-fourths the height of the posts above the ground line. Mailboxes shall not be encased in a steel, rock, concrete or brick structures, nor be placed upon or attached to any other ornamental structures including pieces or parts of farm equipment, tractors, vehicles, wagons, trailers, implements, milk cans, buckets, drums, wheels or similar materials likely to result in vehicle damage, passenger injury or death if struck by a vehicle. 
                  (c)  Any mailbox that had been established before the adoption of this article shall be deemed grandfathered unless a mailbox creates a safety hazard to the traveling public and shall then be considered an unauthorized encroachment and shall be removed by the responsible person, firm, business or corporation upon written notification by the Dawson County Public Works Department. At the discretion of the Dawson County Public Works Department, based on an assessment of the hazard to the public, the person, firm, business or corporation shall be granted not less than 24 hours or more than 15 days to remove an unacceptable mailbox. After the specified removal period has expired, the unacceptable mailbox shall be removed by the Dawson County Public Works Department at the expense of the responsible person, firm, business or corporation.

System improvement costs include the construction, contract price, surveying, and engineering fees, related land acquisition costs including land purchases, court awards and costs, attorneys' fees and expert witness fees; and expenses incurred for qualified staff or any qualified engineer, planner, architect, landscape architect, or financial consultant for preparing or updating the capital improvements element; and administrative costs of up to three percent of the total of all other system improvement costs. Projected interest charges and other finance costs may be included if the impact fees are to be used for the payment of principal and interest on bonds, notes, or other financial obligations issued to finance system improvements. System improvement costs do not include routine and periodic maintenance expenditures, personnel training and other operating costs. 
                  System improvements means capital improvements that are public facilities and are designed to provide service to more than one project or to the community at large, in contrast to "project" improvements. 
                  Unit of development means the standard governmental measure of land development activity for a specific type of land use upon which the rate of demand for public service and facilities is based, such as a dwelling unit, square foot of nonresidential floor area, motel room, etc. 
                  Unused or excess impact fee means any individual impact fee payment from which no amount of money or only a portion thereof has been encumbered or expended according to the requirements of this article.

                  (b)  Construction not subject to impact fees. The following projects and construction activities do not constitute "development" as defined in this article, and are therefore not subject to the imposition of impact fees: 
                  (1)  Rebuilding no more than the same number of units of development as defined in this article that were removed by demolition or destroyed by fire or other catastrophe on the same lot or property. 
                  (2)  Remodeling or repairing a structure that does not result in an increase in the number of units of development.

                  (6)  Constructing an addition to or expansion of a residential housing unit that does not increase the number of housing units. 
                  (7)  Adding uses that are typically accessory to residential uses and intended for the personal use of the residents, such as a deck or patio, satellite antenna, pet enclosure, or private recreational facilities such as a swimming pool. 
                  (c)  Grandfathered projects. 
                  (1)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, any project for which a valid building permit had been issued prior to July 20, 2006, shall not be subject to development impact fees so long as the project remains in its construction and land use as authorized according to the terms of such building permit. 
                  (2)  Any building for which a valid and compete application for a building permit has been received prior to the effective date of an amendment to this article may proceed without payment of additional impact fees otherwise imposed by this article, provided that: 
                  a.  All fees and development impact fees in effect prior to the effective date of this article shall be or have been paid in full; and 
                  b.  Said construction shall be commenced, pursued, and completed within the time established by the building permit or within 180 days, whichever is later. 
                  (d)  Method of calculation. 
                  (1)  Any development impact fee imposed pursuant to this article shall not exceed a project's proportionate share of the cost of system improvements, shall be calculated on the basis of the establishment of service areas, and shall be calculated on the basis of levels of service for public facilities that are the same for existing development as for new growth and development, as established in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan. 
                  (2)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this article, the calculation of impact fees shall be net of credits for the present value of ad valorem taxes or other revenues as established in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan and which: 
                  a.  Are reasonably expected to be generated by new growth and development; and 
                  b.  Are reasonably expected on the basis of historical funding patterns to be made available to pay for system improvements of the same category and in the same service area for which an impact fee is imposed. 
                  (3)  The method of calculating impact fees for public facilities under this article shall be maintained for public inspection as a part of the official records of the county, and may be amended from time to time by official act. 
                  (4)  In addition to the cost of new or expanded system improvements needed to be built to serve new development, the cost basis of a development impact fee may also include the proportionate cost of existing system improvements to the extent that such public facilities have excess service capacity and new development will be served by such facilities as established in the capital improvements element. 
                  (5)  Development impact fees shall be based on actual system improvement costs or reasonable estimates of such costs as set forth in the capital improvements element.

                  Sec. 101-61. - Fee assessment and payment. 
                  (a)  Fee schedule. 
                  (1)  Payment of a development impact fee pursuant to the fee schedule attached hereto and incorporated herein as attachment A shall constitute full and complete payment of the project's proportionate share of system improvements as individually levied by the county and shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this article. 
                  (2)  When a land development activity for which an application for a building permit has been made includes two or more buildings, structures, or other land uses in any combination, including two or more uses within a building or structure, the total development impact fee shall be the sum of the fees for each and every building, structure, or use, including each and every use within a building or structure. 
                  (3)  In the event that an applicant contends that the land use category of the proposed project is not shown on the fee schedule or fits within a different category, then: 
                  a.  The administrator in his or her sole discretion shall make a determination as to the appropriate land use designation and the appropriate development impact fee. 
                  b.  In making such determination, the administrator may require such additional information from the applicant as necessary to form a logical fee determination relative to the impact fees shown on the adopted fee schedule. 
                  c.  If a land use designation is not in a category contained in this article, then an appropriate new category may be added by the administrator and an appropriate fee established under the county's current impact fee methodology, subject to annual confirmation by the board of commissioners. 
                  d.  Appeals from the decision of the administrator shall be made to the board of commissioners in accordance with the administrative appeals section of this article.

                  (2)  All development impact fees shall be collected no earlier than the time of issuance of a building permit, and no later than as a prerequisite to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the building. 
                  (3)  For projects not involving issuance of a building permit, all development impact fees shall be collected at the time of approval of the development permit, or such other authorization to commence construction or to commence use of a property. 
                  (4)  If the final use of a building cannot be determined at the time of the initial building permit, the administrator shall have the authority to assess a development impact fee based on the most likely use of the building and shall adjust the fee in accordance with the actual use prior to issuance of an interior finishes permit or approval of a certificate of occupancy. An adjustment may result in a refund to the fee payor or payment of the marginal increase of the adjusted fee over the amount already paid. 
                  (5)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, any future change in demand for public facilities in excess of the average demand anticipated at the time of issuance of the building permit shall be assessed such additional fee as would otherwise have been due. Future changes in demand may result from a change in the land use category of the occupant of the building or property, the expansion of a building, or the expansion of a land use on a property that results in an increase in the units of development (as defined herein), or the subsequent discovery of facts unknown or misrepresented at the time of issuance of the building permit. 
                  (c)  Individual assessment determinations. Individual assessments of development impact fees may be established as follows: 
                  (1)  At their option, an applicant for development approval may petition the administrator for an individual assessment determination of development impact fees due for their project in lieu of the fee established on the fee schedule attached hereto and incorporated herein as attachment A. 
                  (2)  In the event that an applicant elects an individual assessment, the applicant shall submit an individual assessment study. Each individual assessment study shall: 
                  a.  Be based on relevant and credible information from an accepted standard source of engineering or planning data, or 
                  b.  Be based on actual, relevant, and credible studies or surveys of facility demand conducted in Dawson County or its region, carried out by qualified engineers or planners pursuant to an accepted methodology; and 
                  c.  Provide any other written specifications as may be reasonably required by the administrator to substantiate the individual assessment determination. 
                  (3)  The administrator in his or her sole discretion shall determine whether the content of an individual assessment study satisfies the requirements of this article. A negative determination by the administrator may be appealed to the board of commissioners in accordance with the administrative appeals section of this article. 
                  (4)  Any fee approved as an individual assessment determination shall have standing for 180 days following the date of approval. Payment of such an approved individual assessment determination shall constitute full and complete payment of the project's proportionate share of system improvement as individually levied by the county, and shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this article. 
                  (d)  Fee certification. Upon application to the administrator, a developer may receive a certification of the development impact fee schedule attached hereto and incorporated herein as attachment A, or a certified fee for a particular project, as applicable. Such certified schedule or fee shall establish the development impact fee due for a period of 180 days from the date of certification even if new or revised rate schedules are adopted in the interim.

                  Sec. 101-62. - Exemptions. 
                  Dawson County recognizes that certain office, retail trade, lodging, service, and industrial development projects provide extraordinary benefit in support of the economic advancement of the county's citizens over and above the access to jobs, goods and services that such uses offer in general. To encourage such development projects, the board of commissioners may consider granting a reduction in the impact fee for such a development project upon the determination and relative to the extent that the business or project represents extraordinary economic development and employment growth of public benefit to Dawson County in accordance with adopted exemption criteria. It is also recognized that the cost of system improvements otherwise foregone through exemption of any impact fee must be funded through revenue sources other than impact fees.

                  (b)  Expenditures; restrictions. 
                  (1)  Expenditures from the impact fee accounts shall be made only for the system improvements in the public facility category for which the development impact fee was assessed and collected.

                  a.  Such expenditures for a specific project may be based on the amount of the actual cost of the project, but; 
                  b.  Such expenditures may not exceed the percentage of impact fee eligibility established for such project in the capital improvements element. 
                  c.  Expenditures for projects not listed in the capital improvements element may be made only after they have been included in the capital improvements element by amendment adopted by the board of commissioners.

                  b.  Any portion of an impact fee collected as a requirement for expenditures made by the county for system improvements intended to be funded by such impact fee; and 
                  c.  Any portion of the impact fee collected for administration of the impact fee program and such additional amount assessed for repayment of the cost of preparing the capital improvements element (CIE) or required annual CIE update reports to the state. 
                  (c)  Annual report. 
                  (1)  The administrator shall prepare an annual report to the board of commissioners based on the preceding annual audit describing the amount of any development impact fees collected, encumbered, and used during the preceding fiscal year by public facility category. 
                  (2)  Such annual report shall be prepared following guidelines of the Georgia Department of Community Affairs (DCA) and submitted to the Georgia Mountains Regional Commission in conjunction with the annual update of the community work program of the comprehensive plan.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this article, any credit due under this section shall not constitute a liability of the county, and shall accrue to the developer to the extent of impact fees assessed for new development for the same category of system improvements. 
                  c.  In no event shall credit be given for project improvements or for system improvements not included for impact fee funding the most recently adopted capital improvements element.

                  a.  Credit shall be given for the present value of any construction of improvements, contribution or dedication of land, or payment of money by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest for system improvements of the same public facilities category for which a development impact fee is imposed, provided that: 
                  1.  The system improvement is included for impact fee funding in the most recently adopted capital improvements element; 
                  2.  The amount of the credit does not exceed the portion of the system improvement's cost that is eligible for impact fee funding as shown in the capital improvements element; and 
                  3.  The board of commissioners shall have explicitly approved said improvement, contribution, dedication, or payment and the value thereof prior to its construction dedication or transfer. 
                  b.  The credit allowed pursuant to this section shall not exceed the impact fee due for such system improvement unless a greater credit is authorized under a private agreement executed under the provisions of section 101-66. 
                  (3)  Guidelines for credit valuation. Credits under this section shall be valued using the following guidelines: 
                  a.  For the construction of any system improvements by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the county, the developer must present evidence satisfactory to the administrator of the original cost of the improvement, from which present value may be calculated. 
                  b.  For any contribution or dedication of land for system improvements by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the county, the original value of the land shall be the same as that attributed to the property by the validated tax appraisal at the time of dedication, from which present value may be calculated. 
                  c.  For any contribution of capital equipment that qualifies as a system improvement by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the county, the value shall be the original cost to the developer of the capital equipment or the cost that the county would normally pay for such equipment, whichever is less. 
                  d.  For any contribution of money for system improvements from a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest accepted by the county, the original value of the money shall be the same as that at the time of contribution from which present value may be calculated. 
                  e.  In making a present value calculation, the discount rate used shall be the net of the interest returned on a State of Georgia, AA rated or better municipal bond, less average annual inflation, or such other discount rate as the board of commissioners in its sole discretion may deem appropriate. 
                  (4)  Credits: application. 
                  a.  Credits shall be giver only upon written request of the developer to the administrator. A developer must present written evidence satisfactory to the administrator at or before the time of development impact fee assessment. 
                  b.  The administrator in his or her sole discretion shall review all claims for credits and make determinations regarding the allowance of any claimed credit, and the value of any allowed credit. 
                  c.  Any credit approved by the administrator shall be acknowledged in writing by the administrator and calculated at the time of impact fee assessment. 
                  d.  Credit denials by the administrator may be appealed to the board of commissioners in accordance with section 101-68, administrative appeals. 
                  (5)  Credits; abandoned building permits. In the event that an impact fee is paid but the building permit is abandoned, credit shall be given for the impact fee paid against future impact fees for the same parcel of land upon submission of adequate evidence to the administrator that an impact fee was received by the county, the amount paid, and that the building permit was abandoned.

                  (1)  Upon the request of a fee payor regarding a property on which a development impact fee has been paid, the development impact fee shall be refunded if: 
                  a.  Capacity is available in the public facilities for which the fee was collected but service is permanently denied; or 
                  b.  The development impact fee has not been encumbered or construction has not been commenced within six years after the date the fee was collected. 
                  (2)  In determining whether development impact fees have been encumbered, development impact fees shall be considered encumbered on a first-in first-out (FIFO) basis. 
                  (b)  Notice of entitlement to a refund. When the right to a refund exists due to a failure to encumber the development impact fees, the administrator shall provide written notice of entitlement to a refund to the fee payor who paid the development impact fee at the address shown on the application for development approval or to a successor in interest who has given adequate notice to the administrator of a legal transfer or assignment of the right to entitlement to a refund and who has provided a mailing address. Such notice shall also be published in a newspaper of general circulation in Dawson County within 30 days after the expiration of the six-year period after the date that the development impact fee was collected, and shall contain a heading notice of entitlement to development impact fee refund. No refund shall be made for a period of 30 days from the date of said publication.

                  (3)  In no event shall a fee payor be entitled to a refund for impact fees assessed and paid to recover the cost of excess capacity in existing system improvements, for any portion of an impact fee collected as a repayment for expenditures made by the county, for system improvements intended to be funded by such impact fee, or for that portion of the fee payment that was assessed for administration of the impact fee ordinance or for recovery of the cost of preparation of the capital improvements element.

In varying any provision of the construction codes, the affirmative votes of the majority present shall be required.

                  (c)  Powers and meetings. The construction board of adjustments and appeals shall have the power, as further defined in subsection (d) of this section, to hear the appeals of decisions and interpretations of the building official and consider variances of the construction codes. Meetings shall be held on an as needed basis with a minimum of two meetings each year to occur once in January and once in July unless such board has otherwise met to handle election of officers and other regular business. All meetings shall be open to the public and the board shall set the time of each meeting. 
                  (d)  Appeals. 
                  (1)  Decision of the building official. The owner of a building, structure or service system, or his duly authorized agent, may appeal a decision of the building official to the construction board of adjustment and appeals whenever any one of the following conditions are claimed to exist: 
                  a.  The building official rejected or refused to approve the mode or manner of construction proposed to be followed or materials to be used in the installation or alteration of a building, structure or service system.

                  d.  The true intent and meaning of the construction codes or any of the regulations therein have been misconstrued or incorrectly interpreted. 
                  (2)  Variances. 
                  a.  The construction board of adjustments and appeals, when so appealed to and after a hearing, may vary the application of any provision of the construction codes to any particular case when, in its opinion, the enforcement thereof would do manifest injustice and would be contrary to the spirit and purpose of this or the construction codes or public interest, and also finds all of the following: 
                  1.  That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the building, structure or service system involved and which are not applicable to others. 
                  2.  That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the action or inaction of the applicant. 
                  3.  That granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by the construction codes to other buildings, structures or service system. 
                  4.  That the variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the building, structure or service system. 
                  5.  That the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of the construction codes and will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  b.  Condition of variances. In granting the variance, the board may prescribe a reasonable time limit within which the action for which the variance is required shall be commenced or completed or both. In addition, the board may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with the construction codes. Violation of the conditions of a variance shall be deemed a violation of the construction codes. 
                  (3)  Notice of appeal. Notice of appeal shall be in writing and filed within 30 calendar days after the building official renders the decision. Appeals shall be in a form acceptable to the building official. 
                  (4)  Unsafe or dangerous buildings or service systems. In the case of a building, structure, or service system, which is unsafe, unsanitary or dangerous, the building official may, in his order, limit the time for such notice of appeals to a shorter period. 
                  (e)  Rules and regulations. The board shall establish rules and regulations for its own procedure not inconsistent with the provisions of these procedures. The board shall meet on call of the chairman. The board shall meet within 30 calendar days after notice of appeal has been received. 
                  (f)  Decisions. The construction board of adjustment and appeals shall, in every case, reach a decision without unreasonable or unnecessary delay. Each decision of the board shall also include the reasons for the decision. If a decision of the board reverses or modifies a refusal, order, or disallowance of the building official or varies the application of any provision of the construction codes, the building official shall immediately take action in accordance with such decision. Every decision shall be promptly filed in writing in the office of community development and shall be open to public inspection. A copy of the decision shall be sent by mail or otherwise to the applicant. Every decision of the board shall be final; subject however to such remedy as any aggrieved party might have at law or in equity.

The tree density standard shall be calculated by adding the following credits and dividing the total acreage of the project included within the limits of the permit application, but excluding any acreage included within a zoning buffer and any other land area excluded by this article. 
                  (1)  a.  Credit for existing trees proposed to be preserved on the site shall be calculated by multiplying the number of trees (by diameter) by the units assigned in appendix A, credit for existing trees, of this article. Credit shall be given for all trees preserved on a property having a diameter of three inches or more, except trees located in a zoning buffer. 
                  b.  Multi-trunked trees shall only be given credit by measuring the largest single trunk and not the cumulative total of the various trunks. Tree-form shrubs shall not be given credit for satisfying the required tree density standard. 
                  (2)  a.  Credit for new trees proposed to be replaced on the site shall be calculated by multiplying the number of trees (by diameter) by the units assigned in the appendix B, credit for replacement trees. Credit shall be given for all new trees replaced on a property (except for new trees less than one inch in diameter and new trees planted in a required zoning buffer). 
                  b.  Multi-trunked trees shall only be given credit by measuring the largest single trunk and not the cumulative total of the various trunks. Tree-form shrubs shall not be given credit for satisfying the required tree density standard. 
                  (3)  Additional credits shall be granted under the following circumstances: 
                  a.  A total tree density credit not to exceed two times the units shown in appendix A, credit for existing trees, shall be granted by the department for existing trees 12 inches in diameter or greater for trees to be preserved. 
                  b.  Existing trees to be preserved within a 100-year flood plain shall be granted a bonus credit of 50 percent of the units assigned in appendix A, credit for existing trees, unless the tree is located within a required zoning buffer. 
                  c.  Existing trees to be preserved that are significant or specimen trees will receive a density credit not to exceed two times the units shown in appendix A, credit for existing trees. 
                  (h)  Tree preservation requirements. The following guidelines and standards shall apply to trees proposed to be preserved for credit towards meeting the minimum required tree density standards on a tract of land. 
                  (1)  Tree protection areas. The root system within the dripline is generally considered to be the critical root zone. To protect these critical root zones, a tree protection area shall be established around each tree or group of trees to be retained. The tree protection area shall include no less than the total area the tree canopy as defined by the dripline of the tree or group of trees collectively. Layout of the project site utility and grading plans shall avoid disturbance of the tree protection area. Construction site activities such as parking, materials of storage, concrete washout, burnhole placement, etc., shall be arranged so as to prevent disturbance within the tree protection areas. 
                  (2)  Protective barriers. Protective tree fencing shall be installed between buffers. Tree protection areas are areas proposed to be cleared, graded, or otherwise disturbed on the site before any land development. All tree protection areas are recommended to be designated as such with "tree save area signs" posted in addition to the required protective fencing. All tree protection areas must be protected from soil sedimentation intrusion through the use of silt screens or other acceptable measures placed up-slope from the tree protection area. All protective tree fencing and all erosion control barriers shall be installed prior to, and maintained throughout, the land development and construction process and shall not be removed until final landscaping is installed. 
                  (3)  Encroachment. If encroachment into a tree protection area occurs which causes irreparable damage to the trees, the tree preservation and/or replacement plan shall be revised to compensate for the loss as per section 109-29. Under no circumstances shall the developer be relieved of responsibility for compliance with the provisions of this article, nor shall plan revision activities stop the department from instituting action for violation of this article. 
                  (i)  Tree replacement requirements. Replacement trees proposed to be planted for credit toward meeting the minimum required tree density standard on a property shall comply with the following requirement guidelines: 
                  (1)  The spacing of replacement trees must be compatible with spatial site limitations and with responsible consideration towards species size when mature. 
                  (2)  Trees selected for planting shall be a species listed on appendix C, canopy tree list and appendix D, understory tree list of this article. Standards for transplanting shall be in keeping with those established by the International Society of Arboriculture, as included in the "Tree and Shrub Transplanting Manual," latest edition, or similar publications. Refer to the American Association of Nurseryman publication "American Standard for Nursery Stock" (ANSI Z60, 1973) for plant material quality specifications. Refer to the "Manual of Woody Landscape Plants" (Michael Dirr, 1983, Castle Books) or similar publications for information on tree species site requirements. 
                  (3)  Trees selected for planting must be free from injury, pests, disease, nutritional disorders or root defects, and must be of good vigor so as to assure a reasonable expectation of survivability. 
                  (4)  Trees must be replaced with at least 50 percent overstory trees. 
                  (5)  Replacement trees shall not be more than one-third in number of one genus (e.g. oak, maples, etc.) unless approved by the county arborist or designee. 
                  (j)  Tree species list. Tree species lists are found in appendix C, canopy tree list, and appendix D, understory tree list, of this article. The director is authorized to administratively add or delete species to both lists with notice to be provided to the planning commission and board of commissioners at the next available meeting for ratification by consent. Except as specifically approved by the director as a modification, only the trees listed shall be given credit towards meeting the requirements of this article.

                  Sec. 109-56. - Minimum requirements for erosion and sedimentation control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES General Permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this ordinance shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of section 109-56(b) and (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this ordinance and the NPDES General Permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in section 109-56(b) and (c) of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities.

As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6 subsection (b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local Issuing Authority or by the Division or of any general permit for construction activities issued by the Division pursuant to subsection (f) of Code Section 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the Director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local Issuing Authority or by the Division or any general permit for construction activities issued by the Division pursuant to subsection (f) of Code Section 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsection (c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 (c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et. seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods as not feasible, provided, in any case that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 109-56(b)(2) of this article; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (20) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the Director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50 foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25 foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (17)  Construction site operators shall control waste at the construction site, such as discarded building materials, concrete truck washout, chemicals, litter, and sanitary waste. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et. seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in section 109-56(b) and (c) of this article. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this ordinance or the terms of the permit.

However, the property owner is the only party who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements . 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of Dawson County without first obtaining a permit from the Planning and Development Department of Dawson County to perform such activity. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to of the Dawson County Planning and Development Department and must include the applicant's erosion and sedimentation control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 109-57(c) of this article. Soil erosion and sedimentation control plans shall conform to the provisions of section 109-56(b) and (c) of this article. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's soil erosion and sedimentation control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan or that such a visit was not required in accordance with rules and regulations established by the board. 
                  (3)  Fees shall be charged in accordance with the Dawson County Planning and Development Fee Schedule. 
                  (4)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. 12-7-8 half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (5)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. A district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of a district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 109-56(c)(15) and (16) and bonding, if required as per section 109-57(b)(7), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (6)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this ordinance section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application.

If the applicant does not comply with this ordinance or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements . 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 109-56(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" is hereby incorporated by reference into this ordinance. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (3)  Maintenance of all soil erosion and sedimentation control practices, whether temporary or permanent, shall be at all times the responsibility of the property owner. 
                  (d)  Permits . 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later that 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion and sedimentation control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this ordinance, any variances required by section 109-56(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per section 109-57(b)(7) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in affect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this ordinance, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this ordinance. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. 12-7-7 (f) (1). 
                  (7)  No permit shall be issued unless the applicant provides a statement by the tax commissioner's office certifying that all ad valorem taxes levied against the property and due and owing have been paid.

                  (1)  The 100 foot buffer shall be measured horizontally from the uppermost part of the river bank, usually marked by a break in slope. Although not within the measured 100 foot wide buffer, the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river shall be treated by Dawson County in the same manner as the river corridor and shall be included within the River Corridor Protection Plan. 
                  (2)  Because streams channels move due to natural processes such as meandering, river bank erosion, and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time. For the purposes of these standards, the river corridor shall be considered to be fixed at its position at the beginning of each review period for the Dawson County Comprehensive Plan. Any shift in the location of the protected river after the start of the review period will require a revision of the boundaries of the river corridor at the time of the next review by the Department of Community Affairs. 
                  River corridor protection plan. That part of Dawson County Comprehensive Plan which deals with the river corridor protection requirements specified herein.

                  Significant recharge area. Those areas mapped by the department of natural resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology, soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contracts, geologic structure, the presence of karst, and potentiometric surfaces. Significant recharge areas for Dawson County are typified by those in the Piedmont and Blue Ridge, where rock have little primary porosity, with most groundwater being stored in overlying soils. The significant recharge areas are those with thicker soils. Filed mapping indicates that thick soils in the Piedmont and Blue Ridge are characterized by a density of two or more geologic contacts per four square miles (source: 1976 1:500,00 Geological Map of Georgia) and slopes lower than eight percent. 
                  Utility. Public or private water or sewer piping systems, water or sewer pumping stations, electric power lines, fuel pipelines, telephone lines, roads, driveways, bridges, river/lake access facilities, storm water systems and railroads or other utilities identified by Dawson County.

                  Wetland protection plan. All wetlands within Dawson County which are indicated on the Wetlands Protection District Overlay Map as "wetlands providing significant wildlife habitat and/or which may be subjected to extensive mitigation." 
                  Wetlands, freshwater. Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. (33 CFR 32.93). The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation. Freshwater wetlands do not include any areas defined as "coastal marshlands" by the State Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1980 (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-280 et seq.).

                  ARTICLE VI. - REGULATING STORM WATER MANAGEMENT 

                  Sec. 109-141. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  Purpose and intent . The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
                  (1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
                  (2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
                  (3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality;

The stormwater management system shall be designed to remove 80 percent of the average annual post-development total suspended solids (TSS) load as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
                  (1)  It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; 
                  (2)  Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and, 
                  (3)  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by Dawson County are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
                  (b)  Stream channel protection . Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches: 
                  (1)  Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer; 
                  (2)  24-hour extended detention storage of the 1-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event; 
                  (3)  Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control. 
                  (c)  Overbank flooding protection . Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the 1-year, 24-hour storm under section 109-144(b) is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the 2-year through the 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided. 
                  (d)  Extreme flooding protection . Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, 24 hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. 
                  (e)  Structural stormwater controls . All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from Dawson County before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, Dawson County may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. 
                  Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
                  (f)  Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures . The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under section 109-144(a). The applicant may, if approved by Dawson County, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
                  (g)  Drainage system guidelines . Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutter, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public right-of-ways. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff from more that one parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following requirements: 
                  (1)  Methods to calculate stormwater flows shall be in accordance with the stormwater design manual; 
                  (2)  All culverts, pipe systems and open channel flow systems shall be sized in accordance with the stormwater management plan using the methods included in the stormwater design manual; and, 
                  (3)  Design and construction of stormwater conveyance facilities shall be in accordance with the criteria and specifications found in the stormwater design manual. 
                  (h)  Dam design guidelines . Any land disturbing activity that involves a site which proposes a dam shall comply with the Georgia Safe Dams Act and Rules for Dam Safety as applicable.

               <p>                  ARTICLE I. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 

                  Sec. 113-1. - Authorization. 
                  Ga. Const. art. IX, § II and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Board of Commissioners of Dawson County, Georgia, does ordain this chapter. 
                  (Ord. of 9-4-2008, art. 1, § A) 
                  Sec. 113-2. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of Dawson County, Georgia, are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. of 9-4-2008, art. 1, § B) 
                  Sec. 113-3. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; and 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  Sec. 113-4. - Objectives. 
                  The objectives of this chapter are: 
                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  ARTICLE IV. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 113-77. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this chapter, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces; 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters; 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this chapter, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  Sec. 113-78. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 113-77(4), "elevated buildings." 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 113-59(7). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: 
                  1.  Individual lots or parcels; 
                  2.  In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions; 
                  3.  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or 
                  4.  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood; 
                  must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Reference section 113-77(6)) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections (3)a through c of this section. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 113-28, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection (4)a of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article.

                  Sec. 113-79. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 113-28, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 113-28, then the building official shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this article only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall apply. 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (Note: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 113-77(4), "elevated buildings." 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  The building official shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.

                  Areas of special flood hazard established in section 113-28, may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 113-77(4), "elevated buildings." 
                  The building official shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in section 113-58(1)c and (2). 
                  (3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.

                  Sec. 113-108. - Variances. 
                  (a)  The Dawson County Board of Commissioners shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the building official in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of commissioners may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Dawson County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the board of commissioners shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The building official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the board of commissioners may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

                  Existing construction any structure for which the "start of construction" commenced before October 27, 1997 [i.e., the effective date of the first floodplain management code or ordinance adopted by the community as a basis for that community's participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)]. 
                  Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before October 27, 1997 [i.e., the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community]. 
                  Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads. 
                  Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
                  (1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or

                  Floodplain means any land area susceptible to flooding. 
                  Flood proofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is: 
                  (1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the national register; 
                  (2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
                  (3)  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places and determined as eligible by states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
                  (4)  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places and determined as eligible by communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either: 
                  a.  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
                  b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this Code. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
                  Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of this chapter, the term is synonymous with national geodetic vertical datum (NGVD). 
                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means any structure (see definition) for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after October 27, 1997, and includes any subsequent improvements to the structure. [i.e., the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the community as a basis for community participation in the (NFIP)]. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after October 27, 1997. [i.e., the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community]. 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) as corrected in 1988 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle, which is: 
                  (1)  Built on a single chassis; 
                  (2)  400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
                  (3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
                  (4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: Accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the start of construction of the improvement. Note: The market value of the structure should be: 
                  (1)  The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or 
                  (2)  In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. 
                  This term includes structures, which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include: 
                  (1)  Those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project; or 
                  (2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  ARTICLE II. - 2000 GUIDELINES

                  DIVISION 2. - INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW 

                  Sec. 117-40. - About urban design. 
                  (a)  It is the intent of this corridor plan to provide detailed design guidelines for developments in the SR 400 corridor from the Forsyth County line to the Lumpkin County line. This plan is implemented by ordinance to be adopted by the board of commissioners. 
                  (b)  Urban design is a discipline that describes and evaluates the characteristics and interrelationships of all elements of the three-dimensional form of the urban environment. Urban designers use an interdisciplinary approach that combines architecture, landscape architecture, and urban planning. Urban designers interrelate and arrange various elements of the built environment—distance, materials, scales, views, building style, road alignments, vegetation and other items—to form an attractive built environment. In doing so, urban designers are concerned not only with people observing the built environment from fixed points with particular developments, but also with observers moving by and perceiving buildings from further distances. 
                  (c)  Careful attention to attractive and pedestrian-friendly urban design is in the economic interests of the county, its citizens, and business owners. Attractive and integrated urban design features tend to improve an area's image, raise overall property values, attract new businesses and residents, and improve the quality of life. Research and experience have shown that there is a positive return on investment for design features, for both government and property owners. For example, the money a community spends on landscaped roadway medians, sidewalks, and street trees is likely to be amply returned in the form of increased tax revenue resulting from the overall increase in property values that accompanies attractive and desirable urban areas. 
                  (d)  Design guidelines are a set of criteria, uniformly applied in the planning approval process, to evaluate the appropriateness of proposed changes to individual properties in a designated district. The ultimate goal of design guidelines is to direct physical and visual changes in the district to create an architecturally and physically cohesive area of specified character. Design guidelines are meant to create a strong identity for the area as a distinctive place to shop, visit, work, and live. Design guidelines are a means of bringing together the interests of individual property owners and the general public to achieve mutual benefits. 
                  (Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 1; Ord. of 8-3-2006, § 1(attachment); Ord. of 8-20-2009(3)) 
                  Sec. 117-41. - Purpose and intent. 
                  (a)  The subject area, the Georgia 400 corridor, contains multiple property owners with differing interests. Developers in the corridor have commissioned or will commission different architects, each with their own unique motivations and styles. As projects are designed and developed in the corridor, designers tend to focus on their own site as a self-contained unit. 
                  (b)  Left to its own workings, the real estate market has already shown signs that it will produce development that is dominated by single-function land uses, buildings that are not coordinated with adjacent buildings and isolated from other uses, and circulation systems that serve exclusively the automobile. The intersection of Georgia 400 and State Route 53 has already developed as the equivalent of a city center at a highway interchange—shopping centers, restaurants, hotels, and apartments—one where buildings do not fully relate to one another and where the only way to get around is by car. The Georgia 400/State Route 53 interchange development represents at least a partial example where urban design opportunities have been overlooked—a lost opportunity of sorts. 
                  (c)  Without guidance from the county, future developments in the Georgia 400 corridor will likely be self-contained, fragmented compartmentalized, without coherence and relationship with other developments. Without guidance, developers are unlikely to interrelate streets, buildings, human uses, and natural systems in a manner that results in a coordinated, pleasing, and sustainable built environment across property lines. Unless additional guidance is provided, the corridor will most likely witness additional development that results in an uncoordinated jumble of box stores, repetitive parking lot entrances, and blank building walls. 
                  (d)  The purpose of these guidelines is to help site planners and urban designers look beyond their individual buildings and single parcels of land to shape the physical features of their development in a manner consistent with preferred principles of community design. The guidelines seek to help unify what would otherwise become a disparate and irreconcilable collection of land uses and architectural traditions. 
                  (e)  In presenting these guidelines, however, it is not the county's intent to adopt an overall architectural theme for the corridor. The corridor is not envisioned to become one monotonous strip where all shopping centers look the same, or are designed to provide one big festival marketplace. No single checklist can define what is good and bad design. Rather, the county intends to provide general guidance while allowing site designers the flexibility to propose multiple ways of meeting the letter and spirit of the guidelines. Furthermore, it is not the intent of these guidelines to try and convert what is surely an auto-related corridor into purely pedestrian friendly developments. However, elements of human scale and reasonable accommodations for pedestrians are integral components of the guidelines. 
                  (Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 1.2; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3)) 
                  Sec. 117-42. - Georgia 400 corridor. 
                  The development and design guidelines contained in this document shall apply to the Georgia 400 overlay district shown on the following corridor boundary map. All parcels lying wholly or partially within the corridor boundary shall be subject to these guidelines. 


                  (Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 1.3; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3)) 
                  Sec. 117-43. - Existing conditions and vision for the corridor. 
                  (a)  The Dawson County, Georgia, 400 overlay zone addresses the area adjacent to Georgia 400. The southern part of the corridor is currently (Year 2000) undergoing intense development pressure. Since this area is the main gateway to Dawson County, the development within this zone will have an immediate impact on how residents and travelers view the community. While development is logically suited for this area, it must be done in a quality, well-planned manner. 
                  (b)  High quality, mixed use development of commercial, light industrial, office, and residential is highly encouraged in this area. The southern portion of the corridor should have visual and functional designs that will create a pleasing environment for people to shop, conduct business, and reside. The long-term maintenance of this corridor as a place of distinctive character is in the vital interests of Dawson County. 
                  (c)  The northern portion of the Georgia 400 corridor is still fairly rural in character. Development within this zone should attempt to retain a rural character through carefully planned site layout, landscaping, and architecture. Mixed use development of commercial, industrial, office, institutional, and residential that is compatible with the visual quality of this portion of the corridor is highly encouraged. Certain guidelines established herein apply only to the northern portion of the Georgia 400 corridor. 

                  GA 400 North, north of commercial center at intersection of SR 53 
                  (d)  The northern portion of the Georgia 400 corridor is still quite rural. The guidelines encourage the maintenance of a more rural landscape in the north portion of the corridor, through a buffer requirement along the right-of-way and a higher landscaped coverage ratio.

                  Subdivision I. - In General 

                  Secs. 117-75—117-91. - Reserved. 
                  Subdivision II. - Site Planning 

                  Sec. 117-92. - Relate design to site and surroundings. 
                  (a)  The site plan, building design and landscaping of new development should achieve high quality and appearance, which will enhance and be compatible with the character of the surrounding area. Exterior maintenance or alterations, whether structural, or cosmetic, or changes in material, to developments within this corridor which are in conflict with the requirements for new construction are specifically not permitted. 

                  (b)  Site planning and design of projects proposed adjacent to dissimilar land uses should carefully address the potential undesirable impacts on existing uses. These impacts may include traffic, parking, circulation and safety issues, light and glare, noise, odors, dust control and security concerns. When proposed adjacent to one or more dissimilar land uses, the development must mitigate impacts by carefully addressing the potential undesirable impacts on existing uses. 
                  (Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 2.1.1; Ord. of 8-3-2006, § 1(attachment); Ord. of 8-20-2009(3)) 
                  Sec. 117-93. - Evaluate, retain, and incorporate natural features. 
                  (a)  Evaluate the proposed development's compatibility with the existing environment to determine the limitations and capabilities of the site for development. Development should be limited to a level that does not exceed the capabilities and requirements of a healthy environment. 
                  (b)  Significant site features such as natural ground forms, large rock outcroppings; water and significant view corridors shall be identified and should be incorporated into development plans. 

                  (c)  Riparian zones, stream corridors, and wetlands should be protected for their wildlife habitat and other values. Development plans for these areas should treat these components as assets. The alteration or improvement of significant natural resource areas may be permitted so long as relevant regulations are followed, potential losses are mitigated, and best management practices are employed to minimize permanent damage. 
                  (d)  Preserve patches of high-quality habitat, as large and circular as possible, feathered at the edges, and connected by wildlife corridors. 
                  (e)  The design of outdoor spaces should recognize and incorporate views, solar angles, climate, and the nature of outdoor activities which could occur in conjunction with the project. 
                  (Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 2.1.2; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3)) 

                  Sec. 117-94. - Protect environmentally sensitive areas. 
                  (a)  Conserve and protect natural resources, including air quality, trees, natural vegetation, existing topography, streams, creeks, wetlands, watersheds, water quality, and wildlife habitat. 
                  (b)  Limit development in environmentally sensitive areas such as severe topography and areas with drainage problems. This guideline is considered particularly applicable in the northern portion of the Georgia 400 corridor. 
                  (c)  Major considerations concerning water quality should include: organic pollution from infiltration and surface runoff; erosion and sedimentation; water temperature elevation; nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous; and toxic materials. 
                  (d)  Flood plain storage should not be decreased from its present state. Utilize areas of flood plain for open space and recreational purpose, whenever possible. 
                  (e)  Restore and enhance environmental functions damaged by prior site activities. 
                  (f)  The director of planning and development may exempt development proposals on properties with one acre or less in area, or minor developments, from this requirement if through a site visit or other information presented the requirement for a site conditions analysis can be satisfied with other data and enforcing this requirement would be onerous given the development proposed. 
                  (Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 2.1.3; Ord. of 8-3-2006, § 1(attachment); Ord. of 8-20-2009(3)) 
                  Sec. 117-95. - Create public spaces and amenity areas. 
                  (a)  Development should include public plazas, courtyards, and similar amenities or public assembly areas that are visible from the street and accessible from the business or other use. Such amenities should be scaled appropriately to the size and location of the project. 
                  (b)  Outdoor spaces, which are particularly encouraged, include courtyards, patios, plazas, covered walkways (arcades and colonnades), passages, gardens, and trellised areas. 
                  Outdoor Spaces. Fountains, play equipment, and artwork add visual interest and functions to amenity areas.

                  Subdivision III. - Grading 

                  Sec. 117-119. - Site preparation, filling, and grading. 
                  (a)  Abrupt or unnatural-appearing grading design is not allowed. Grading on new project sites should blend with the contours of adjacent properties with minimum alteration of the natural topography necessary to accomplish the development. 

                  (b)  The area under the drip line of all existing trees to be retained should be fenced prior to construction with orange plastic tree fencing material. Grading under the drip line of trees to be retained on site is prohibited so as to prevent soil compaction and significant root damage. 
                  (c)  Proposed cut and fill slopes should be rounded off both horizontally and vertically. 
                  (d)  Balancing the cut and fill is highly encouraged. 
                  (e)  No fill, removal, or modification of a riparian area should be approved unless there is no reasonable and feasible alternative, as determined by the county. 
                  (f)  Preserve smooth flowing planes in the ground form; minimize steep slopes and avoid harsh, easily eroded banks. 

                  Graded site adjacent to Kroger Shopping Center   This site has been graded level for development. Trees that may have contributed to the character of the development have not been saved. Grading should retain certain features of the natural topography, where possible.

                  Sec. 117-120. - Drainage and erosion control. 
                  (a)  All onsite drainage shall be collected and conveyed to an approved storm drainage system. 
                  (b)  Consider minimizing runoff by clustering development on the least porous soils. Consider using infiltration devices. Evaluate and if appropriate install permeable pavements for overflow and employee parking areas where possible. 
                  (c)  Natural on-site drainage patterns should be used where practicable. Detain runoff with open, natural drainage systems where possible. 
                  (d)  Design man-made lakes and storm water ponds for maximum habitat value. 
                  (e)  Best erosion control practices should be followed.

                  (a)  Tall, smooth faced concrete retaining walls are prohibited—walls visible from the right-of-way shall be faced with brick, stone, or other architectural treatment in the southern part of the SR 400 corridor and shall be composed of wood or similar earthen material in the northern part of the SR 400 corridor. The height and length of retaining walls should be minimized and screened with appropriate landscaping. 
                  (b)  Terracing should be considered as an alternative to the use of tall or prominent retaining walls, particularly in highly visible areas on hillsides. 

                  Industrial Area, Dawson County   A highly visible, long, smooth, concrete retaining wall that should be finished with brick, stone, or other architectural finish, or otherwise screened from view from the public right-of-way.

                  Sec. 117-122. - Utilities. 
                  (a)  Any utility installation proposed should be carefully assessed to insure against physical and visual damage to the landscape. 
                  (b)  Utility easements should be coordinated and combined to minimize the number of additional easements and stream and road crossings needed. 
                  (c)  All individual utilities serving developments shall be installed underground. 
                  (d)  Utility easements shall be naturally landscaped or stabilized per BMPs.

                  (a)  Berms should be used to provide visual and acoustical separation from vehicle traffic and incompatible land uses. The height and slope of a berm should vary to provide for visual interest and a more natural effect. 
                  (b)  When used for screening, berms can be combined with a fence or planting. Berms should be constructed of good quality soil (for planting) on top of landfill, separated by an impervious layer of clay. Berms can be used for other purposes, besides screening, too, like recreational seating.

                  (a)  All likely pedestrian routes should be identified in the design phase and provided for in the design process. These include linkages to individual buildings, neighboring properties, and access ways along public roads. Identifying pedestrian routes in advance will eliminate poor selection of landscape areas that become damaged due to pedestrian "short cuts." 

                  (b)  All site facilities and amenities shall be accessible to people with disabilities in accordance with the applicable federal and state codes. 
                  (c)  Pedestrian circulation should take precedence over vehicular circulation. 
                  (d)  Where pedestrian circulation crosses vehicular routes, a change in grade, materials, textures or colors should be provided to emphasize the conflict point and improve its visibility and safety. Brick pavers and other special paving materials and overhead features are encouraged to distinguish pedestrian walkway surfaces and areas.

                  (a)  The entire parcel, rather than simply a particular project, should be considered in formulating and approving access plans. 
                  (b)  A public frontage road shall be required parallel to Georgia 400. 
                  (c)  Parcels should not be subdivided such that they each require individual access to a state highway. If the parcel has frontage on a secondary or frontage road, access points shall occur there and not on a highway. 
                  (d)  The number of driveways shall be minimized, consistent with appropriate principles of highway and road access management and traffic engineering. Curb cuts (driveway accesses) will generally be restricted in number to one entrance and exit drive per development, if no other access is available. 
                  (e)  Inter-parcel site access should be provided to adjacent properties. 
                  (f)  Shared driveways between two parcels, at the property line, may be required. 
                  (g)  New driveways should be sited away from or immediately opposite street intersections. 
                  (h)  Provide adequate driveway length. Driveways should be long enough to allow adequate space for vehicles pulling off the road and stacking to enter the road. 
                  (i)  The width of curb cuts shall be minimized, but shall always meet the requirements of emergency service vehicles. A wider curb cut may be required on a higher speed highway. 
                  (j)  All elements of the site design shall accommodate access requirements of emergency vehicles and services. 
                  (k)  All access points and curb cuts shall meet minimum rules and regulations for driveway and encroachment control of the Georgia Department of Transportation, the Dawson County Engineer, and the specifications provided in these guidelines.

                  • This driveway entrance to Dawson 400 shopping center has a narrow but landscaped center median to separate traffic flows (recommended). 
                  • Note that it stops shorter than it should—although a median break may be needed to cross between the outlots shown in this photo, the median should have been extended another 150-200 feet to add landscaping, reduce impervious surface, and provide better access control. 
                  • The McDonalds uses low-lying groundcover at the entrance (acceptable). 
                  • To the right side of the photo, the shrubs are growing to a height that may impair visibility (though that is a minor consideration in this case of one way traffic). 
                  • Ideally, a pedestrian crossing would be striped on the pavement to alert drivers to the possibility of pedestrians crossing the driveway.

                  (c)  The driveway entry "throat" of large shopping center parking areas shall provide at least 40 feet of clear zone before a turning movement occurs to provide sufficient queuing room for cars entering off the street. 
                  (d)  The visual impact and presence of vehicles should be minimized, preferably by siting parking areas to the rear or side of the property rather than along the principal street frontage, or if siting options are limited, screening parking areas with vegetation and berms from views exterior to the site. 
                  (e)  Where a parking area fronts directly on a public street, a continuous opaque screen should be provided. Said screen should be a minimum height of two feet.

                  Sec. 117-206. - Generally. 

                  (a)  Landscaped areas should be maximized within the viewshed of the highway and major streets. 
                  (b)  All landscaping shall be continually maintained in a healthy and weed-free condition. 
                  (c)  Tree and shrub planting should be grouped together to create strong accent points within the site plan unless circumstances dictate otherwise. 
                  (d)  All plant materials should be sized so that the landscaping has an attractive appearance at the time of installation and a mature appearance within three years of planting. 
                  (e)  Landscaping of the site upon completion of the development shall be consistent, in terms of plant location, species, and size, with the landscape plan for the development as approved by the planning and zoning director. 
                  (f)  In certain prominent public areas, trees larger than the minimum may be required to create a strong design element. 
                  (g)  All proposed shrubs except accent, color or ground cover planting should be a minimum of three gallon size. Shrubs and ground cover plants should be spaced close enough together to ensure an attractive and mature planting effect. 
                  (h)  Landscaping should consider potential benefits of conserving energy in buildings. This can be done by recognizing the sun exposure on the site and providing appropriate tree species in advantageous locations: deciduous trees on the southern exposure, coniferous and broadleaf evergreen trees along the eastern and western exposures, and evergreens along the northern exposure. 
                  (i)  Trees should be carefully selected and located where they will complement the building elevation and should not block all retail storefront signage from view. 
                  (j)  Tree species should be selected with root growth habits that will not cause damage to sidewalks, or such tree species should be sited away from such hardscape areas. 
                  (k)  Utility easements should be landscaped. 
                  (l)  Dense landscaping and/or architectural treatments should be provided to screen unattractive views and features such as storage areas, trash enclosures, transformers, generators, and other similar appurtenances. 
                  (m)  Standards for transplanting should be in keeping with those established in the International Society of Arboriculture publication, "Tree and Shrub Transplanting Manual" or similar publication. Reference the American Association of Nurserymen publication "American Standard for Nursery Stock" (ANSI Z60, 1973) for plant material quality specifications. Reference the "Manual for Woody Landscape Plants" (Michael Dirr, 1983, Castle Books) or similar publication for information on tree species site requirements. 
                  (n)  Properties in the south portion of the Georgia 400 corridor shall require a minimum landscaped coverage ratio of 20 percent or as required by the Dawson County Tree Ordinance, whichever is greater. Properties in the north portion of the Georgia 400 corridor shall require a minimum landscaped coverage ratio of 30 percent or as required by the Dawson County Tree Ordinance, whichever is greater.

                  (a)  Buffers abutting residential districts. 
                  (1)  Where commercial, industrial, office, or institutional development abuts an existing residential zoning district along a side or rear property line, minimum building setbacks and buffers shall be established according to the following table: 

                   
                  (2)  Buffers required by this section shall be planted and maintained with sufficient density and vegetative material to effectively screen the adjacent residential use from the subject activities. Existing vegetation may be considered sufficient in meeting this requirement if the area is delineated on the landscape or development plan as a tree save area, is protected by the tree protection devices as prescribed by these guidelines, and provides sufficient screening. If an existing tree save area is proposed as a buffer but such area does not provide sufficient screening, said tree save area shall be supplemented with additional plantings until screening is achieved. 
                  This buffer requirement shall not apply to residential development that is developed as a part of a mixed-use development. If an existing residence lies within 100 feet of the property line adjoining the development, these buffer requirements shall apply unless written permission from the adjoining homeowners waiving these requirements is obtained. 
                  (b)  Buffers along Georgia 400 right-of-way in north portion of corridor. Where a commercial, industrial, office, or institutional development abuts Georgia 400 in the north portion of the corridor, there shall be a minimum 30-foot-wide buffer (natural undisturbed, planted, or both) according to standards provided by these guidelines. The buffer shall provide a visual screen for at least 60 percent of the length of the property frontage. 
                  (c)  Buffer standards. 

                   
                  The above specifications are intended to be illustrative and not intended to be applied rigidly. Furthermore, the number of rows of landscaping needed depends on the required width of the buffer. Vegetative material used in meeting the requirements for buffering should be of a height and mass that meets or exceeds the vegetative material suggested in the buffer standards table above.

                  This section applies to all properties fronting a public street, whether a county road, local public frontage road, or state highway, including Georgia 400; provided, however, that the buffer requirement in the north portion of the Georgia 400 corridor as specified in section 117-207(b) of these guidelines shall supersede the requirement for a right-of-way frontage-planting strip specified in this section. 
                  (1)  Provide a planting strip along the entire frontage of all road rights-of-way with a minimum depth from the street right-of-way line into the interior of the property as follows: 

                   
                  (2)  Trees equivalent to at least one three inch caliper tree for every 30 linear feet of length shall be saved or planted in such strips (trees may be planted in groups rather than in a single line). Any trees placed between the right-of-way line and the construction area (the buildings, accessory uses, and parking area) may be considered to be in the planting strips. (See Detail 1—Frontage Planting Strips)

                  Sec. 117-209. - Tree protection. 
                  (a)  When a choice is available as to which existing trees to save, emphasis should be given to the preservation of significant trees, even isolated individual trees, over the retention of other trees. Nonsignificant trees, however, should be saved in stands rather than as individual trees scattered over a site. 
                  (b)  All tree save areas must be delineated on the landscape plan. 

                  Chestatee State Bank, SR 53 east of Georgia 400 
                  • The developer of this site made a conscious effort to save two trees. Tree save areas should be identified for significant trees, and such areas should be integrated into the development (i.e., the parking lot and building are designed around the tree save area). 
                  • The tree save area on this site is another very good example of a recommended practice. 
                  (c)  All buffers with existing trees should be delineated on plans as tree save areas, unless the applicant clearly demonstrates the need for disturbance. 
                  (d)  Tree protection devices are necessary to eliminate activities detrimental to trees and are strongly recommended to guard against: soil compaction in the critical root zone resulting from heavy equipment, vehicular or excessive pedestrian traffic, or storage of equipment or materials; root disturbance due to cuts, fills or trenching; wounds to exposed roots, trunks or limbs by mechanical equipment; and other activities such as chemical storage, etc. Tree protection devices should be installed as shown on the landscape plan or otherwise completely surrounding the critical root zone of all trees to be preserved. The location and installation of all tree protection devices should be installed prior to or concurrent with the issuance of the construction permit for clearing and/or grading. 
                  (e)  Active tree protection should consist of chain link, orange laminated plastic, wooden post and rail fencing or other equivalent restraining material (See Details 2 and 3—Active Tree Protection And Active Tree Protection/CRZ). Passive protection should consist of heavy mil plastic flagging of a bright color or equivalent signage on a continuous, durable restraint sufficient to delineate the bounds of any tree protection or save areas. 
                  (f)  All tree protection devices should be installed prior to or concurrent with any clearing, grubbing or grading. Tree protection devices need to remain in functioning condition throughout all phases of development and may be subject to inspection by the county. 
                  (g)  All tree protection zones should be designated as such with "Tree Protection Area" signs posted visibly on all sides of the fenced-in area. These signs are intended to inform subcontractors of the tree protection process. Signs requesting subcontractor cooperation and compliance with the tree protection standards are recommended for site entrances (See Detail 4, Tree Protection Area Signage ).

                  Sec. 117-210. - Parking lot landscaping. 
                  (a)  Parking lots that face a street should be partially screened from the street by a low fence, wall, hedge, berm, or vegetated buffer. If a parking lot fronts an arterial or major collector street, and is of such a size that it dominates views from the fronting arterial/collector street and detracts from the overall streetscape and community appearance, then the parking lot should be screened or buffered with vegetation in its entirety from view along the fronting roadway(s) within the required right-of-way frontage planting strip (see section 117-208). 
                  (b)  Landscape islands containing at least one overstory tree or two understory trees planted in each landscape island, shall be provided within parking areas with ten or more spaces and located in such a manner so as to divide and break up the expanse of parking area. Where required, one landscape island shall be located at the end of each row of parking spaces in the interior of the parking lot. In addition, one parking lot landscape island shall also be provided for every 150 linear feet of parking spaces, whether at the periphery or in the interior of the parking lot. Each landscape island shall be of sufficient shape and size so that one overstory tree or two understory trees will fit within the island. No portion of an island shall be less than three feet in width. 
                  Each landscaped parking lot end island should have at least one overstory shade tree (shown), or two understory trees.

                  (d)  Curbing should be used at the edges of all planters and paving surfaces adjacent to vehicle circulation or parking areas. Vehicle overhang above or into landscape areas should be avoided unless wider or larger planting areas are provided to accommodate such instances. Landscaping should not be installed in areas of potential vehicle overhang.

                  (a)  In the north portion of the Georgia 400 corridor, street trees shall be installed in the public right-of-way of local streets for all development within nonresidential districts, subject to the approval of the county engineer. 
                  (b)  Unless unusual circumstances prevail, all street trees or parking lot trees should be a minimum 15-gallon size. Street trees should normally be overstory, nonornamental, with a minimum three-inch caliper planted at 75-foot intervals. Sugar maple is the preferred street tree. In the south portion of the Georgia 400 corridor, street tree planting should strive to achieve the look of a manicured landscape by planting; toward this end, street trees may be grouped rather than spaced at regular intervals. 
                  (c)  In lieu of street trees in the south portion of the Georgia 400 corridor, a right-of-way planting strip as required by these regulations should contain landscaping with a minimum caliper of three inches planted thirty feet on center.

                  (e)  Street tree placement should include consideration for vehicle line of sight, entrance and exit curb cuts, street light and traffic control devices, and other site specific conditions. Street trees should be planted in a manner so that when they reach maturity they will not conflict with the visibility of signs. 
                  (f)  Street trees should be pruned from grade to a minimum height of seven feet, six inches to allow visibility of buildings and sufficient vertical clearance.

                  (a)  Water-intensive landscaping, such as turf grass, should be concentrated in areas of high visibility and use. The combined square footage of turf grass and decorative water (e.g. fountains, ponds, etc.) should be minimized to reduce water use and evapotranspiration. 
                  (b)  Plant materials should be chosen which grow well in the localized climate and the given soil conditions without requiring excessive irrigation. 
                  (c)  A plan for an automatic irrigation system should be provided as appropriate to insure that all plants receive adequate water for healthy growth. Irrigation systems should be provided for all planted areas that are under roof overhangs.

                  Sec. 117-233. - Generally. 
                  (a)  Architectural design should be compatible with the developing character of the neighboring area. Design compatibility includes complementary building style, form, size, color, materials, and detailing. 
                  (b)  The relationship of a building to its site, the public right-of-way and adjacent buildings is one of the most important components of successful urban design. The appearance of a building with respect to the street and other surroundings should be considered. If the building is much different in elevation from adjacent buildings and improvements, it will look out of place. 
                  (c)  The designer should consider each of the following contexts as part of the design process: 
                  (1)  Size (the relationship of the project to its site). 
                  (2)  Scale (the relationship of the building to those around it). 
                  (3)  Massing (the relationship of the building's various parts to each other). 
                  (4)  Fenestration (the placement of windows and doors). 
                  (5)  Rhythm (the relationship of fenestration, recesses and projections). 
                  (6)  Setback (in relation to setback of immediate surroundings). 
                  (7)  Materials (their compatibility with the historic district). 
                  (8)  Context (the overall relationship of the project to its surroundings). 
                  (Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 6.1; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3)) 
                  Sec. 117-234. - Style. 
                  (a)  Diversity of architectural design should be encouraged. "Theme" or stylized architecture which is characteristic of a particular historic period or trend is not encouraged, unless the existing building or site is historically important to the district or necessary for architectural harmony. 
                  (b)  Multiple buildings on the same site should be designed to create a cohesive visual relationship between the buildings. 
                  (Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 6.2; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3)) 
                  Sec. 117-235. - Exterior materials. 
                  (a)  All sides of a building may impact on its surroundings and should be considered for treatment with an architectural finish of primary materials (i.e., brick and stone). As a general rule, front facades should be at least 80 percent brick and stone. Side facades should be at least fifty percent brick and stone. Rear facades do not have a minimum requirement for primary materials and can consist entirely of secondary materials (e.g., stucco). Tertiary materials (i.e., wood and metal) should be used for decorative elements and trim only. 
                  (b)  Exterior building materials on the primary structure should not include smooth-faced concrete block, tilt-up concrete panels, or prefabricated steel panels. 
                  (c)  The following types of building materials are highly prohibited: highly reflective, shiny, or mirror-like materials; mill-finish (noncolored) aluminum metal windows or door frames; exposed, unfinished foundation walls; exposed plywood or particle board; and unplastered, exposed concrete masonry blocks. 
                  (d)  All exterior facades of a structure located on an outparcel of a larger development should be considered primary facades and should employ architectural, site, and landscaping design elements which are integrated with and common to those used on the primary structure on the site. Common design elements should include colors and materials associated with the main structure or structures on the larger development. 
                  (e)  Buildings that are stylized in an attempt to use the building itself as advertising should generally be discouraged, particularly where the proposed architecture is the result of a "corporate" or franchise style. 
                  (f)  All vents, gutters, downspouts, flashing, electrical conduits, etc., should be painted to match the color of the adjacent surface, unless being used expressly as a trim or accent element. 
                  (g)  Soffits and other architectural elements visible to the public but not detailed on the plans should be finished in a material compatible with other exterior materials. 
                  (h)  Material or color changes generally should occur at a change of plane. Piecemeal embellishment and frequent changes in material should be avoided. 
                  (i)  Approved address numbers should be provided so that they are legible to the public from the street fronting the property.

                  • The rear side of the shopping center consists of a finished but monotonous wall. Although not visible to the general public unless they drive around to the rear of the shopping center, because of the lack of visual screening, adjacent residents will be able to view this wall. 
                  • A horizontal accent stripe (a four—six foot wide stripe of different color) could help to reduce the monotonous color and even give an appearance of breaking up the continuous nature of the building wall.

                  Sec. 117-236. - Colors. 
                  (a)  Facade colors should be low reflectance, subtle, neutral, or earth tone colors. High-intensity colors, metallic colors, black, or fluorescent colors should not be used. Building trim and accent areas may feature brighter colors, including primary colors, provided that the width of the trim should not exceed four feet. 
                  (b)  Building colors should be carefully chosen so that each building complements that of its neighbors. Colors can be classified as the "base" color (used on the majority of the building surface), "trim" color (used on the window trim, fascia, balustrades, and posts), and "accent" color (used on signs, awnings, and doors). The base color should consist of more subdued earth tones or brick shades. Trim colors should have contrasting lighter or darker shade than the base color. If natural brick is used, it should not be painted.

                  Sec. 117-237. - Awnings and canopies. 
                  (a)  The use of awnings on buildings are recommend so as to provide much needed protection from sun, wind, and rain, and to improve aesthetics of the building exterior. 
                  (b)  Awnings are recommended to be constructed with a durable frame covered by a canvas material. Awnings that are backlit through translucent materials may be acceptable but are not particularly encouraged. Aluminum and other metal canopies are acceptable in most instances, particularly when integrated into shopping center designs. Flameproof vinyl, canvas or metal awnings and canopies may be used. 
                  (c)  Solid colors are preferred over striped awnings, but striping is permitted if colors compliment the character of the structure or group of buildings. 
                  (d)  Awnings are encouraged for first floor retail uses to provide architectural interest and to encourage pedestrian activity. Where awnings are used, they should be designed to coordinate with the design of the building and any other awnings along the same block face.

                  Sec. 117-238. - Parapets. 
                  Parapets should not be unbroken on any given side of a building for more than 100 feet. Parapets with greater distances should be articulated by indentations and modulations or by the additions of elements such as balustrades or other exterior members.

                   The rear side of this shopping center consists of a finished but monotonous wall. Trash receptacles are not enclosed. 
                  (b)  The walls of buildings for office, institutional, commercial, and industrial use shall not extend more than 200 linear feet parallel to a street unless the front facade of the building is designed in a way that breaks up the building face into discrete architectural elements, which can be accomplished through the following: 
                  (1)  Facade modulation: stepping back or extending forward a portion of the facade. 
                  (2)  Providing bay windows or repeating window patterns at regular intervals. 
                  (3)  Providing a porch, patio, deck, covered entry to portions of the facade at the ground level, or in the case of buildings containing two or more story, balconies. 
                  (4)  Changing the roofline by alternating dormers, or using stepped roofs, gables, or other roof elements. 
                  (5)  Changing materials with the change in building plane.

                  (a)  All walls or fences fifty feet in length or longer, and four feet in height or taller, should be designed to minimize visual monotony though changes in plane, height, material or material texture or significant landscape massing. 
                  (b)  Chain link fencing is discouraged. Use of special fencing design or materials should be discussed in cases where site security is paramount. If used, it should be vinyl coated (black or green colored vinyl encouraged). 
                  (c)  Wooden fences should be painted or stained in an appropriate fashion and should not normally exceed a height of six feet. 
                  (d)  The design of fences and walls should be compatible with the architecture of the main building(s) and should use similar materials.

                  (a)  Commercial buildings should be compatible in scale, mass, and form with adjacent structures and the pattern of the surrounding area. 
                  (b)  Efforts to coordinate the height of buildings and adjacent structures are encouraged. This is especially applicable where buildings are located very close to each other. It is often possible to adjust the height of a wall, cornice or parapet line to match that of an adjacent building. Similar design linkages such as window lines should be placed in a pattern that reflects the same elements on neighboring buildings. 
                  (c)  Long or continuous wall planes should be avoided, particularly in the pedestrian activity areas, where buildings should exhibit more detail and elements appropriate for close range pedestrian view. 
                  (d)  Outside of pedestrian retail districts, building surfaces over two stories high or fifty feet in length should be relieved with changes of wall plane that provide strong shadow or visual interest.

                  (a)  The urban design objective of pedestrian retail districts is to create a high quality, pedestrian scale, and walkable areas with a traditional downtown atmosphere. Site and building design should address pedestrian needs and develop creative approaches to improving pedestrian interest, access and enjoyment.

                  (b)  Frontage design and signage locations should be coordinated with streetscape landscaping and street trees. 
                  (c)  Building frontages should be active, with large nonreflective minimally tinted window openings at ground level. 

                  (d)  The ground level front elevation of the building, outdoor eating, and activity areas should be placed on or near the front property line to maintain the continuity of the street edge, or in alignment with adjacent property frontage. Outdoor seating and dining areas that face onto the street are encouraged. 
                  (e)  Street vendors are encouraged to add activity and interest to pedestrian areas. 

                  (f)  Pedestrian open spaces such as covered walkways, courtyards and plazas are encouraged, as well as the development of open and attractive passageways between buildings and blocks. 
                  (g)  Gaps created in the street wall by parking or other breaks in buildings should be minimized or eliminated. 
                  (h)  The sequence of continuous pedestrian activity should not be interrupted. Blank walls and other "dead" or dull spaces at the street level should be avoided. Visually interesting activities at the sidewalk edge should be maintained and/or established to engage pedestrian interest. 
                  (i)  When alley access is not possible, driveway openings along public streets should be minimized and should be located on the street with the least traffic volume. 
                  (j)  Large structures should be designed to reduce their perceived height and bulk by dividing the building mass into smaller-scale components. The ratio of building height to right-of-way width should not exceed 1:3.

                  Source: Oregon Transportation and Growth Management Program 1999b. 
                  (l)  All developed sites should provide at least one continuous, on-site intra-parcel walkway of at least five feet in width to connect sidewalks adjoining rights-of-way to the main entrance(s) of that property's building(s), in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). 
                  (m)  The rear of existing buildings should be enhanced, where appropriate, to improve public access from parking lots and service alleys.

                  Sec. 117-286. - Automobile sales, parts, and service establishments. 
                  (a)  The service area and/or service bays should be screened or sited so they are not visible from the street. 
                  (b)  Vehicles under repair shall be kept either inside a structure or in an area which is screened from views from the street. 
                  (c)  Service areas shall provide adequate queuing space that does not impede vehicle circulation through the site or result in vehicles stacking into the street. 
                  (d)  Perimeter fencing, security fencing, or gateways shall be constructed of attractive materials which are compatible with the design and materials used throughout the project. Razor wire or electric fencing should not be allowed and chain link fencing is strongly discouraged. 

                  Express Lube, Alpharetta Highway, Roswell 
                  Discouraged practice. Auto service facilities should not have their service bays facing street, and parking for all uses should be located to the side or rear of the building rather than in the front yard.

                  NAPA auto parts store on the south side of  SR 53 east of GA. 400 
                  The architecture fits the company's logo and design specifications, but the small awning adds very little articulation and interest to the building facade. The all-metal building should be broken up and treated with some different materials, such as a partial brick base. 

                  NAPA Auto Parts Store, Mansell Road, Alpharetta 
                  This NAPA store's building exterior has a more finished appearance (textured block as opposed to metal siding), the sign is monument style rather than erected on a pole, and the front yard is landscaped with shrubs and street trees.

                  Sec. 117-287. - Convenience stores. 
                  (a)  The on-site circulation pattern should include adequate driving space to maneuver vehicles around cars parked at the pumps, with special attention to the circulation of vehicles not involved in the purchase of fuel. 
                  (b)  The amount of unrelieved pavement or asphalt area on the site should be limited through the use of landscaping, contrasting colors and banding or pathways of alternate paver material. Extensive expanses of single color concrete pavement should be avoided. 
                  (c)  Building architecture should be designed to provide an attractive appearance which is compatible with the surrounding area. All architectural details should be related to an overall architectural theme. 
                  (d)  Separate structures (canopy, carwash, cashiers booth, etc.) on the site should have consistent architectural detail and design elements to provide a cohesive project site. If a car wash is incorporated into the project, it should be well integrated into the design. The car wash opening should be sited so that it is not directly visible as the primary view from the street into the project site. 

                  Exxon convenience store with gas pumps and car wash, Alpharetta Highway, Roswell 
                  Recommended practices for building character into a convenience stores. The canopy over the gas pumps has brick support columns, a pitched, shingled roof and architectural detailing at the top of the structure. The car wash, located in the right part of the picture, has a brick facade and a pitched, shingled roof. Note that the materials for the canopy and car wash match the primary building on the site (convenience store). The developers have further softened the car wash building with second story windows.

                  Sec. 117-288. - Commercial display lots. 
                  (a)  Where permitted, the outside storage or display of vehicles, equipment, and merchandise to be rented, leased, or sold, including manufactured home sales, should be visible along no more than 30 percent of the frontage of the property abutting the highway or major street, excluding approved driveway entrances and exits. Screening may be accomplished by a natural vegetative buffer, by a building, by an earthen berm, by a 100 percent opaque, solid wooden fence or wall, or combination of these screening methods. The use of low-lying landscaping that does not screen the display areas from view from the public right-of-way would not comply with this guideline. 
                  (b)  Outdoor sales for department stores shall be limited to no more than ten percent of the total building footprint of the site, and should be partially screened from view. 

                  Fleetwood Homes site on GA 400 North 
                  The view to this site, which displays and sells manufactured homes, needs to be mostly screened. Recommended practice is to screen approximately 70 percent of the frontage with landscaping, leaving a significant view corridor on part of the frontage. 
                  (Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 8.5; Ord. of 8-3-2006, § 1(attachment); Ord. of 8-20-2009(3)) 
                  Sec. 117-289. - Fast food restaurants. 
                  (a)  Franchise or corporate style architecture and/or highly contrasting color schemes are discouraged. If the restaurant will occupy a pad within a shopping center, the building should be designed to be consistent with the "theme" or design of the center. 
                  (b)  Where drive-through elements are appropriate, they should be architecturally integrated into the building. Drive-through elements should not be located on the street side of the building or else should be heavily screened from view. 
                  (c)  The site design should accommodate a logical and safe vehicle and pedestrian circulation pattern through the site. Circulation needs to allow for adequate length of queuing lines for drive-through elements which do not interfere with the on-site parking for patrons entering the restaurant, nor result in traffic queuing into the street. 
                  (d)  Free-standing restaurant buildings should be designed and detailed consistently on all sides, including the rear and side elevations. 
                  (e)  Outdoor seating areas, play equipment, and perimeter fencing should be of compatible and attractive design that is integrated with the main building architecture. 

                  Waffle House under construction on the south side of SR 53 east of Georgia 400 
                  The building facade is broken up with regard to color and is composed of attractive materials. However, a pitched roof would have helped this building avoid a look of "shoebox" architecture. It has now been completed with awnings. 

                  Arby's at Dawson Forest Rd. and GA 400 

                  Arby's, Alpharetta Highway, Roswell 
                  The shorter side of the building faces the street with all parking and the drive-through facility located in the side and rear yards. The front yard is landscaped with grass and shrubs (recommended practices). The neon banding is not allowed. 
                  (Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 8.6; Ord. of 8-3-2006, § 1(attachment); Ord. of 8-20-2009(3)) 
                  Sec. 117-290. - Shopping centers. 
                  (a)  A unified architectural design should be incorporated into each commercial center, including freestanding pad buildings. However, this should not discourage variations in the facades of multi-tenant facilities to enhance the perception of individual places of business. Any such variations should be achieved without creating an uncoordinated appearance or disrupting the harmony of architecture created for the entire development. 

                  (b)  Outdoor gathering areas and public eating areas are encouraged. 
                  (c)  On larger commercial sites, a portion of the total building area should be located at the street perimeter, preferably on a corner location. Such siting, together with substantial landscape treatment, reinforces and strengthens the streetscape and helps to screen off-street parking areas. 
                  (d)  Shopping cart storage areas should be incorporated into the building design to provide a visual screen of carts from the parking area. 
                  (e)  Recycling collection boxes should be relocated in remote parts of the site and screened. 

                  Kroger Shopping Center at GA 400 and SR 53 
                  The parking lot lacks landscape islands. Box type lighting is appropriate and not too tall. No landscape strip exists along the side lot line. Most shopping centers are designed with parking to meet peak demands that rarely occur. 

                  Kroger Shopping Center at GA 400 and SR 53 
                  A grass strip separates the convenience store from the main shopping center. From the human scale, the signs oriented to capture the interests of motorists on Ga. 400 are tall and large. Note the Taco Bell restaurant in the left of the picture has multiple franchise flags flying from the roof. Flags used for advertising purposes add unnecessary visual clutter to the landscape. Notice the painted parking end island in the foreground; this area should have been curbed and landscaped with a street tree and shrubs to soften the impervious environment. 

                  Shopping center northbound on GA. 400 north of SR 136 
                  Pitched roofs and use of brick in front building facades are recommended practices. However, architectural features lack harmony in the shopping center. Use of columns is appropriate. Note on the roof the metal protrusion that appears to have little if any practical function (it may be an extended fire wall) but unnecessarily introduces a distracting feature to the facade. 
                  (Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 8.7; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3)) 
                  Sec. 117-291. - Urban activity centers. 
                  (a)  Generally. 
                  (1)  An urban activity center is a mixed-use, pedestrian-oriented development that combines retail, service, civic, office, institutional and multi-family and other residential uses and links the uses together by a highly connected pattern of streets, sidewalks, and shared open spaces. Activity centers allow for more intense clustering of land uses within nodes of new development to prevent the "stripping" out the entire corridor. For more information on recommendations for land use mix and design, see the land use element of the comprehensive plan (2005 amendment). 

                  (2)  Activity centers must provide pedestrian access and vehicular and pedestrian interconnections between and among land uses within the development. Pedestrian facilities are expected to be included. Improved connections between key designation areas should be developed, such as between residential and commercial areas and connecting to parks and schools. 

                  (b)  On-street parking. Except on primary frontage roads that provide access through the development, on-street parking may and should be provided on local streets and private access drives, especially within storefront retail areas, to reduce the need for parking lots and act as a buffer between automobiles and pedestrians. 
                  (c)  Mix of uses. Mixed uses may be combined vertically within the same building or placed side by side on the same parcel, provided that they are in close proximity, planned as a unified and complementary whole, and functionally integrated to make use of shared vehicular and pedestrian access and parking areas. 
                  (d)  Street design. 
                  (1)  Streets, along with sidewalks and open spaces, should be designed as the main public spaces of activity centers. Activity centers should have a grid or modified grid of interconnected streets that disperse traffic and shall connect the activity center with surrounding development. 

                  (2)  Streets within the development should have a design speed of 25 mph. 
                  (e)  Height and mass. For activity centers, building heights should be greatest near the center of these developments and transition to lower heights outward toward the edge of the development. Buildings at the edge should be comparable in height and massing to the adjacent and nearby properties as well as the surrounding neighborhood. 

                  Decrease Height and Mass in the Focus Area 
                  (f)  Building placement. Buildings should be placed close to (with little if any setback from) streets internal to the development, or along public streets abutting the development area, as determined in the development review and approval process. The buildings should be generally placed so that the main entrance is oriented to the street sidewalk. 

                  (g)  Storefront retail areas. 
                  (1)  The ground level of multi-story buildings should contain retail or entertainment uses with direct entry from the street to provide pedestrian interest along sidewalks. Pedestrian interest can be enhanced with use of windows, entrances, and architectural details. Pedestrian signage, awnings, and ornamentation are encouraged. 
                  (2)  Storefront windows should be transparent. Mirrored glass, faux windows or display casements are strongly discouraged. 
                  (h)  Residential uses in activity centers. Some residences should be developed above the retail. A variety of housing types including single-family detached, town homes, multi-family units, and accessory dwellings should be created to provide diversity and a range of costs and types of housing in activity center developments. 

                  (i)  Pedestrian scale. 
                  (1)  Activity centers must be designed for the pedestrian as well as the automobile. The network of sidewalks, designated street crossings, and pathways shall be as complete as the one for automobiles and providing direct, convenient access. Sidewalks must be placed on both sides of streets within activity centers. 
                  (2)  Street trees shall be planted along local streets and frontage roads to provide a distinct separation and buffer between pedestrians and moving automobiles. 

                  (j)  Open spaces in activity centers. Activity centers shall provide useable open space in the form of urban spaces (plazas, greens, and pocket parks) and/or natural areas. Open spaces may include outdoor restaurant seating and playgrounds. Less formal open space uses such as walking or biking trails along natural streams, wetlands or other natural features should be used on the periphery of these developments. 
                  (k)  Civic and institutional uses. Sites for churches, schools, community or club buildings, and similar public or semi-public facilities are encouraged to be provided, where appropriate, within activity centers. Uses such as schools, churches, and other institutions where provided should be part of an integrated site design and located and designed to minimize negative impacts.

                  Sec. 117-292. - Business park development. 
                  (a)  Purpose. The purpose of these design guidelines is to ensure that new business parks are high quality developments that support job creation and economic expansion and at the same time respect the rural character and natural environmental features of the area. To accomplish these objectives, business parks should be developed in a campus-like setting consisting of attractive buildings, significant natural open space and formal landscaped areas. The appropriate uses for these business parks are suburban light manufacturing and assembly, scientific and research laboratories and corporate and general offices. 
                  (b)  Perimeter buffer. Visual buffers consisting of existing vegetation supplemented by plantings and berms should be located along the periphery of business parks in accordance with overall landscaping requirements. 
                  (c)  Outdoor storage and display. 
                  (1)  Outdoor storage of materials or products is discouraged. Storage trailers or containers shall be located in designated areas at the rear of properties and screened from view. No outdoor processes should be employed in the operation of any business in the business park. Any waste and recycling receptacles shall be located within an enclosed structure at the side or rear of the building. 
                  (2)  No outdoor display areas should be allowed except for seasonal display as specified in commercial display lots. Display areas should be located within screened areas, flex-space, or office buildings. 
                  (d)  Landscaping. A minimum of ten percent of each developed subdivided tract within the business park should be devoted to landscaping. Large canopy street trees should be planted at 60 to 100 foot intervals along internal circulation roads.

                  Industrial districts are typically laid out in a gridiron of large blocks 1,000 to 2,000 feet long and 400 to 1,000 feet deep. Road rights-of-way should be 80-100 feet for major roads and 60 feet for secondary roads. Curves and radii must be large enough to accommodate large trailer trucks.

                  Sec. 117-315. - Screening of industrial and storage yards. 
                  All areas devoted to the outside storage of vehicles, merchandise, and/or equipment not intended for display for public rent, lease, or sale, shall be screened from view from the right-of-way of the highway or county road along the entire property frontage, except in areas where access crossings have been approved. Screening may be accomplished by a natural vegetative buffer, by a building, by an earthen berm, by a 100 percent opaque, solid wooden fence or wall, or combination of these screening methods. The use of low-lying landscaping that does not screen the display areas from view from the public right-of-way shall not be deemed to comply with this requirement. Loading areas should be located to the rear of the building unless site design precludes a rear location, in which case loading shall be to the side of a building. Loading areas shall not be permitted within front yards. 

                  J and M Laboratories building 
                  The rear side of J and M Laboratories provides a visible view of the loading and storage area (discouraged). This view should be at least partially screened with landscaping and/or a fence/wall. 

                  J and M Laboratories building 
                  The J and M Laboratories building is attractive architecture with appropriate use of columns and vertical articulation (generally good practice for business and industrial parks). However, the building is large enough that the building walls should also be broken vertically with recesses or projections to interrupt the continuous plan of the facade. Notice the reflection of the trees in the windows—while the windows are attractive they should not be too reflective. 

                  Gainesville Welding and Maintenance,  Henry Grady Highway 
                  Chain link fencing with barbed wire top strands may be necessary for security purposes in light industrial zoning districts. If so, it should be coated with vinyl. The vehicle storage area is not screened (discouraged practice). Solid wooden fencing without barbed wire, with vegetated landscaping to soften the fencing, is a recommended practice. Inserting plastic or metal slats into the chain links for screening is not recommended because the inserts bend and break and are typically not very well maintained. The storage tank should be buried underground or at least screened. 
                  Loading areas should be located to the rear of the building unless site design precludes a rear location, in which case loading shall be to the side of a building. Loading areas shall not be permitted within front yards.

                  (a)  New multiple-family residential developments should respect the scale and character of the adjacent residential neighborhood through attention to views, building scale and orientation, proximity to adjacent uses, location of driveways, noise, lighting and landscape. 
                  (b)  Building facades should be articulated by using color, arrangement, or change in materials to emphasize the facade elements. The planes of the exterior walls may be varied in height, depth or direction. Long facades should be designed with sufficient building articulation and landscaping to avoid a monotonous or overpowering institutional appearance. 

                  (c)  Exterior site design and landscaping should provide functional recreational spaces and/or community site amenities. Exterior spaces should be designed to enhance the overall appearance and compatibility of such development by providing privacy, buffering and daylight, and to provide a pleasant transition to the street.

                  Sec. 117-335. - Planned residential communities. 
                  (a)  Planned residential communities may include golf-course master planned developments and exclusive (gated) neighborhoods. However, they may also provide a variety of dwelling types, including some combination of detached single-family (fee-simple or condominium), duplex, townhouse, multi-family dwellings and institutional (senior) living. Planned residential communities are therefore predominantly residential but not necessarily exclusively residential. 

                  (b)  Where predominantly single-family residential uses are proposed, the gross density should not exceed the recommendations of the comprehensive plan, land use element, as described for the land use classification in which the property is located, as shown on the county's future land use plan map.

                  Sec. 117-357. - Generally. 

                  (a)  Exterior lighting should be architecturally compatible with the building style, material and colors. 
                  (b)  Exterior lighting of the building and site should be designed so that light is not directed off the site and the light source is shielded from direct offsite viewing. All outdoor light fixtures shall be fully shielded or be designed or provided with light angle cut-offs, so as to eliminate uplighting, spill light, and glare. 
                  (c)  Excessive illumination of signage, building or site should be avoided. Roof lighting, down-lighting washing the building walls, and illuminated awnings are all strongly discouraged. 
                  (d)  Lighting limitations. The placement of street lights between buildings and the right-of-way of SR 400 in the northern portion of the SR 400 corridor are discouraged, except where they are necessary due to public safety concerns or in activity areas. It is intended that the northern part of the SR 400 corridor will remain a darker environment than the southern portion of the SR 400 corridor. 
                  (Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 11.1; Ord. of 8-3-2006, § 1(attachment); Ord. of 8-20-2009(3)) 
                  Sec. 117-358. - Mounting poles and height. 
                  (a)  Fixture mounting height should be appropriate for the project and the setting. Use of low, bollard-type fixtures, 3—4 feet in height, are encouraged as pedestrian area lighting. 

                  Pedestrian Lighting 
                  Source: Prouse 1992. 
                  (b)  The mounting height of fixtures in smaller parking lots or service areas should not exceed twenty feet, with lower mounting heights encouraged, particularly where adjacent to residential areas or other sensitive land uses. 
                  (c)  The placement of light poles within raised curb planter areas is encouraged, but conflicts with parking lot trees which can obscure the lighting should be avoided. 

                  Dawson 400 shopping center 
                  • The shoebox style lighting appears appropriate, although the light poles are of two different colors because the phased addition of the shopping center was not consistent with an earlier design theme. 
                  • The Ingles in the background is an excellent example of architectural articulation with gables and pitched roofs, unique second story window treatments, and effective awnings along the facade. Note also the strong variation in the roof line (all recommended architectural practices for shopping centers). 

                  Mattress King, Alpharetta Highway, Roswell 
                  Discouraged lighting practice. Flood lights installed at the roof line on the building are pointed toward the highway. At nightfall, motorists are likely to experience glare from these lights. 

                  (d)  Luminaries should be rugged for the application, adapted to the environment, and designed to give years of trouble-free service. Quality luminaries should be selected because, even though there is a higher initial cost, they will be paid back quickly in reduced maintenance costs and increased reliability. Pole mounted "lantern style" or post-top" luminaries are preferred. 
                  (e)  Cut-off fixtures required. 
                  (1)  All luminaries used for outdoor lighting shall be full cutoff luminaries which do not emit any direct light above a horizontal plane through the lowest direct-light-emitting part of the luminaire. 

                  Cut-Off Fixtures 
                  (2)  Security lighting unless activated by motion sensor devices, shall also meet this requirement. 

                  Security Lighting 
                  (3)  Wallpacks are not permitted unless fully shielded. 

                  Shielded Wallpacks Prohibited 

                  Unshielded Wallpacks Prohibited 

                  Shoebox-style (cut-off fixture) lighting is appropriate, although in this shopping center the light poles are of two different colors because the phased addition of the shopping center was not consistent with an earlier design theme. 

                  Discouraged lighting practice. Flood lights installed at the roof line on the building are pointed toward the highway. At nightfall, motorists are likely to experience glare from these lights.

                  (a)  Light fixtures that provide canopy overlighting should be recessed into the canopy. 
                  (b)  Yard lights shall be oriented downward; uplighting is not permitted. 
                  (c)  Roof top lighting is strongly discouraged. 
                  (d)  The use of excessive night-time security lighting is discouraged. Other security measures should instead be considered. 
                  (e)  The use of laser source light for outdoor advertising or entertainment is prohibited. 
                  (f)  High pressure sodium lighting is preferred over metal halide or other types of lighting for outdoor parking lots.

                  Sec. 117-360. - Architectural lighting. 
                  (a)  Well-designed and distinctive lighting of building facades is one of the best ways to attract attention and make a favorable impression with a minimal investment. Building facade lighting can help enhance the intrinsic charm, beauty, and utility of any given setting. Architectural lighting may include outlining, floodlighting, spotlighting, or any applicable combination of these techniques. 
                  (b)  The discrete lighting of a few key architectural features or details is preferred over uniform floodlighting of the entire building facade. Focal points can also be established through careful floodlighting of major buildings, with the lighting of secondary buildings keyed in turn to these focal points. 
                  (c)  Highly polished surfaces such as glass, marble, glazed tile, glazed brick, porcelain enamel, and various metals can reflect the image of the light source. Designers should avoid lighting these reflective surfaces directly. Glass buildings usually cannot be lighted for nighttime viewing.

                  Sec. 117-381. - Generally. 
                  (a)  Signage is regulated by a separate ordinance. See the Dawson County Sign Ordinance (chapter 129 of this Code). 
                  (b)  All signs should be architecturally integrated with their surroundings in terms of size, shape, color, texture, and lighting so that they are complementary to the overall design of the building and are not in visual competition with other signs in the area. 
                  (c)  All signs should complement their surroundings without competing with each other, and shall convey their message clearly and legibly. If illuminated, signs should not be overly bright for their surroundings. 
                  (Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 12.1; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3)) 
                  Sec. 117-382. - Sign placement. 
                  (a)  Signs should be proportionate to the dimensions of their location. 
                  (b)  Wall-mounted signs should be framed to create a clearly defined edge, provide shadow relief and a substantial appearance. 
                  (Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 12.2; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3)) 
                  Sec. 117-383. - Sign type. 
                  (a)  The use of roof signs is highly discouraged. 
                  (b)  Rims of neon or use of neon in signs are highly discouraged. 
                  (c)  Freestanding monument signs are appropriate for office, retail, and industrial uses. Freestanding signs should be a low height wherever site conditions allow for visibility. Monument sign materials should reflect the character of the use and the building(s) the sign identifies. 
                  (d)  Freestanding sign bases should be made of permanent, durable materials such as concrete or brick. Bases made of texture-coated sheet metal are discouraged. 
                  (e)  Pole-mounted freestanding signs are discouraged. 

                  (f)  Driveway directional signs should only be used for projects where circulation is complex and traffic must proceed through the site along a specific path for service. Where the layout of the parking lot and driveways are obvious and clearly apparent to the driver entering from the street, directional signage is not appropriate. When not appropriate or needed, such signage can visually clutter the site and are discouraged. 
                  (Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 12.3; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3)) 
                  Sec. 117-384. - Sign design and materials. 
                  (a)  Dark colored backgrounds on signs are generally encouraged. Stark white or extremely bright background colors such as bright red, orange or yellow are discouraged. 
                  (b)  Where the design of the sign results in a large field of illuminated background, the use of white or off-white as a background color should be avoided in favor of a more suitable color. 
                  (c)  Exposed supports or guy wires to stabilize signs are strongly discouraged. 
                  (d)  Flat sheet signs (such as plywood) should have a trimmed edge or frame to improve the finished appearance of the sign.

                  Sec. 117-385. - Sign lighting. 
                  (a)  External spot or flood lighting, if needed, shall be arranged so that the light source is screened from direct view by passersby, and so that the light is directed against the sign and does not shine into adjacent property or blind motorists and pedestrians. 
                  (b)  Illumination of individual letter signs by shining light upon them is discouraged for both skyline signs and signs placed high on building walls.

                  Sec. 117-386. - Sign programs. 
                  Sign programs that show how signs will complement the style, color and materials of the building are encouraged. 
                  (Ord. of 12-18-2000, § 12.6; Ord. of 8-20-2009(3)) 
                  Sec. 117-387. - Directional signs. 
                  Development applicants should provide, and the county may require, a program for off-premises directional signage to serve all businesses which do not directly access Georgia 400. These guidelines envision a system of "logo" directional signs, similar to the blue logo signs used on interstate highways, placed at corners of intersections, within or immediately outside public right-of-ways, to guide customers and patrons from the highway and along public frontage roads to their destinations.

                  The use of flags should be limited to the flying of one flag of the United States and one flag of the State of Georgia. Business logo flags or the use of multiple U.S. flags for purposes of advertising are strongly discouraged. 

                  North Lanier Court, GA. 400  northbound of SR 53 
                  • This site has a uniquely shaped monument style identification sign that is appropriately sited and sized with regard to area and height. 
                  • The size and height of the monument sign is a recommended practice. However, the real estate sign gives a billboard type of appearance to the site. 
                  • The real estate sign does not need to be sized for GA. 400 motorists, as appears to be the case here. Real estate signs should be considerably smaller in size. 

                  Shopping center northbound on GA. 400 north of SR 136 
                  • Sign blight—a discouraged practice that sets a dangerous precedent and visually degrades the visual character of the corridor. 
                  • Signs that pertain to businesses no longer operating in the shopping center must be removed. 
                  • Portable signs are strongly discouraged if not prohibited. 

                  Shopping center northbound on GA. 400 north of SR 136 
                  Another example of sign blight (discouraged practice) on the same site. Sign structures that used to provide signage for business that are no longer operating must be removed. 

                  Shopping center northbound on GA. 400 north of SR 136
                  Signs for the center should consist of one monument sign, not individual pole signs for multiple businesses as shown here (discouraged if not prohibited practice). 

                  Dawson 400 shopping center at  GA. 400 and SR 53 
                  The brick monument shopping center sign at Dawson 400, while massive in size, is attractive and landscaped around the base (a recommended practice). However, the top of the sign is not integrated into the masonry (a discouraged practice), and the changeable copy area is not appropriately scaled. The shopping center sign provides smaller areas for other retail tenants (e.g., Ace Hardware) (recommended practice). Notice the tall pole signs and billboards in the background contribute to the interchange's "strip" commercial appearance. 

                  Dawson Forest Apartments 
                  This monument entrance sign, with landscaping, is a recommended practice.

A strip of land along a property, lease line, or other border, never less than 15 feet, between one use and another or between an environmentally sensitive area and another use, to screen, separate and shield one use area from another and obstruct noise, illumination, visual, and other incompatibilities or nuisances. A buffer may be a natural, undisturbed area of trees and undergrowth that provides opaque or near opaque screening. A buffer, where sparsely vegetated, is replanted with trees and shrubs to enhance its screening functions to opaque or near opaque conditions. A fence or wall can be included within a buffer but a fence or wall in itself does not constitute a buffer.

The conservation of prime agricultural and forestry land use from intensive development into other uses is a primary objective of this classification and is encouraged. Some prime agricultural land is geographically located on land with constraints on intensive residential or commercial development, such as steep forested slopes or river valley floor plains; therefore, careful consideration should be given to changes in those areas.

Prior to administrative action on either the land use district or the issuance of a building or occupancy permit the applicant therefore shall be required to sign a waiver on a form prepared by the planning and development director which will indicate that the applicant understands that a use is ongoing adjacent to his use which will produce odors, noise, dust and other effects which may not be compatible with the applicant's development. Nevertheless, understanding the effects of the adjacent RA use, the applicant agrees by executing the form to waive any objection to those effects and understands that his district change and/or his permits are issued and processed in reliance on his agreement not to bring any action (asserting that the adjacent uses in the RA District constitute a nuisance) against local governments and adjoining landowners whose property is located in an RA District. Any such notice or acknowledgment provided to or executed by a landowner adjoining a tract in an RA District shall be a public record. 
                  Sec. 121-68. - RRE Residential Rural Estate. 
                  Residential estate districts are areas that are either primarily single family residential with other agricultural, pastoral or recreational uses incidental to the principal residential use, or areas that are not under intensive development pressures and are in relatively large parcels. Typical rural residential uses range from horticulture, agri-tourism, livestock and animal husbandry, to non-managed woodlands. The conservation of prime agricultural and forestry land use from the need to extend urbanized infrastructure (public water and sewer service) is a primary objective of this classification and is encouraged to maintain the rural character. Some prime agricultural land is geographically located on land with constraints on intensive residential or commercial development, such as steep forested slopes or river valley floor plains; therefore, careful consideration should be given to changes in those areas.

                  Sec. 121-69. - RPC Residential Planned Community. 
                  The Residential Planned Community District is a parcel of land developed with a variety of land uses which may vary from strict application of minimum standards in other land use classifications with the purpose of encouraging the development of large tracts of land as planned communities; encourage flexible and creative concepts in site planning; preserve the natural environment by encouraging scenic and functional open areas within residential areas; and provide for an efficient use of land resulting in increased efficiency in providing services, thus lowering development costs due to the smaller networks for streets and shorter utility lines. The Residential Planned Comprehensive Development is a flexible alternative which advocates the grouping or clustering of lots and buildings on a smaller portion of the tract, where the developer can maintain the same residential density but offer smaller lots, with remaining land dedicated or reserved for open space, agriculture, woodlands or recreation. 
                  (1)  Applicability. RPC is permitted only if a single developer or development group is planning and constructing the entire unit, including all amenities, and shall not be available to any development if any lots or parcels are sold to others before construction of amenities and buildings (excepting single family residences). Amenities may be shown as part of a specific phase(s) of the master plan and must be constructed accordingly. 
                  (2)  In the event of the failure of the developer to complete any portion of the approved plan, then all requirements of subdivision regulations shall be complete before sale of any lots or issuance of building or occupancy permits. 
                  (3)  The minimum acreage permitted for RPC is 100 contiguous acres. The amount of permanent open space or natural space required shall be no less than 40 percent of the development. An active amenity area consisting of at least a pool, clubhouse, and two tennis courts is required. The overall net density shall be no more than one unit per acre. In some cases, the health department may require a lower density for septic tank requirements based on soils and slope. 
                  (5)  An application for zoning and any development permits shall be preceded in each case by informal meeting with the planning staff prior to submission and shall be consistent with the format required for subdivision approval with the following additions: 
                  a.  A proposed master plan showing at minimum: 
                  1.  Total property area included in the development with a legal description of the subject property and bounds; 
                  2.  Proposed buildings with approximate square footage and footprints; 
                  3.  Proposed street layout; 
                  4.  Existing topographic conditions to include a contour interval of a minimum five feet based on field surveys or photogram metric photogrammetric methods; 
                  5.  Amenity areas and buildings, including defined open space;; 
                  6.  Traffic impact study.

                  d.  A master drainage plan shall be provided with the application for rezoning to identify the detention/retention and encourage creative water quality and quantity treatment processes. 
                  (6)  Lapse of approval shall occur two years after the approval of the development plan or if the applicant fails to reasonably maintain the development schedule (delay over six months for any phase of the project without satisfactory explanation). The planning commission may extend approval for one year at its discretion. Upon lapse of approval, all approved documents shall be revoked and the area shall be returned to the previous district classification following appropriate notice, hearings and approvals of the board of commissioners. The developer shall receive a minimum of 60-day's notice of intent to revoke approval prior to initiating the application. 
                  (7)  The approved rezoning to RPC shall automatically be conditioned upon the approved master plan regardless of ownership unless approval lapses pursuant to section 121-69(5). Any change or revision to the master plan after the initial rezoning or any change to any other zoning condition imposed by the county, shall require a rezoning application. The approved plan and any revisions shall be recorded in the office of the county clerk with the minutes of the meeting when the plan is approved or revised. 
                  (8)  Any major or substantial change in the approved master development plan that affects the intent and character of the development, increases the density or changes the land use pattern, changes the location or dimensions of streets or similar changes must be reviewed and approved by the Dawson County Board of Commissioners after review and recommendation by the planning commission before any work shall be permitted. A request for revision of the master development plan shall be supported by a written statement justifying the necessity or desirability for such revision. Any such major change shall be considered a request to change a zoning condition and shall be subject to rezoning procedures. 
                  (9)  Permitted uses. The following uses are allowed within this district. Uses not listed in this subsection are prohibited in this district.

                  Sec. 121-106. - Conditional uses. 
                  Purpose. The purpose of identifying conditional uses is to establish clear guidelines for those uses allowable within specific districts provided additional visual and site requirements, etc. are followed. These additional requirements are necessary to mitigate any potential impacts on adjoining properties that may occur due to the inclusion of a particular use. In many cases these conditional uses may be allowed with approval of the planning commission and board of commissioners without formal rezoning. The following uses are considered conditional by Dawson County and allowed with conditions as detailed in each subsection: 
                  (1)  Telecommunication towers and antennas. 
                  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to establish guidelines for the siting of all wireless, microwave towers, common carrier towers, cellular, television and radio telecommunications towers and antennas. The regulations and requirements set forth herein are adopted for the following purposes: 
                  a.  To provide for the location of communication towers and communication antennas in Dawson County; 
                  b.  To effect the visual impacts of communication towers and antennas through careful design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques; 
                  c.  To accommodate the growing need for communication towers and antennas while minimizing the total number of towers within the community necessary to provide adequate personal wireless services to residents of Dawson County; 
                  d.  To promote and encourage shared use/co-location of existing and new communication towers as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers; 
                  e.  To consider public health, safety and welfare; 
                  Applicability. 
                  a.  All new communication towers and communication antennas in Dawson County shall be subject to these regulations and all other applicable regulations. For purposes of measurement, communication tower setbacks and separation distances as set forth in this article shall be calculated and applied irrespective of County and municipal jurisdictional boundaries. 
                  b.  All communication towers and communication antennas legally existing on [date of adoption] shall be considered legal non-conforming uses, allowed to continue their usage as they presently exist: provided however, anything other than routine maintenance, including without limitation, structural modifications including provisions for additional antennas or additional providers and/or new construction on an existing communication tower, shall comply with the requirements of this article with the exception of separation distances. Routine maintenance shall be permitted on such existing towers. 
                  c.  The performance and construction standards provided for in this article shall apply to all new communication tower construction including such construction that shall occur in areas zoned under the commercial tower zoning designation established by the Land Use Resolution of Dawson County, now repealed. 
                  d.  All government towers with public safety systems or equipment shall be exempt from the requirements of this subsection. However, private facilities and structures proposed for placement on governmentally owned property shall not be exempt. 
                  e.  This ordinance shall not govern any tower, or the installation of any antenna, that is 35 feet or less in height and is owned and operated by a federally licensed amateur radio station operator from the operator's residence. 
                  General requirements. 
                  a.  Principal or accessory use. A tower and/or antenna is considered a principal use if located on any lot or parcel of land as the sole or primary structure, and is considered an accessory use if located on a lot or parcel shared with a different existing primary use or existing structure. An existing use or structure on the same lot or parcel shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with zoning district requirements, including but not limited to set-back, buffer and other requirements, the dimensions of an entire lot or parcel shall control, even though the antenna or tower may be located on a leased area within such lot or parcel. Towers that are constructed and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a non-conforming use or structure. Accessory structures to the tower are for that of the facility only, no offices, vehicles or material storage is allowed in structure. 
                  b.  Inventory of existing sites. To facilitate the co-location of antennas, each applicant seeking to locate a new tower, alternative tower structure or antenna, or to modify any such existing structure, shall provide to the department of planning and development an inventory of applicant's existing towers or alternative tower structures. Applicants seeking to erect an amateur radio tower or antenna as defined by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations shall be exempt from this provision. The inventory shall include all such structures that are within the jurisdiction of the governing authority; within a municipality located, in whole or in part, within Dawson County; and within a one mile border of Dawson County, and shall include specific information about the location (latitude and longitude coordinates), height, design, tower type and general suitability for antenna co-location of each tower, and other pertinent information as may be required by the department of planning and development. The department of planning and development may share such information with other applicants for a communication tower permit under this chapter or other organizations seeking to locate towers or antennas within the jurisdiction of the governing authority, provided, however that the department of planning and development is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. 
                  Application requirements. 
                  a.  Each conditional use application shall include a scaled site plan with topographical information, an elevation view, and other supporting drawings, calculations and documentation. 
                  b.  The site plan must include setbacks, drives, parking, fencing, landscaping, adjacent uses, also the distances to all structures within 1,000 feet, and any other information necessary to review the request.

Communication towers/antennas and their accessory structures shall comply with the minimum lot and setback requirements of the district in which they are located. In cases where there is a conflict between the minimum lot setback and street setback requirements, the greater setback shall apply. Guy wires and support anchors are required to meet setbacks; they shall not extend outside of the property line and must be contained within the fenced area of the tower site. 
                  c.  Separation from residential uses. Separation requirements for communication towers from residentially zoned lands, as outlined in article III of this chapter except those lands zoned R-A, or residential uses shall be a minimum of 195 linear feet. Communication tower separation shall be measured from the base of the tower to the closest point of off-site uses. 
                  d.  Separation distances between communication towers. Separation distances between communication towers shall be applicable for and measured between the proposed tower and those towers that are existing and/or have received land use or building permit approval from the county. The separation distances shall be measured by drawing or following a straight line from the base of the existing tower to the base of proposed tower, pursuant to a site plan, of the proposed tower. Minimum separation distances (listed in linear feet) shall be as follows: 

                   
                  e.  Fencing. A chain link fence or wall not less than six feet in height, from finished grade equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device shall be provided around each communication tower. Access to the tower shall be through a locked gate. 
                  f.  Landscaping. Landscaping shall mitigate the visual impacts of a communication tower. Where adequate vegetation is not present, tower facilities shall be landscaped with a landscape buffer that effectively screens the view of the tower compound. The use of existing vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent practicable and may be used as a substitute for or in supplement towards meeting landscaping requirements. 
                  1.  Landscape buffers shall be a minimum of ten feet in width and located outside the fenced perimeter of the tower compound; and 
                  2.  A row of trees a minimum of eight feet tall (planted height) and a maximum of 20 feet apart shall be planted around the perimeter of the fence; and 
                  3.  A continuous hedge at least 30 inches high at planting and capable of growing to at least 36 inches in height within 18 months shall be planted in front of the tree line referenced above; and 
                  4.  All landscaping shall be of the evergreen variety and conform with landscape standards to be approved by planning and development office at the time of permitting. 
                  5.  If existing foliage is to be used as buffer, it must be labeled and incorporated into site plan and approved through planning and development office. 
                  6.  Upon final installation of new trees, shrubs or other landscape material planted to meet the requirements of this section and prior to receipt of a certificate of occupancy, the owner shall either provide proof of warranty or post a maintenance bond or other acceptable surety, warranting the new material for a period of no less than one year. The bond shall be posted in an amount equal to 20 percent of the actual cost of the material and installation. 
                  i.  The department shall perform an inspection of the plantings and landscape materials required by these regulations prior to the expiration of the one year warranty or maintenance period. The tower owner shall be notified of any replacements or restoration that must be made to maintain compliance with these regulations. 
                  Required landscape materials found to be dead or near death shall be replaced prior to release by the department of the warranty or maintenance surety. In no case shall replacement be delayed more than 30 days from notification, unless a performance bond is posted with the department. Such performance shall be completed within six months of posting.

                  1.  The height change referred to in this subsection may only occur one time per communication tower. 
                  2.  The additional height referred to in this subsection shall not require an additional distance separation. The communication tower pre-modification height shall be used to calculate such distance separations. 
                  Illumination. Communication towers/antennas shall not be artificially lighted. 
                  Co-location. Proposed communication antennas may and are encouraged to co-locate onto existing communication towers, provided such co-location is accomplished in a manner consistent with zoning and performance standards, new or additional conditional use approval is not required. If it is determined by the county that the proposed tower is situated in a location which will benefit the county's telecommunication systems, then the tower shall be engineered and constructed to accommodate the additional telecommunication equipment beneficial to the public system at a cost to the county no greater than the actual expense of the provider in so engineering and constructing the tower to meet the county's needs. 
                  a.  Monopole communication towers shall be engineered and constructed to accommodate a minimum of three additional communication service providers.

                  Variances. Any request to deviate from any of the requirements of this section shall require approval of the planning commission. 
                  Documentation. Documentation to demonstrate conformance with the requirements of performance standards shall be submitted by the applicant with all requests to construct, locate or modify a communication tower/antenna. A statement by the applicant as to how construction of the communication tower will accommodate co-location of additional antennas for future users shall be included with the documentation. Documentation evidencing a present commitment from the proposed service providers to locate at the proposed site shall also be included by applicant, at time of permitting 
                  Signs and advertising. A small sign placed on the entrance gate of sufficient size, not to exceed four feet in total area shall display the name of the person or corporation owning the tower, the name of the person or corporation owning the property (if different from tower owner), FCC registration number and a current mailing address with a name and phone number of a person to contact in case of an emergency. All other signage is prohibited and the use of any portion of a tower for sign or advertising purposes including, without limitation, company name, banners, or streamers, is prohibited. 
                  Abandonment. Without waiving the county's right to determine whether or not a communication tower has been abandoned, it shall be the duty of the tower owner to notify the county in writing of any intent to abandon use of the tower. Said notice shall include steps that tower owner shall take to accomplish removal of the tower structures. In the event the use of any communication tower has been discontinued for a period of 180 consecutive days, the tower shall be deemed to have been abandoned. Upon such abandonment, the owner/operator of the tower shall have an additional 45 days within which to: (1) reactivate the use of the tower or transfer the tower to another owner/operator who makes actual use of the tower; or (2) dismantle and remove the tower. The owner of the tower shall be ultimately responsible for all costs of dismantling and removal and in the event the tower is not removed within 45 days of abandonment, the county may proceed to do so and assess the costs against the tower owner. The lien of such assessment shall bear interest, have priority and be collectable at the same rate and in the like manner as provided for by Georgia Law. At the earlier of 46 days from the date of abandonment without reactivation or upon completion of dismantling and removal, any conditional use permit, waiver and/or variance approval for the tower shall automatically expire. 
                  Finished color. Communication towers not requiring FAA painting/marking shall have either galvanized finish or be painted with a non-reflective paint in a non-contrasting blue, gray or black finish. The color should be selected so as to minimize the equipment's visibility. 
                  Maintenance. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall be maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the governing authority concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance within such standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said 30 days, the governing authority may remove such tower at the owners' expense. Any such removal by the governing authority shall be in that manner provided in Sections 41-2-8 through 41-2-17 of the Official Code of Georgia. 
                  Liability insurance. Liability insurance in an amount not less than $1,000,000 shall be maintained by the owner and operator of the facility until such facility is dismantled and removed from the parent site. Failure to maintain insurance coverage shall constitute a violation of this Code and grounds for revocation of conditional use approval. Proof of same shall be supplied to the department of planning and development upon application for permit.

No property owner shall be deprived of access to his property. Access easements acquired before the enactment of this chapter may be 20 feet wide and property before the effective date of this chapter with at least 20 feet of frontage shall, as an exception, not be required to acquire additional frontage where the necessary property to acquire 30 feet is owned by another person. 
                  Sec. 121-166. - Maintenance of minimum resolution requirements. 
                  No person shall, by deed, gift, or other conveyance, reduce the lot size under minimum requirements unless given for public use or a variance is approved therefore. 
                  Sec. 121-167. - Conditional uses. 
                  Conditional uses are those uses by variance, which set out specific conditions as requirements for that variance. If those specific conditions are violated or omitted, the use previously authorized is automatically revoked and the property reverted to the use before the variance or conditional use was granted without further action by the planning commission or county commissioner. 
                  Sec. 121-168. - Non-conforming uses. 
                  Any structure or use of land existing before the enactment of this chapter, unless in violation of subdivision regulations, mobile home park and mobile home regulations, or soil erosion and sediment control resolution previously in effect, not in conformity with district use provisions, may be continued; provided, however, the non-conforming use shall not be:

                  (5)  Replaced, except the replacement of an old or destroyed manufactured housing with new manufactured housing when the manufactured housing is the primary residence and occupied by the owner. 
                  (6)  For commercial and business purposes, a legal non-conforming status is proven by possession of a valid, legally obtained, Dawson County Business License within the past 12 months 
                  Sec. 121-169. - Off-street parking and loading spaces required. 
                  Except and unless otherwise specifically provided, this Section shall apply only to properties located within the RB, CB, HB, OI, CPCD, CIR, and IA Zoning Districts. 
                  (1)  Off-street automobile parking and loading spaces shall be provided, as specified in this section, for uses and structures hereafter established in the IA and all commercial districts at the time of initial construction of any principal building, unless otherwise exempted from this chapter. For developments phased in timing, parking and loading requirements may also be phased in accordance with the requirements applying for each particular time phase of development. 
                  (2)  Any building or use that is subsequently enlarged or converted to another use shall meet the off-street parking and loading space requirements of this section, for the enlarged or new use. 
                  (3)  Required parking and loading spaces shall be maintained and shall not be encroached upon by refuse containers, signs or other structures, unless an equal number of spaces are provided elsewhere in conformance with this chapter. 
                  (4)  Required parking and loading spaces shall be provided with vehicular access to a public street or alley, unless such access is prohibited by this chapter. 
                  (5)  Off-street parking and loading facilities required shall be located on the same lot as the principal building or use. However, as much as 50 percent of the required number of parking spaces may be located within 400 feet of the principal building or use, provided proof of ownership or a valid lease agreement for use of such premises is provided to the administrative officer. Such distance shall be measured between the nearest point of the parking facility and the nearest point of the principal building or use. 
                  Sec. 121-170. - Minimum number of off-street parking spaces required. 
                  The minimum number of required off-street parking spaces for each type of permitted use shall be as indicated below. For uses not specifically listed, the off-street parking requirements shall be those of the most similar use as determined by the administrative officer. The administrative officer may also reference the latest American Planning Associations Parking Standards Report. When referencing APA Reports weight should be given to the jurisdiction listed with a population density closest to that of Dawson County. When the application of these parking requirements results in a fractional space requirement, the fractional space requirement shall be construed to mean one additional space.

                  Sec. 121-179. - Lots of record. 
                  The following allowances and modifications to lots of record can be made, or are deemed to be made by certain actions. 
                  (1)  Although a lot may not contain sufficient land area, width or lot frontage to meet the minimum lot size requirements of this chapter, such lot may be used as a building site if all other requirements of the district are met and that building plans are consistent with all state and local health codes. 

                  Example A: Parcel A conforms, Parcel B has non-conforming lot size 
                  (2)  The line between two adjoining lots of record that are non-conforming as to lot size may be modified only such that neither lot becomes smaller. If a non-conforming lot of record adjoins a lot that meets or exceeds lot size standards, then the line may be modified only such that the non-conforming lot does not become smaller, and the conforming lot is not made non-conforming. 

                  Example B: Re-plat of both lots such that Parcel A is the same size and Parcel B is not smaller 
                  (3)  If a building is proposed for construction across the line between two lots of record under the same ownership that are non-conforming as to the lot size or frontage, then the lots shall be resurveyed and recorded to be combined. If a building is proposed for construction within a setback between two lots of record under the same ownership that are non-conforming as to lot size or frontage, then the lots may be resurveyed and recorded to be combined, or a request for a setback variance may be considered. 

                  Example C1: Same owner for both parcels. Requires re-plat of property to remove separation 

                  Example C2: Same owner for both parcels. Proposal to build in setback of one parcel. Requires re-plat or variance approval 
                  (4)  A lot that is non-conforming in one dimensional criteria, but conforming to other criteria, may be modified such that the conforming criteria is rendered non-conforming, and the non-conforming criteria is not made non-conforming to a greater extent. For example, if a non-conforming lot of record has less than the required lot frontage, but has excess lot area, then the lot area can be reduced as long as the lot maintains the minimum lot area. However, the lot frontage cannot be reduced. 

                  Example D1: Existing lot with less than required lot frontage, but more than the minimum acreage required 

                  Example D2: Existing lot with new side lot line and minimum required acreage NOTE: no change in Lot Frontage 
                  (5)  If a legal lot of record is resurveyed for combination, line change or other alteration in accordance with this section and recorded with the clerk of court's office, then; the most recent recorded plat takes precedence and shall be considered the new lot of record.

                  The land use resolution district map is hereby designated to be section 121-207 of this chapter. Any reference to the "district map" in this chapter refers to the official land use resolution district map. 
                  Sec. 121-203. - Identification, alternation, and replacement of the district map. 
                  (a)  The district map is signed by the commissioner with witnessing signature of the county clerk and bears the commissioner's seal under the following words: "This certifies that this is the Land Use Resolution of Dawson County, Georgia," together with the date of the adoption of this chapter. 
                  (b)  The district map may be altered only if the proposed alterations area in conformance with the future land use map (article VIII), and sound planning principles. Any alteration to the district map is an amendment to this chapter. The procedure by which amendments are proposed and approved is contained in article XII. Any amendment involving changes in land use district boundaries must be entered on the district map as soon as the amendment has been approved by the commissioner. The entry should be as follows: "On (date) by official action of the Commissioner, the following changes (or changes) were made on the Official Land Use Resolution District Map: (Brief description of change.)" It shall be signed by the commissioner with witnessing signature of the county clerk. No amendment to portions of this chapter that are illustrated on the district map becomes effective until after the change has been entered as described above on the district map. Any authorized alteration of the district map by any person is a violation of this chapter. The official land use resolution district map is located in the planning department and is the final authority as to the current status of land use district boundaries. 
                  (c)  If the district map becomes damaged destroyed, lost, or difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of changes and additions, the commissioner may adopt a new district map, which will replace the previous district map. The new district map is identified as such in the same manner as described above. When the new district map is adopted, a notation should be made on the previous district map that it is no longer valid, indicating the date that the new district map was adopted, as a reference aid. The previous district map should be preserved, if it has not been lost or destroyed, for possible future reference. 
                  Sec. 121-204. - Criteria to be considered in amending the district map. 
                  The following points should be addressed when considering proposed amendments to the district map. In determining whether or not a proposed amendment satisfactorily addresses the points stated below, sound planning principles should be followed. 
                  (1)  Proposed amendment should be in conformance with the Dawson County Future District Map. 
                  (2)  Findings of fact must be presented and accepted in support of such an amendment. 
                  (3)  Proposed amendment should meet demonstrated changes in community needs. 
                  (4)  The factors indicating suitability of land to be placed within a certain land use district should be considered. These criteria are contained in section 121-313. 
                  Sec. 121-205. - District boundaries. 
                  Where uncertainty exists with respect to the exact location of the boundary of a land use district shown on the district map, the following guidelines should be followed in establishing the exact location of the boundary: 
                  (1)  Where a land use district boundary is indicated as approximately following the center line of a street or road, or as approximately following the right-of-way line, that line should be considered to be the boundary. 
                  (2)  Where a land use district boundary is indicated as approximately following the corporate limit line of the city, the corporate limit line should be considered to be the boundary. 
                  (3)  Where a land use district boundary is indicated as approximately following a property line or such line extended, the line or lines extended should be considered to be the boundary. 
                  (4)  Where a land use district boundary is indicated approximately following the center of a stream bed, such should be considered to be the boundary. 
                  (5)  Where a land use district boundary is indicated as approximately parallel to the center line of a street, road, railroad, or the right-of-way of such a facility, such boundary shall be interpreted to be parallel to such line and at a distance from it as indicated by scale on the district map. 
                  (6)  Where a land use district boundary line is indicated as dividing a lot in single ownership at the time of the enactment of the resolution, the development standards for the land use district in which the greater portion of the lot lies must be extended to the balance of the lot up to a distance of 35 feet beyond the actual boundary line of the land use district. 
                  Sec. 121-206. - Relationship between district map and future district map. 
                  (a)  The future district map as adopted by the board of commissioners and adopted by the commissioner. It should provide the best possible indication of desirable future district patterns that will meet projected future demand for land uses of various types. 
                  (b)  The land use districts contained on the district map carry standards which must be met by all new developments and construction in the county. The arrangement of land use districts is based on existing land use patterns. Establishment and amendments of land use district boundaries must be based on defensible findings of fact as well as sound comprehensive planning principles. 
                  Sec. 121-207. - Land use resolution district map. 
                  The Dawson County Land Use Resolution District Map shall be cited as section 121-207, and shall be a part of this chapter. The map shall be located in the planning department and in the office of the planning department. 
                  Sec. 121-208. - Zoning compliance. 
                  (a)  Intent. The primary determination whether a proposed use is proper in a given use district is made by the department of planning and zoning. Interpretations of the department concerning the meaning of the resolution may be important in a particular case. Persons should not expend money on project development until the department has determined in writing that the proposed use is proper. 
                  (b)  Certificate. A certificate of zoning compliance shall be issued on a form to be determined by the department as evidence that a proposed use complies with the resolution. 
                  (c)  Reliance. Until a certificate of zoning compliance is obtained with regard to a particular project, a person expending money in any way on project planning or development does so at his own risk. No person shall be deemed to have expended funds in reliance on zoning provisions unless and until the certificate of zoning compliance is obtained.

                  ARTICLE VIII. - FUTURE DISTRICT MAP 

                  Sec. 121-240. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this article is to provide for a future district map; background concepts of the future district map; identification, alteration, and replacement of the future district map; and criteria to be considered in amending the future district map. 
                  Sec. 121-241. - Background concepts of the future district map. 
                  The future district map represents a synthesis of data concerning population, land use patterns, and economic activity, etc. The planning commission has studied these data and conceived a set of goals to provide suitable space for anticipated future development while the public health, safety, and welfare is protected. The map contains an arrangement of land uses, which permits minimum adverse impact on neighboring land uses and on safety conditions, while maximum efficiency in providing community and utility services is achieved. The future district map represents the planning commission's projection of how land use patterns in Dawson County should look in the medium-to-long-range future. The development standards and other requirements contained in this chapter are intended to encourage the development of the land use patterns depicted on the future district map. Existing and future land uses are not regulated or controlled by the future district map as they are by the district map. 
                  Sec. 121-242. - Identification, alteration, and replacement of the future district map. 
                  (a)  The future district map is signed by the commissioner with witnessing signature of the county clerk and bears the seal of the county or that of a notary public under the following words: 
                  "This certifies that his [this] is the Dawson County Future District Map referred to in Article 804 [section 121-244] of the Land Use Resolution, Dawson County, Georgia," together with the date of the adoption of the resolution. 
                  (b)  The future district map may be altered only if the proposed alterations are in conformance with sound comprehensive planning principles. Any alteration to the future district map is an amendment to this chapter. 
                  (c)  The procedure by which amendments are proposed and approved is contained in article XII. Any amendment to the future district map must be entered on that map as soon as the amendment has been approved by the commissioner. The entry should be as follows: 
                  "On (date), by official action of the County Commissioner, the following change (or changes) were made in the Dawson County Future District Map: (Brief description of change.)" It should be signed by the commissioner with the witnessing signature of the county clerk. No amendments to the future district map become effective until after the change and only by the procedures contained in this article. Any unauthorized alteration of the future district map is a violation of this chapter. 
                  (d)  The future district map is located in the commissioner's office. If it becomes damaged, destroyed, lost, or difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of changes or additions, the commissioner may adopt a new future district map, which will replace the previous identified as such in the same manner as described above in this section. When the new future district map is adopted, a notation should be made on the previous future district map that it is no longer valid, indicating the date that the new future district map was adopted as a reference aid. The previous future district map should be preserved, if it has not been lost or destroyed, for possible future reference. 
                  Sec. 121-243. - Criteria to be considered in amending the future district map. 
                  The following points should be addressed when considering proposed amendments to the future district map. In determining whether or not a proposed amendment satisfactorily addresses the points stated below, sound planning principles should be used. 
                  (1)  Findings of fact must be presented and accepted in support of the proposed amendment. 
                  (2)  The proposed amendment should meet demonstrated changes in community needs. 
                  (3)  The proposed amendment should be consistent with indications of current available population, economic, and land use data upon which information depicted on the future district map is based. 
                  Sec. 121-244. - Future district map. 
                  The future district map shall be cited as section 121-244, and shall be a part of this chapter. The Map shall be located in the county commissioner's office.

                  ARTICLE IX. - VARIANCES 

                  Sec. 121-267. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of a variance is to provide relief when a strict application of the district requirements would impose unusual practical difficulties or unnecessary physical hardships on the applicant. Practical difficulties and unnecessary hardships may result from the size, shape, or dimensions of a site or the location of existing structures thereon; from geographic, topographic, or other conditions on the site or in the immediate vicinity. No variance shall be granted to allow the use of property for a purpose not authorized within the district in which the proposed use would be located. A variance should be granted only after evidence is presented and accepted that enforcement of all of the required standards on the property in question would render the property useless. This article establishes conditions; criteria for granting variances; public hearings on proposed variances; variances to road requirements; variance procedures; compliance with conditions of approval; vested interest in approved variances; investigations and reports; revocation; limitations on re-applications; and use variance. 
                  Sec. 121-268. - Conditions. 
                  (a)  Reasonable conditions may be imposed in connection with a variance as deemed necessary to protect the best interests of the surrounding property or neighborhood, and otherwise secure the purpose and requirements of this article. Guarantees and evidence may be required that such conditions will be and are being complied with. 
                  (b)  The planning commission is responsible for considering and making recommendations on applications for variances. Variances apply only to the land use standards and requirements specified for each district. They do not apply to other provisions of this chapter. 
                  (c)  The variance must specify which development standards and requirements are to be varied from. It must specify alternative standards and requirements to be met, replacing those varied from. 
                  Sec. 121-269. - Criteria for granting variances. 
                  Variances to standards and requirements of this chapter, with respect to open area, setbacks, yard area, lot coverage, height of structures, vision clearance, and other quantitative requirements may be granted only if, on the basis of the application, investigation, and evidence submitted by the applicant, investigation, and evidence submitted by the applicant, all four expressly written findings below are made: 
                  (1)  That a strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of the specified standard or requirement would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship; and 
                  (2)  That there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applicable to the property involved or to the intended use of the property which do not apply generally to other properties in the same district; and 
                  (3)  That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare or materially injurious to properties or improvements in the near vicinity; and 
                  (4)  That the granting of the variance would support general objectives contained within this chapter. 
                  Variances in accordance with this article should not ordinarily be granted if the special circumstances on which the applicant relies are a result of the actions of the applicant or owner or previous owners. 
                  Sec. 121-270. - Public hearing on proposed variances. 
                  Public hearings on proposed variances shall be in accordance with procedures set forth in article XII, section 121-373, of this chapter. 
                  Sec. 121-271. - Variances to road and street requirements. 
                  (a)  Variances to requirements of this chapter with respect to road and street requirements may be authorized as applied for or as modified by the county commission if, on the basis of the application, investigation, and the evidence submitted by the applicant, all three of the following expressly written findings are made: 
                  (1)  That neither present nor anticipated future traffic volumes generated by the use of the site or use of sites in the vicinity require strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of the requirements of this chapter; and 
                  (2)  That the granting of the variance will not result in the development or design of public streets in such a manner as to interfere with the free flow of traffic on the streets; and 
                  (3)  That the granting of the variance will not create a safety hazard or any other condition inconsistent with the general purpose of this chapter. 
                  (b)  The county commission may establish performance bonds to assure compliance with any requirements it has set for granting a variance. Where a variance is granted for a construction activity requiring a building permit, the building permit must be obtained and construction have begun within six months of the issuance of the variance. Otherwise, the variance expires after six months. 
                  Sec. 121-272. - Variance procedures. 
                  (a)  Before, the planning commission may act on a variance; it shall give notice of a public hearing in the manner prescribed in article XII, section 121-373. 
                  (b)  The planning commission shall review the application and investigation report at the public hearing. The planning commission shall determine whether the evidence supports a finding that the required criteria have been met and recommend approval with condition, or denial of the application accordingly. Their recommendations shall be in writing and shall include written findings on each of the applicable criteria. If the planning commission fails to take action within 30 days after the public hearing, the request shall be deemed to have been approved. 
                  (c)  Decision on variance requests shall be the responsibility of the planning commission and shall become final after an elapsed period of 30 days from the date of decision. 
                  (d)  The planning commission's decision, with findings, shall be sent by mail to the applicant within five working days of the date of action. 
                  (e)  From time to time the planning commission may find it necessary to require a variance request to also meet approval of the Dawson County Board of Commissioners. In doing so the variance request must follow the public hearing procedures prescribed in article XII, section 121-373. 
                  (f)  An application of a variance which is not acted upon by the commissioner within 90 days from the receipt of application may be deemed denied. 
                  (g)  Application for a variance shall be filed with the planning director on the form prescribed by the county, by any person with a legal interest in the property. 
                  Sec. 121-273. - Compliance with conditions of approval. 
                  Compliance with conditions imposed in the variance, and adherence to the submitted plans, as approved, is required. Any departure from these conditions of approval and approved plans constitutes a violation of this chapter. 
                  Sec. 121-274. - Vested interest in approved variances. 
                  A valid variance supersedes conflicting provisions of subsequent rezonings or amendments to this chapter unless specifically provided otherwise by the provisions of this article or the conditions of approval to the variance. 
                  Sec. 121-275. - Investigations and reports. 
                  The planning director shall make or cause to be made an investigation to provide necessary information to insure that the action on each application is consistent with the variance criteria and shall make a recommendation to the planning commission. Any report of such investigation shall be included in the application file. 
                  Sec. 121-276. - Revocation. 
                  Variances shall be automatically revoked if not exercised within one year of the date of approval. 
                  Sec. 121-277. - Limitations on re-applications. 
                  Applications for which a substantially similar application has been denied shall be heard by the planning commission only after a period of 12 months has elapsed. 
                  Sec. 121-278. - Use variance. 
                  No variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by this chapter. 
                  Sec. 121-279. - Withdrawal of application. 
                  Withdrawals of any application may be accommodated within the planning department if requested before the planning commission agenda is set. Therefore, withdrawals may not be made after ten days prior to the scheduled planning commission meeting hearing, unless accompanied by written request stating specific reasons for withdrawal. This withdrawal request is to be published in the legal organ prior to the meeting. Following that written request and publication the commission will vote to remove the item from the agenda at the scheduled hearing. Please note that should the withdrawal be denied, the item will receive deliberation and public hearing with a decision by the commission. Further the applicant is encouraged to be present at the hearing to substantiate reasons for withdrawal. Please note that no refund of application fee may be made unless directed by the board of commissioners. 
                  Sec. 121-280. - Administrative variances. 
                  The director of planning and development shall have the power to grant variances (except for density and use) from the development standards of the Land Use Resolution of Dawson County, Georgia if the intent of the ordinance can be achieved and equal performance obtained by granting a variance. 
                  (1)  Authority. The authority to grant variances in accord with this section shall be limited to variances from the following requirements: 
                  a.  Front yard or a yard adjacent to a public street—Variances shall not exceed ten feet; 
                  b.  Side yard—Variances shall not exceed five feet; 
                  c.  Rear yard—Variances shall not exceed ten feet; 
                  d.  Building height—A variance may be granted up to, but not exceeding, ten feet if such variance does not allow space habitable by humans and is also approved by the fire marshal and would not result in an increase in the number of stories that would otherwise be allowed by the zoning district; 
                  e.  Buffers—The dimensions of a landscaping buffer required by the Land Use Resolution of Dawson County or the Dawson County Tree, Landscape, and Buffer Ordinance may be varied by no more than 25 percent if the adopted comprehensive plan recommends a similar or more compatible use of the neighboring property or in other situations if the intent of the required buffer can be equally achieved; however, no buffer required as a condition of zoning shall be modified; 
                  f.  Parking—If the required parking standards cannot reasonably be met and if a variance will not adversely affect the spirit or intent of the ordinance or the Land Use Resolution of Dawson County, then a variance of not more than ten percent may be granted; 
                  g.  Home occupations—If the intended use is clearly allowed pursuant to the definition of "home occupation", then an administrative variance may be granted to conduct such business. 
                  (2)  Notification. The applicant may choose to either submit an affidavit attesting to notice that includes signatures of all adjoining property owners listed within the application package or the applicant may choose to permit written notice from the county planning department to adjoining property owners of the variance application and then wait at least ten business days from notice to all adjoining property owners before the variance may be considered for approval. Also, notice of the variance application shall be posted upon the property ten days before the variance is considered and shall state the variance requested and the date the variance shall be considered. 
                  (3)  Basis for approval. The following criteria shall be considered by the Director before allowing an administrative variance. No variance may be granted administratively for an application for a variance that has been heard by the planning commission within one year or if the application is for the expansion of a non-conforming use or structure. 
                  a.  The variance neither interferes with the rights of others as provided in this chapter nor is injurious to the public health, safety, general welfare; 
                  b.  A strict interpretation and enforcement of the standards or requirement would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship; 
                  c.  No exceptional or extraordinary circumstances applicable to the subject property exist that do not generally apply to other properties in the same district; 
                  d.  The variance provides for reasonable use under the specified circumstances of each application; 
                  e.  The variance achieves the general intent of the land use resolution of Dawson County; 
                  f.  The variance is the minimum possible variance under the specific circumstances; and 
                  g.  The variance does not exceed the scope of the authority set forth in subsection (1) hereof. 
                  (4)  Conditions of approval. The director of planning and development may impose reasonable conditions upon any administrative variance to ensure that the public health, safety, and general welfare are protected. A violation of any imposed condition shall be a violation of this section. 
                  (5)  Administration. After all requirements for a variance application in accord with the terms hereof are received, the planning and development department shall review and certify that all required information is complete and that the request is within the limits of consideration set forth in subsection (1) hereof. The applicant shall then be advised to proceed with public notice in accord with subsection (2) hereof. After required notice has been provided and the time period for response has passed, the planning director shall have ten business days to render a decision. Notice of the decision shall be provided to the applicant by mailing such decision within five business days of the decision. Notice of the action taken by the planning director shall be provided to the Planning Commission of Dawson County and shall be placed as an item of old business for no further action upon the agenda of the planning commission within 31 days. 
                  (6)  Compliance with other county codes. The effect of an administrative variance approval shall be that a specific request is determined to be appropriate for a specific location. The administrative variance application shall not approve a site plan nor waive or modify any other requirements of any other county code other than as specifically granted pursuant to the variance. 
                  (7)  Appeal. The applicant or an adjoining property owner may appeal to the county commission the decision of the planning director regarding an administrative variance within ten days of the decision via written objection and appeal. Any such appeal shall be heard by the Dawson County Board of Commissioners in accord with the standard appeal procedure.

                  (b)  One copy of the plan shall be returned to the subdivider or his agent, one copy forwarded to the appropriate public health agency, and one copy retained in the records of the planning and development department. 
                  (c)  Approval of a concept plan does not constitute approval of a preliminary plat or final plat, but indicates only approval of the layout as a guide to the preparation of the preliminary plat.

                  Sec. 133-115. - Minor subdivision plat specifications (not applicable to commercial/industrial districts). 
                  (a)  Purpose and intent. It is intended that the subdivision process comply with this section to allow for subdivision of land up to five lots. It is the intent of the board of commissioners to prohibit the practice of "chain" subdivisions where the same or related landowners seek to subdivide consecutive and/or contiguous minor subdivisions to avoid the requirements of a major subdivision. It is also the intent of the board of commissioners to prohibit minor subdivisions adjacent to each other within a five-year period if the original tract of land is owned by another person or entity and was transferred or sold to circumvent the major subdivision requirements. The planning and development director and public works director have the discretion to require a major subdivision plat if a minor subdivision plat does not conform with the purposes and intent of the minor subdivision plat specifications. 
                  (b)  General requirements. The minor subdivision plat shall conform to all applicable regulations regarding subdivision of land and the Dawson County Minor Subdivision Plat Review Checklist in addition to the following requirements: 
                  (1)  No more than five lots will be created from the parent tract within a five-year period. 
                  (2)  Minimum lot size shall be regulated according to the Land Use Resolution (chapter 121 of this Code). 
                  (3)  Extension of common driveways onto adjacent tracts beyond the subdivision of a maximum of five lots will not be allowed. 
                  (4)  No further subdivision will be allowed within five years of the approval of the minor subdivision plat. 
                  (5)  Dawson County Public Works reserves the right to require the applicant to submit a stormwater management plan with the minor subdivision plan. 
                  (6)  Common driveways shall be centered in a 30-foot-wide access and utility easement. 
                  (7)  Submittal, review, approval and recording of a minor subdivision plat shall be in accordance with the procedures for a final plat contained in sections 133-111 through 133-114. 
                  (c)  General plat and plan appearance. The Georgia Plat Act (O.C.G.A. § 15-6-67) and Dawson County Minor Subdivision Plat Review Checklist shall govern the appearance and size of the documents. 
                  (d)  Access. Access to minor subdivisions may be provided by either existing public streets or a common private driveway. Profiles of common private driveways will be required to be submitted with the minor subdivision plat. 
                  (e)  Flag lots. No more than two flag lots shall adjoin one another. The "pole" portion of the flag lot shall be a minimum of 30 feet wide for its entire length. Multiple individual driveways are discouraged. One common private driveway is preferred to serve multiple lots. No two "flag" portions of the lot shall be contiguous. 
                  (f)  Maintenance of common elements. The common private driveway and all other common elements of the minor subdivision shall be owned and maintained by a mandatory property owners' association. Dawson County will not be responsible for maintenance of common private driveways or other common elements. The minor subdivision plat shall contain the following note in large bold letters: "The Common Private Driveway shown on this plat is the responsibility of the property owners' association or property owner. Dawson County will not maintain the Common Private Driveway."

                  (1)  Residential subdivision projects. Sidewalks shall be installed on new internal streets (including "eyebrow" turnarounds) and on abutting external streets (abutting side). Sidewalks are not required adjacent to cul-de-sac turnarounds or on streets ending in a cul-de-sac turnaround which provide access to five or fewer lots. Sidewalks may end at the radius transition of a cul-de-sac turnaround with an L-shaped "mid-block" curb ramp in alignment with the ramp on the opposite side of the street. 
                  a.  Residential subdivision developer responsibility. Developers shall install sidewalks on abutting external streets, "passive" recreation area lots, common area lots, and open space lots, and shall install intersection radius curb ramps at new street intersections, and L-shaped mid-block ramps at cul-de-sac turnarounds, within 60 days of approval of the final plat. Sidewalks on "active" recreation area lots shall be installed prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy or shall be installed by the developer prior to release of the subdivision maintenance surety, whichever is earlier. Developers shall also install sidewalks on any vacant lots remaining between developed lots (i.e. dwellings under construction or completed) prior to release of the subdivision maintenance surety. 
                  b.  Homebuilder responsibility. Homebuilders shall install sidewalks, and curb ramps not required to be installed by developers, on building lots prior to release of the certificate of occupancy for a home. It is the developers responsibility to meet all compaction standards as outlined in AASHTO Method T-99, See section 133-260, grading. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential subdivision projects. Sidewalks shall be installed by the developer on new internal streets (both sides including cul-de-sac and "eyebrow" turnarounds) and on abutting external streets (abutting side) within 60 days of approval of the final plat. 
                  (3)  Maintenance surety. Maintenance surety provided to the county shall include 20 percent of the cost of all sidewalk construction in an amount acceptable to the county. 
                  (4)  Escrow alternative. The cost of sidewalk installation may be set aside in escrow with the department of public works if proposed road improvements by the county may impact the location of a sidewalk.

                  (10)  Potential connections of protected open space with existing greenspace and trails, including adjacent protected areas or adjacent non-protected natural lands that are possible candidates for inclusion as part of a future area of protected greenspace. 
                  (b)  Open space management plan required. An open space management plan, as described in section 133-297(e), shall be prepared and submitted prior to the issuance of a land disturbance permit. 
                  (c)  Instrument of permanent protection required. An instrument of permanent protection, such as a conservation easement or permanent restrictive covenant and as described in section 133-297(f), shall be placed on the open space concurrent with the issuance of a land disturbance permit. 
                  (d)  Four step design process. All sketch plans or conceptual design plans for conservation subdivisions shall include documentation of a four-step design process in determining the layout of proposed open space lands, house sites, streets and lot lines, as described below. 
                  (1)  Step 1: Delineation of open space lands. 
                  a.  The minimum percentage and acreage of required open space lands shall be calculated by the applicant and submitted as part of the concept plan or preliminary plat (whichever is submitted first) in accordance with the provisions of this article. Open space lands shall include all primary conservation areas and those parts of the secondary conservation areas with the highest resource significance, as described in subsections (d)(1)c and d of this section. 
                  b.  Proposed open space lands shall be designated using the site analysis map as a base map and complying with section 133-297(b), dealing with open space design standards. The Dawson County Greenspace Plan shall also be referenced and considered. 
                  c.  In delineating Secondary Conservation Areas, the applicant shall prioritize natural and cultural resources on the tract in terms of their highest to least suitabilities for inclusion in the proposed open space. 
                  d.  On the basis of those priorities and practical considerations given to the tract's configuration, its context in relation to resources areas on adjoining and neighboring properties, and the applicant's subdivision objectives, secondary conservation areas shall be delineated so that, together with all primary conservation areas, they meet at least the minimum area percentage requirements for open space lands. Secondary conservation areas should also be delineated in a manner clearly indicating their boundaries as well as the types of resources included within them. 
                  (2)  Step 2: Location of house sites. Potential house sites shall be tentatively located, using the proposed open space lands as a base map as well as other relevant data on the site analysis map such as topography and soils. House sites should generally be located not closer than 100 feet from primary conservation areas and 50 feet from secondary conservation areas, taking into consideration the potential negative impacts of residential development on such areas as well as the potential positive benefits of such locations to provide attractive views and visual settings for residences. 
                  (3)  Step 3: Alignment of streets and trails. Upon designating the house sites, a street plan shall be designed to provide vehicular access to each house, and bearing a logical relationship to topographic conditions. Impacts of the street plan on proposed open space lands shall be minimized, particularly with respect to crossing environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands and traversing slopes exceeding 15 percent. Street connections shall generally be encouraged to minimize the number of new cul-de-sacs to be maintained by the municipality, when reasonable based upon the site features, and to facilitate access to and from homes in different parts of the tract (and adjoining parcels). 
                  (4)  Step 4: Drawing in the lot lines. Upon completion of the preceding three steps, lot lines are drawn as required to delineate the boundaries of individual residential lots. 
                  (e)  Other requirements. The applicant shall adhere to all other applicable requirements of the underlying zoning from chapter 121, land use, and this chapter.

                  Sec. 133-328. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of a variance is to provide relief when a strict application of the subdivision regulations would impose unusual practical difficulties or unnecessary physical hardships on the applicant. Practical difficulties and unnecessary hardships may result from the size, shape or dimensions of a site or the location of existing structures thereon; from geographic, topographic, or other conditions on the site or in the immediate vicinity. No variance shall be granted to allow the use of property for a purpose not authorized or in a manner not authorized by the subdivision regulations.

                  Sec. 133-330. - Criteria for granting variances. 
                  Variances may be granted only if, on the basis of the application, investigation, and evidence submitted by the applicant, all four expressly written findings below are made: 
                  (1)  That a strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of the specified standard; or 
                  (2)  Requirement would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship; and 
                  (3)  That these are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions; 
                  (4)  Applicable to the property involved or to the intended use of the property which do not apply generally to other properties; and 
                  (5)  That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare; and 
                  (6)  That the granting of the variance would support the general objectives contained within this chapter. Variances in accordance with this article should not ordinarily be granted if the special circumstances on which the applicant relies are a result of the actions of the applicant or owner or previous owners.

                  Sec. 133-331. - Variance procedures. 
                  The following procedures apply: 
                  (1)  Application for variance shall be filed with the planning commission on the form prescribed by the county, by any person with a legal interest in the property. The application shall specify the requirement(s) from which the applicant seeks a variance, the reasons said variance is necessary, and the plans, and other information required by the application in order to aide the decision makers. 
                  (2)  The planning commission shall review the application and investigation report at the public hearing. The planning commission shall determine whether the evidence supports a finding that the required criteria have been met and recommend approval with conditions (if applicable), or denial of the application accordingly. 
                  (3)  Appeals may be processed in accordance with sections 133-407 and 133-408 of this chapter.

                  (1)  Conveyance by warranty or quit claim deed with consideration recited in the deed as "love and affection," and 
                  (2)  The grantor and grantee are related as follows: 
                  a.  Parent and child; or 
                  b.  Brother and brother, sister and sister and/or brother and sister; or 
                  c.  Grandparent and grandchild; or 
                  d.  Aunt/uncle and niece/nephew; and 
                  (3)  The conveyance meets all other applicable criteria for a variance under this resolution; and
