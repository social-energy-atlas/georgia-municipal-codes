PREFACE 
PRM LAW PUBLISHERS, a division of Public Research and Management, Inc., of Atlanta, Georgia, is pleased to publish the Code of East Point, Georgia. This volume contains the City Charter, related laws and the code of ordinances of the city. 
The Code of Ordinances is an entirely new codification of all ordinances of a general and permanent nature. All obsolete, illegal, or superseded ordinances have been repealed as part of the codification. The Code has been adopted by the mayor and council through the enactment of a single ordinance and thus constitutes the general body of ordinance enactments of the city. 
The Code includes several features that will facilitate its use. The various chapters and articles of the Code follow one another in a natural, logical order. The table of contents, with a complete outline of this order, will often provide sufficient reference points for the reader. In addition, the reader may consult the index at the end of the volume. At the beginning of each chapter there is a section by section analysis of articles within the chapter. 
Nontextual provisions such as severability clauses, repeals, and enacting clauses are omitted from the text but are covered in Part 1 of this Code that applies to the entire Code of Ordinances. In most instances, references to "this ordinance" in the text of an ordinance have been changed to "this chapter" or "this article" as deemed appropriate. Various editorial notes such as state law references and cross references have been included throughout the code to clarify its provisions. 
This Code is designed to serve as a complete compilation of ordinances and as a reliable reference guide. The citations included at the end of sections refer to the official source and date of former Code sections and original ordinances. Sections of the Code which do not have a citation represent new ordinances that have been added to fill in gaps or to replace ordinances which have become outdated. 
Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida, will publish supplements to keep the Code current. Supplements are printed in looseleaf form so that all new ordinances may be inserted in the Code on a regular basis. 
We gratefully acknowledge the cooperation and assistance rendered by the municipal officials in the preparation of this Code.

SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code and are considered "Included." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code and are considered "Omitted." 
In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution. 

 
DIVISION I. - CHARTER AND RELATED LOCAL LAWS 
Act No. 174 of the 2007 Georgia General Assembly, signed by the governor on May 18, 2007, enacted a new charter for the City of East Point. Sections of the charter subsequently amended carry a legislative history in parentheses at the end of the affected section(s) denoting the amending legislation. The previous charter of the city derived from Ga. L. 1972, p. 2151, as amended. 
Division I of this code is a compilation of the city charter and related state laws of local application involving the city adopted by the Georgia General Assembly or adopted under home rule by the city along with state constitutional amendments of local application to the city. No state laws of general application are reprinted here but references to those laws are occasionally included in appropriate places. Local acts clearly superseded by general law have been excluded. 
The material included in this division has been arranged by basic acts or according to subject matter. The title, enactment, severability, repealer, transitional, ratification, publication and effective date provisions have been omitted, and where a section has been amended or repealed by a later provision, only the current language has been printed. Any material in brackets has been added to clarify the meaning of the text. At the end of each section appears a reference to the basic act and amendatory acts, if any. The editor has added section numbers and catchlines to facilitate the use of this compilation and indexing; however, formal citations and references should be to the original act, and not to this compilation. 
Included in this code is a State Laws of Local Application Disposition Table listing chronologically the laws in this division and their location in this code.

(a)  Regular meetings of the city council shall be held at such time and place within the city as the city council shall fix by ordinance. Special meetings of the city council may be held on the call of the mayor and two councilmembers or on the call of three councilmembers. Notice of such special meetings shall be served on all other members personally, or by telephone personally, at least 48 hours in advance of the meeting. Such notice of any special meeting may be waived by a councilmember in writing before or after such a meeting, and attendance shall also constitute a waiver of notice of any business transacted in such councilmember's presence, unless such councilmember attends for the express purpose of objecting to the legality of the notice provided for the meeting and refuses to participate based upon such objection. In the event of an objection regarding the legality of the notice for the special meeting, the city attorney shall make the determination as to whether notice was properly given. Only the business stated in the call may be transacted at the special meeting. 
(b)  The mayor, as presiding officer of the city council, shall have the authority to cancel a meeting of the city council on the grounds of an emergency. Notice of such cancellation shall be served on all councilmembers personally, or by telephone personally, as soon as practical after the emergency event.

Such notice to members shall not be required as to any member who is present when the emergency becomes apparent. Notice to the public shall be made as soon as is reasonably possible in accordance with Code Section 50-14-1 of the O.C.G.A. or such other applicable laws as are or may hereafter be enacted. 
Sec. 2-202. - Investigations and inquiries.

Any person who fails or refuses to obey a lawful order issued by the city council in the exercise of these powers shall be punished as provided by ordinance. The initiation and conduct of any investigations or inquiries by the city council under this charter provision shall not be deemed to constitute interference by the city council with the administration of the government by the city manager. 
Sec. 2-203. - Emergencies. 
(a)  To meet a public emergency affecting life, health, property, or public peace, the city council may convene on call of the mayor or two councilmembers and promptly adopt an emergency ordinance, but such ordinance may not levy taxes; grant, renew, or extend a franchise; regulate the rate charged by any public utility for its services; or authorize the borrowing of money except for loans to be repaid within 30 days. An emergency ordinance shall be introduced in the form prescribed for ordinances generally, except that it shall be plainly designated as an emergency ordinance and shall contain, after the enacting clause, a declaration stating that an emergency exists and describing the emergency in clear and specific terms. An emergency ordinance may be adopted, with or without amendment, or rejected at the meeting at which it is introduced, but the affirmative vote of at least three councilmembers shall be required for adoption. It shall become effective upon adoption or at such later time as it may specify. Every emergency ordinance shall automatically stand repealed 30 days following the date upon which it was adopted, but this shall not prevent reenactment of the ordinance in the manner specified in this section if the emergency still exists. An emergency ordinance may also be repealed by adoption of a repealing ordinance in the same manner specified in this section for adoption of emergency ordinances. 
(b)  Such meetings shall be open to the public to the extent required by law, and notice to the public of emergency meetings shall be made as fully as is reasonably possible in accordance with Code Section 50-14-1 of the O.C.G.A. or such other applicable laws as are or may hereafter be enacted.

The mayor or any councilmember may, at any time, question the city attorney as to procedural matters governing the meetings of council. The mayor may designate a police officer of the city to serve as sergeant at arms for the express purpose of maintaining the decorum or order at meetings of city council; however, it will remain within the sole discretion of the presiding officer to rule a councilmember out of order. 
Sec. 2-205. - Decorum. 
It is the intent of this charter provision to encourage decorum, civility, and respect in city council debate. Towards that end, councilmembers shall aspire to the following standards of decorum: 
(1)  In legislative debate, councilmembers shall, to the maximum extent possible, keep their remarks germane to the matter before the city council at that time; and 
(2)  Councilmembers shall refrain from attacking the motives and character of other councilmembers participating in the debate. 
It is not the intent of this provision to, in any way, hinder or impair the full and free expression of competing viewpoints in city council debate. Instead, it is the intent of this provision to foster citizen confidence in government through encouraging civil, respectful meetings. 
Sec. 2-206. - Quorum; voting. 
Five councilmembers and the mayor or six councilmembers shall constitute a quorum and shall be authorized to transact business of the city council. Voting on the adoption of ordinances shall be by voice vote and the vote shall be recorded in the journal or by voting machine and recorded thereby, but any member of the city council shall have the right to request a roll-call vote, and such vote shall be recorded in the journal. Except as otherwise provided in this charter, the affirmative vote of five councilmembers shall be required for the adoption of any ordinance, resolution, or motion. 
Sec. 2-207. - Form of legislation. 
(a)  Every official act of the city council having the force and effect of law shall be by ordinance. All other actions of the city council shall be by resolution.

(c)  No ordinance shall contain more than one subject matter, which subject shall be clearly expressed in the title of the ordinance. 
(d)  The enacting clause shall be "Be it ordained by the city council of East Point…". 
(e)  Any ordinance which repeals or amends an existing ordinance or part of the city code shall set forth the ordinance sections or subsections to be repealed or amended. 
(f)  An ordinance may be introduced by any councilmember at any regular meeting of the city council or at any special meeting at which an ordinance may be lawfully considered and adopted. 
(g)  Each ordinance shall be read by title at two different regular meetings of the city council unless such reading be waived by affirmative vote of no less than two-thirds (2/3) of the council members present at any meeting of the city council duly convened at which a quorum is present; provided, however, that any zoning ordinance, assessing ordinance, or any other ordinance requiring a public hearing shall not be finally adopted until after such ordinance has been properly advertised and a public hearing held thereon.

CHAPTER 4. - RELATIONSHIP AMONG MAYOR, CITY COUNCIL, AND CITY MANAGER. 

Sec. 2-401. - Role delineation. 
Based upon the firm belief that the proper, efficient, and effective administration and operation of the city's council-manager form of government will be fostered by a clear definition of the roles and responsibilities of the city council, mayor, and city manager, this charter provision states the following principles, which are intended to be fully consistent with this article: 
(1)  The full and complete legislative and policy making authority of the city resides in the city council, and the city manager shall take no action which impinges upon or interferes with the city council's policy making role. Other than providing information relevant and germane to the city council's legislative deliberations, the city manager shall strive to remain a neutral party in such legislative deliberations. To ensure the actuality and appearance of neutrality, neither the city manager nor any department heads shall participate in any political activity on behalf of the mayor, any councilmember, or any candidate for such offices, nor shall the city manager or any department head make any political contribution to the mayor, any councilmember, or any candidate for such offices. The mayor and councilmembers shall not solicit or accept any campaign contributions from any city employee; 
(2)  The city manager is the chief executive officer of the city, and, as such, all department heads, except the city attorney and city clerk who are appointed by and report to the city council, report to the city manager. The mayor and city council shall observe the management authority of the city manager. 
(A)  The mayor and councilmembers shall not in any manner dictate the appointment or removal of any city administrative officers or employees whom the city manager or any of his or her subordinates are empowered to appoint; 
(B)  Except for the purpose of conducting an investigation or inquiry authorized by the city council pursuant to Section 2-202 of this charter, the mayor and councilmembers shall deal with city officers and employees who are subject to the direction and supervision of the city manager solely through the city manager, and neither the mayor nor any councilmembers shall give orders to any such officers or employees either publicly or privately; 
(C)  The mayor and city council shall not give directives to any city officers or employees, other than the city manager, city attorney, and city clerk, regarding any matters including, but not limited to, constituent complaints and complaints regarding the services, operation, or administration of any department or function of city government. Although the mayor and city council shall not be prohibited from communicating with city officers or employees with constituent complaints or concerns, the city manager shall be copied on all such communications; 
(D)  The mayor and councilmembers, unless acting pursuant to a duly authorized investigation or inquiry, shall not discuss in open session the performance of or complaints against any city officer or employee during a city council meeting. This provision is not intended to prevent the mayor or city council from discussing, in general terms, the performance of or any issue relating to any department or function of city government; and 
(E)  It shall be prohibited for the mayor or any councilmember to sit in on personnel and management meetings between the city manager and city employees unless such participation is consented to by the city manager and approved by the city council; and 
(3)  The mayor shall have no management authority or responsibility with respect to the operations and administration of city government; and 
(4)  The mayor and city council, as elected officials, shall possess fundamental oversight duties and responsibilities with respect to all operations and administration of city government, and the city manager shall be responsible and duty bound to facilitate the mayor and city council's oversight function. Once the city council has passed the operating and capital budgets of the city, it shall be the responsibility of the city manager to administer such budgets and to keep the mayor and city council fully informed as to the city's progress against such budgets. The city manager shall provide monthly financial updates on the budgets with year to date information, and such updates shall contain all material information necessary for the mayor and city council to evaluate the financial performance and condition of the city. However, once the city council has appropriated funds in the budget and encumbered such funds through subsequent legislative action, the city manager shall have the authority to administer such budget including contract administration and account payables as part of the management function.

CHAPTER 4. - ETHICS POLICY[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 016-13, adopted July 1, 2013, repealed the former Ch. 4, §§ 2-4001—2-4030, and enacted a new Ch. 4 as set out herein. The former Ch. 4 pertained to the same subject matter. Refer to Code Comparative Table for complete derivation. 

Sec. 2-4001. - Declaration of policy. 
(a)  Our government is a representative democracy. Those who are elected, appointed, hired, volunteer, or campaign to serve the public as representatives accept a public trust, which they share with those whom they elect, appoint, hire or otherwise enlist to help them serve the public. The public entrusts its power and resources to its servants to use only in the public interest. Public trust requires public servants to fulfill their public duties faithfully and honestly, and to subordinate any personal interest which conflicts with the public interest. Public trust also requires that government be conducted in an open manner, when appropriate, so that the official actions of public servants may be subject to public scrutiny and so that members of the public have access to information upon which decisions and policies affecting them are made; but public trust also requires that government be conducted in a manner which respects the rights of its constituents to privacy and confidentiality. Public trust also requires that acts which are contrary to the public interest be defined and prohibited; that there be an orderly procedure for raising and addressing ethical questions; that ethical behavior be encouraged and suitably rewarded; and that unethical behavior be discouraged and suitably disciplined through a process which is fundamentally fair. 
(b)  It is the responsibility of each public servant to act in a manner which contributes to cultivating public trust in the integrity of government. Public trust in the integrity of government is cultivated when individual public servants act with integrity and when the public is aware that its servants act with integrity. Therefore, dedicated public servants not only act with integrity, but also choose to avoid even lawful activity when the appearance of impropriety would lessen the public's confidence in the integrity of its servants and its system. As a result, sometimes public servants sacrifice opportunities which would be open to them if they were not public servants. 
(c)  Most public servants strive to live by these standards most of the time, but because sometimes some do not, some formal policies are necessary. In adopting these formal policies, this community recognizes that: 
(1)  Public servants are also members of society and, therefore, share the same general personal and economic interests in the decisions and policies of government as all members of the community do; and 
(2)  Public servants retain their rights to publicly express their views on matters of general public interest, and to express their opinions on the effect of public actions on their personal or economic interests or rights; and 
(3)  It is sound public policy for standards of ethical conduct for public servants to distinguish between those minor and inconsequential conflicts that are unavoidable in a free society, and those conflicts which are personal, material and avoidable; and 
(4)  Public servants are entitled to engage in employment, professional or business activities, other than official duties, in order to support themselves and their families and to maintain a continuity of professional or business activity, and are entitled to maintain investments; and 
(5)  In this community it is possible and reasonable to require public servants to engage in employment, professional or business activities and to maintain investments which do not impede or undermine the integrity of their service to the community. 
(d)  Although this chapter is necessary to identify minimum standards below which a public servant's conduct cannot fall without the risk of penalty, it is understood that a healthy ethical environment for the provision of public service cannot be achieved or maintained by mere adherence to minimum standards. Therefore, this chapter also requires that the community provide additional, positive means of encouraging ethical behavior among its public servants. It is also understood that no external activity can replace the internal commitment which motivates those who act ethically. The principal policy which forms the foundation of this chapter is to encourage internal commitment by establishing and maintaining a work environment which supports integrity with pride and enthusiasm. 
(e)  A work environment which supports integrity includes public servants who: 
(1)  Recognize with gratitude that the primary reason they hold a public position is to serve the public; and 
(2)  Recognize with pride that they hold their public position because the public trusts them; and 
(3)  Recognize with sadness that the public's trust in government and in them is diminished when any public servant acts unethically; and 
(4)  Recognize with hope that their public service is an opportunity to help restore public trust in their government; and 
(5)  Are fair and impartial, but also courteous and enthusiastic in serving the public and each other in the performance of their duties; and 
(6)  Are adequately educated in the principles of ethics; and 
(7)  Are motivated to pursue ethical ideals which always exceed minimum standards and often achieve the highest standards; and 
(8)  Exemplify ethical conduct; and 
(9)  Encourage ethical practices which protect, advance and promote the public interest; and 
(10)  In speaking about the conduct of those in public service, or in responding to others who speak about it, express approval of positive ethical principles and behavior, and refrain from unjustly disparaging or demeaning those who advocate ethical principles or practice ethical behavior; and 
(11)  Recognize that the most effective way to eradicate unethical practices is to consistently act ethically themselves, and to consistently react appropriately with respect to the ethical decisions of those with whom they work; and 
(12)  Exercise sound and independent judgment to act ethically in situations where others around them may be inclined to act unethically; and 
(13)  When they observe serious unethical practices, promptly disclose them to appropriate authorities, and encourage others to do the same; and 
(14)  Make and implement decisions and policies through proper channels of the governmental organization; and 
(15)  Insure that those for whose performance they are responsible are aware of minimum standards of ethics below which their conduct cannot fall without the risk of disciplinary consequences; and 
(16)  When unethical behavior has been determined by the board, they will make the appropriate recommendation to the appropriate legal authority and the mayor and council. 
(Ord. No. 016-13, 7-1-13) 
Sec. 2-4002. - Purposes of chapter.

(a)  To state principles of ethics which are to be applied in public service; and

(d)  To encourage public servants to pursue the highest ethical ideals which they can achieve; and

(f)  To provide an objective and fair process to identify and resolve ethical issues; and 
(g)  To inform public servants and the public of the minimum standards to which public servants must adhere; and

(k)  To provide for a just and reasonable balance among the rights of all individuals who are directly affected by the operation of this chapter.

(Ord. No. 016-13, 7-1-13) 
Sec. 2-4006. - Duties. 
(a)  All public servants must conduct themselves in a manner that is above reproach and avoids even the appearance of impropriety. 
(b)  No public servant or former public servant shall divulge to any unauthorized person confidential information acquired in the course of holding his or her position in advance of the time prescribed by the governing body, administrators, or other applicable law for its release to the public. This includes information acquired that is subject to the attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product doctrine. 
(c)  All public servants shall respond fully and truthfully to any inquiries by the board in connection with the investigation of an alleged or potential violation of this chapter or the Charter. All public servants shall cooperate fully in any investigation by the board, and shall locate, compile and produce for them such information as they may request, unless the information requested is exempt from disclosure under other applicable law. 
(d)  All public servants have an affirmative duty to report any ethical violations of this chapter or the Charter of which they have knowledge. Any person may report a violation of this chapter by filing an ethics complaint against any person other than a paid employee on the proscribed form with the city clerk, who shall convene an ethics panel for processing of such report. 
(e)  Duty to comply with the law. All public servants shall comply with the Constitution and laws of the United States, the Constitution and laws of the State of Georgia, and the Charter and ordinances of the city in the performance of their public duties. In addition to being a violation of other laws, it is also a violation of this chapter for any public servant to: 
(1)  Be convicted of any felony or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, as that term may be defined by state law, whether or not the crime relates directly to the duties of the public servant's position in public service; or

(5)  Be found guilty of violating any state laws governing lobbying activities conducted by the public servant; or 
(6)  Be found guilty of violating the city's policy prohibiting the possession or consumption by employees of alcohol or any controlled or illegal substance in any city facility, vehicle, or work site, including lunch periods and rest breaks; prohibiting public servants from driving or reporting to work, performing work, or visiting a work site while under the influence of alcohol or any controlled or illegal substance; prohibiting public servants from engaging in the consumption, possession, sale, purchase or transfer of controlled substances; and imposing a duty to provide proof of lawful prescription when requested; to advise a supervisor if the use of prescription drugs may affect a public servant's ability to perform public duties safely and efficiently; or 
(7)  Be found guilty of violating any federal, state or city laws or policies regulating political activity; or 
(8)  Be convicted of habitual violations of other federal, state and local laws. Public servants have an ethical duty to abide by the general laws of the state and city, such as the laws governing driving under the influence, the uniform rules of the road, and offenses involving moral turpitude. Habitual violations of state and city laws may indicate disrespect for the law and may contribute to the erosion of public trust. 
a.  If any person believes that a public servant has been convicted of habitual violations of state, federal, or local laws, and that those convictions contribute to the erosion of public trust, that person may file a written complaint with the city clerk, setting forth the facts upon which the complaint is based. The clerk shall forward a copy of the complaint to the alleged offender and the selected three (3) member panel; and if the panel, in its discretion, decides to hear the complaint, it shall give the person notice and an opportunity to be heard. In the event the panel finds that the alleged offender is guilty of habitual violations of law and that the violations contribute to the erosion of public trust, the panel shall have no power other than to inform the offender and city council of the panel's findings, which may subject the offender to further disciplinary action. Having received such notice, the offender shall violate this chapter if the offender violates the order of the board. 
b.  In addition, the governing body, or city manager, where applicable, acting with the authorization of the governing body, may adopt a policy more precisely describing this general duty of all public servants to comply with specified laws in order to help gain and retain respect for city government. The policy must inform public servants of the circumstances under which, and the procedures by means of which, violations of state and city laws will be deemed violations of the policy. The procedures adopted in connection with the policy must safeguard the Constitutional rights of the public servants who are subject to the policy, including the rights of notice and a hearing. If the city adopts a general policy, public servants have a duty to adhere to that policy. If they fail to do so, and thereafter, in accordance with the procedures established by the policy, are determined to have violated the policy, the violation of the policy by the public servants shall also constitute a violation of this provision of this chapter.

(c)  No public servant shall accept or receive, directly or indirectly, from any person, including one whose identity is unknown to the public servant, any personal benefit under circumstances in which it can reasonably be inferred that the benefit is intended to influence the public servant in the performance or nonperformance of any official duty or as a reward for any official action of the public servant.

(1)  Prohibit the disclosure of any such information to incumbent public servants to whose duties the information may be pertinent; or 
(2)  Prevent any public servant from reporting violations of this chapter, the Charter or other illegal acts to the proper authorities; or

(a)  A governing body member who has or may have, a conflict of interest in a matter which requires an official action by any decision maker, shall, before the matter is decided, disclose the conflict of interest or the potential or alleged conflict of interest; if the member of the governing body believes that no conflict of interest exists, or that despite any alleged or potential special interest, such governing body member is nevertheless able to vote and otherwise participate fairly, objectively and in a manner consistent with the public interest, then the member shall so state in the written disclosure.

If the ethics panel or board determines that the attorney has a personal interest in the matter, or if the city attorney determines that the city attorney's office cannot resolve the conflict in a manner which will allow the city attorney's office to perform its duties properly in the matter, another attorney shall be selected by the city attorney to assist ethics panel.

(f)  Record of hearing. A certified court reported shall be engaged by the city to provide a take-down of all hearings; however, the recording of a hearing shall not be transcribed unless approved by the city manager. If the transcription is so made pursuant to a request by either party in the hearing, the cost thereof shall be borne by the party making the request.

(Ord. No. 010-08, § 3, 3-17-08) 
Sec. 4-1019. - Decision of hearing officer/panel. 
(a)  Requirements of decision. As part of the final decision, the hearing officer/panel shall include findings of fact and any law on which the decision is based, separately stated, and the effective date of the decision or order.

(c)  Relief of employee. If the decision of the hearing officer/panel is in favor of the employee on appeals of dismissal, suspension or demotion, the employee shall be reinstated in accordance with the decision to the classification from which the employee was removed. The effective date of the reinstatement shall be the date immediately following the effective date of the appealed action as if there had been no break in service, unless otherwise specified in the order. The employee shall be entitled to the same salary, with any increments in the position or salary which would have automatically inured to the employee if the employee had remained in actual service. The employee shall receive payment as if there had been no break in service, minus any amount earned by or paid to the employee from other employment and wage substitutions, including but not limited to unemployment compensation, during the period off the job and minus any amount paid the employee for annual leave. Sick and annual leave shall be restored to the employee in the same amount that existed at the time of the appealed action, plus sick and annual leave that would have been earned for the period if the employee had actually been in service. However, any period of postponement or continuance of the hearing for the convenience of the employee shall be excluded from any payment of benefits due, and this period of time shall be considered as if the employee had been on leave without pay. Prior to any payment to the employee, the employee shall certify under oath the amount of any income received from other employment and any wage substitutes received during the period off the job, which shall be deducted from the backpay owed by the city. 
(d)  The decision of the hearing officer/panel under this division shall not limit the right of either party to judicial review, and such decision shall be stayed by the filing of a petition for review. Any party, including the city or any city department, who has exhausted all administrative remedies available before the board and who is aggrieved by a final decision or order of the board on any hearing may seek judicial review of the final decision or order of the board in the superior court of Fulton County by writ of certiorari.

Upon such termination or discontinuance, there shall be set aside in a separate account an amount estimated by the board to be adequate to defray all costs and charges (including those of legal counsel, actuary, and trustee) associated with the plan termination. From the trust fund remaining, the amount of the accrued retirement benefits shall be deemed to have been funded in the following order of priorities: 
(1)  All participants' contributions with interest payable under the plan to the date of termination of the plan. 
(2)  All participants who, prior to the termination of the plan, have retired or died or have elected phased retirement, and who, or their beneficiaries, are already receiving benefits and participants who are continuing employment under the delayed retirement provisions. 
(3)  All participants who, prior to termination of the plan, were eligible for early or normal but not delayed retirement benefits. 
(4)  All participants who, prior to termination of the plan, were one hundred (100) percent vested in their benefits. 
(5)  All remaining participants with accrued retirement benefits. 
(6)  All contingent beneficiaries entitled to death benefits only upon the deaths of participants who are living at the time the plan is terminated. 
Benefits payable under any of the items listed above shall be properly adjusted to reflect any benefits payable under any prior item. 
In the event the trust fund is insufficient to fully fund the accrued retirement benefits (to the date of such termination or discontinuance) for all participants in any class, then such accrued retirement benefits shall be deemed to have been funded in the proportion which the then actuarially determined present value of the accrued retirement benefits for each participant in such class bears to the then actuarially determined present value of the accrued retirement benefits for all participants in such class. 
(d)  Methods of satisfying obligations: Upon termination of the plan, the board shall determine, and so direct the trustee, the method, from among the following methods of discharging and satisfying all obligations (in the order of priorities specified above) on behalf of participants: 
(1)  By continuation of the trust and the payment therefrom of benefits as they become due in accordance with the provisions of the plan in effect immediately prior to its termination; or 
(2)  By annuities payable through the media of annuity contracts purchased from an insurance company; or 
(3)  By the liquidation and distribution of the assets of the trust fund; or 
(4)  By any combination of such methods. 
(e)  Repayment to employer: After the satisfaction of all liabilities under the plan, any overpayments made by the employer into the trust fund as a result of erroneous actuarial computations shall be repaid to the employer.

CODE 415 LIMITATIONS ON BENEFITS 

Sec. 4-1147. - Code 415 limitations on benefits attributable to employer contributions. 
(a)  Basic limitation on benefit. Notwithstanding any provision in the plan to the contrary and except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, the annual benefit payable to a participant under the plan and any other defined benefit plans maintained by an affiliate, to the extent attributable to employer contributions, shall not exceed the defined benefit dollar limitation. 
(b)  Exception. The limitations under subsection (a) shall not apply if the participant's annual benefit attributable to employer contributions under the plan or any other defined benefit plans maintained by an affiliate does not in the aggregate exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000). 
(c)  Adjustments to basic limitation. 
(1)  Adjustment for early retirement. If a participant's benefit under the plan commences before age sixty-two (62), the defined benefit dollar limitation applicable to the participant at such earlier age is an annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity beginning at the earlier age that is the actuarial equivalent of the defined benefit dollar limitation applicable to the participant at age (62) (adjusted under subsections (3) and/or (4) below, if required). The defined benefit dollar limitation applicable at an age prior to age sixty-two (62) is determined as the lesser of (i) the actuarial equivalent (at such age) of the defined benefit dollar limitation computed using the interest rate and mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in section 1.02 of the plan and (ii) the actuarial equivalent (at such age) of the defined benefit dollar limitation computed using a five-percent interest rate and the applicable mortality table as defined in section 1.02 of the plan. Any decrease in the defined benefit. 
Dollar limitation determined in accordance with this subsection (1) shall not reflect a mortality decrement if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the participant. If any benefits are forfeited upon death, the full mortality decrement is taken into account. 
To the extent allowed by the Internal Revenue Service, the above limitations do not apply to police officers and firefighters. 
(2)  Adjustment for deferred retirement. If a participant's benefit under the plan commences after age sixty-five (65), the defined benefit dollar limitation shall be adjusted (in the manner prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury) so that it is the actuarial equivalent (determined using the applicable interest rate and mortality table under Code Section 417 (e)(3)) of a benefit equal to the defined benefit dollar limitation commencing at age sixty-five (65). 
(3)  Adjustment for less than ten years credited service. If a participant has completed less than ten (10) years credited service the defined benefit dollar limitation shall be adjusted by multiplying it by a fraction, the numerator of which is the participant's number of years (or part thereof) of credited service and the denominator of which is ten (10). 
(4)  Adjustment for less than ten (10) years of vesting service. If a participant has completed less than ten (10) years of vesting service, the limitation referred to in subsection (a) and the exception described in subsection (b) shall be adjusted by multiplying the amounts described in such limitation and exception by a fraction, the numerator of which is the participant's number of years of service (or part thereof) and the denominator of which is ten (10).

For limitation years ending after December 31, 2001, the "defined benefit dollar limitation" shall mean one hundred sixty thousand dollars ($160,000.00), as adjusted, effective January 1 of each year, under Code Section 415(d) in such manner as the secretary shall prescribe, and payable in the form of a straight life annuity. A limitation as adjusted under Code Section 415(d) will apply to the first limitation year ending after December 31, 2001. 
(b)  Defined benefit plan. The term "defined benefit plan" shall mean any qualified retirement plan maintained by an affiliate, which is not a defined contribution plan.

Should the purchasing agent be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the firm considered to be the most qualified at a price the purchasing agent determines to be fair and reasonable to the city, negotiations with that firm shall be formally terminated. The purchasing agent shall then undertake negotiations with the second most qualified firm. Failing accord with the second most qualified firm, the purchasing agent shall undertake negotiations with the third most qualified firm.

(2)  Determination of nonresponsibility: If a bidder or offeror who otherwise would have been awarded a contract is found nonresponsible, a written determination of nonresponsibility setting forth the basis of the finding shall be prepared by the purchasing agent. The unreasonable failure of a bidder or offeror to supply prompt information in connection with an inquiry with respect to responsibility may be grounds for a determination of nonresponsibility. A copy of the determination shall be sent to the nonresponsible bidder or offeror. The final determination shall be made part of the contract file and be made a public record.

Sec. 4-5001. - Definitions. 
In this chapter: 
Mediation means a process whereby a neutral third person called a "mediator" acts to encourage and facilitate the resolution of a dispute between two (2) or more parties. It is an informal and nonadversarial process with the objective of helping the disputing parties reach a mutually acceptable and voluntary agreement. In mediation, decision-making authority rests with the parties. The role of the mediator includes, but is not limited to, assisting the parties in identifying issues, fostering joint problem-solving, and exploring settlement alternatives. 
(Ord. No. 1181-94, § 3, 7-18-94) 
Sec. 4-5002. - Policies. 
It is the policy of the city to encourage the peaceful resolution of disputes through the process of mediation. It is the opinion of the city that the increased utilization of the mediation process will result in tangible benefits to both the city itself as well as its citizenry, including but not limited to savings in actual monies spent on litigation as well as increased efficiencies in the operations of the city and the judicial system at large.

(b)  In addition, the city or its officials may on its own motion or the motion of a party, refer to mediation any matter whereby an aggrieved employee or third party asserts a claim against the city or any of its employees or officials. However, such referrals shall be made only in the sole discretion of the city and only with the consent of the aggrieved party and shall further be made in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Such claim shall be screened by the city either on its own or in cooperation with a mediator to determine whether the claim is appropriate for mediation. 
(Ord. No. 1181-94, § 3, 7-18-94) 
Sec. 4-5004. - Notification. 
(a)  All third-party claimants filing an action against the city shall be informed in writing of the existence of the City of East Point's mediation system by the mailing of a copy of this Chapter 5 to such address as is listed for said third-party claimant within the action filed. Furthermore, if the city determines that a third party's claim is appropriate for referral to mediation, the city shall notify the aggrieved party of its determination and shall actively encourage the third party to agree to submit the matter to mediation in accordance with the provisions of this Code. The notice letter shall contain a brief statement advising the aggrieved party that, in the event the matter is ultimately submitted to mediation, each party shall be responsible for the payment of one-half (½) of the costs associated with the mediators' services and that each party shall be solely responsible for their own attorney fees, if any, incurred in relation thereto. 
(b)  The aggrieved party may, at any time after its receipt of the notice under subsection 4-5004(a), notify the city in writing of its objection to the referral. 
(c)  In the event the third party objects to the referral, the city may not refer the dispute to mediation. In the event the third party agrees to submit the dispute to mediation, the city shall go forward with such submittal in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1181-94, § 3, 7-18-94)

(Ord. No. 1181-94, § 3, 7-18-94) 
Sec. 4-5007. - Standards and duties of mediator.

(b)  Unless expressly authorized by the disclosing party, the mediator may not disclose to either party information given in confidence by the other and shall at all times maintain confidentiality with respect to communications relating to the subject matter of the dispute. 
(Ord. No. 1181-94, § 3, 7-18-94) 
Sec. 4-5008. - Compensation of mediator. 
The city shall pay all fees associated with the services of a mediator appointed under sections 4-1012(b), 4-1070, section 4-1071(d) or section 4-1072 out of the general operating funds of the city. The city and the aggrieved third party shall each be responsible for the payment of one-half (½) of the fees associated with the services of any mediator appointed under section 4-5004(c) hereof.

(Ord. No. 1181-94, § 3, 7-18-94) 
Sec. 4-5009. - Effect of written agreement. 
If, through the mediation process, the parties reach a settlement and execute a written agreement disposing of the dispute, the agreement is enforceable in the same manner as any other written agreement. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, no agreement reached in any mediation shall be enforceable against the city unless and except such agreement has been approved by duly authorized city officials in the same manner as is provided for in this Code for the approval of other binding agreements with the city. 
(Ord. No. 1181-94, § 3, 7-18-94) 
Sec. 4-5010. - Confidentiality of communications in mediation. 
(a)  Unless the parties agree otherwise, all matters, including the conduct and demeanor of the parties and their counsel during a mediation, are confidential and may never be disclosed to anyone. 
(b)  Any statement made during a mediation or early neutral evaluation conference whether before or after the institution of formal judicial proceedings, is confidential, not subject to disclosure, and may not be used as evidence in any subsequent administrative or judicial proceeding. 
(c)  Any document or other evidence generated in connection with a mediation or case evaluation or early neutral evaluation is not subject to discovery.

Otherwise discoverable material is not rendered immune from discovery by use in a mediation or case evaluation or early neutral evaluation. 
(d)  Neither the neutral nor any observer present with permission of the parties in a mediation may be subpoenaed or otherwise required to testify concerning a mediation or case evaluation or early neutral evaluation conference in any subsequent administrative or judicial proceeding.

(e)  In his or her opening statement, the neutral should discuss any limitation on confidentiality imposed by any statutory duty to report information. 
(f)  Observation by neutral-trainees with the consent of the parties does not breach the confidentiality of a mediation or case evaluation or early neutral evaluation conference.

(Ord. No. 1181-94, § 3, 7-18-94)

CHAPTER 1. - TAXATION 
ARTICLE A. - PROPERTY TAX 

Sec. 5-1001. - Annual tax on real estate and tangible personal property. 
(a)  Generally. On January 1, each year there is hereby imposed upon all real estate, including buildings and improvements thereon in the city not exempt from taxation by law, which shall be assessed in accordance with the Charter, and also upon all tangible personal property held or owned by any person or otherwise, whether individually or as trustee, guardian, administrator, receiver, assignee, agent or otherwise, on the first day of January during the years in which this chapter is in force, and there is hereby levied a tax on every dollar of the taxable value thereof or less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) in value in proportion, for the respective years; and all persons who may have held or owned such property as above described on the first day of January during the years in which this chapter is in force shall, between the first day of January and the first day of April of such years make return to the department of administrative services of the city under oath of the full extent and amount of such real and personal property, and in default shall be subject to execution, levy, cost and penalties as provided in this Code and the City Charter applicable thereto. 
(b)  Annual tax on real estate and tangible personal property hereafter annexed. Within all areas annexed to the limits of the City of East Point after the effective date of this section, there shall be imposed upon all real estate, including buildings and improvements thereon in the newly annexed areas not exempt from taxation by law, which shall be assessed in accordance with the Charter and state law, and also upon all tangible personal property held or owned by any person or otherwise, whether individually or as trustee, guardian, administrator, receiver, assignee, agent or otherwise, on the first day of January in the years in which this section is in force, and there is hereby levied a tax on every dollar of the taxable value thereof or less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) in value in proportion, for the respective years according to the following classifications and percentages as hereinafter specified; and all persons who may have held or owned such property as above described on the first day of January during the years in which this section is in force shall, between the first day of January and the first day of April of such years, make return to the department of administrative services of the city under oath of the full extent and amount of such real and personal property, and in default shall be subject to execution, levy, cost and penalties as provided in this Code, the City Charter and state laws applicable thereto.

Such agricultural uses shall include but not necessarily be limited to planting, cultivation and growth of forests for timber, pulpwood and other forest products, dairy and beef cattle farm operations, planting, cultivation and harvesting of row crops and including growth, cultivation and harvesting of hay. Use for the purposes of mining or quarrying of any type is excluded from agricultural use for the purposes of this section. The predominant determination of this category shall be that the use and any and all products derived from such areas shall be a product of the land and earth upon which it is situated. The ancillary and incidental uses thereto shall include residence of the owner or operator and living quarters of support personnel, together with structures used directly in support of the predominant agricultural use. Such area, because of its rural and predominant agricultural use, shall require minimal police and fire services. This classification shall be deemed to be abandoned when any additional development inconsistent with its predominant agricultural use is undertaken as may be evidenced by the request or furnishing of any of the following utility services, including but not limited to sewage collection system, water distribution system, storm drainage system or additional read [road] installation. Any application for rezoning other than for agricultural use shall be prima facie evidence of abandonment of the agricultural use and service tax district.

3.  Commencing January 1 of the third year after annexation of any area within this classification, there shall be imposed thereon an ad valorem tax as above stated equivalent to forty (40) percent of the millage applicable to full service tax districts of the City of East Point. 
4.  Commencing January 1 of the fourth year after annexation of any area within this classification, there shall be imposed thereon an ad valorem tax as above stated equivalent to fifty (50) percent of the millage applicable to full service tax districts of the City of East Point, and continuing at this level from year to year thereafter until termination of the agricultural use and service tax district. 
(2)  Developmental use and service tax district. 
(a)  Defined. Developmental use and service tax district shall be any area annexed to the City of East Point which has been or becomes transitional from a predominant rural and agricultural use to development for residential, commercial or industrial usage. For the purposes of determining developmental classification, it shall be conclusively presumed to be developmental unless already in use for residential, commercial or industrial use when there is filed an application for rezoning for other than agricultural use, or utility services of water distribution, sewage collection, storm sewer drainage or street improvements are permitted and installed upon such property. 
(b)  Tax schedule. 
1.  For developmental use and service tax districts so defined upon annexation, the ad valorem tax assessment on such property shall be zero percentage of the city millage for the first year commencing on January 1 after its annexation.

The claim shall identify the taxpayer, specify the business location, the tax years for which refunds are claimed and the dates of payment for which the refund is claimed. The claim shall also include a summary statement of the grounds on which the taxpayer relies and shall specify the tax years and dates of payments to which such grounds apply. In the event that the taxpayer desires a conference or hearing before the planning and zoning director or his/her designee in connection with any claim for refund, the taxpayer shall so specify in writing at the time of filing the claim. The planning and zoning director or his/her designee shall grant a conference at a time of his/her convenience except in those cases where the city council must hear the claim. 
(2)  The date of filing shall be the date that the claim for refund is received by the planning and zoning director or his/her designee. In any case where the planning and zoning director or his/her designee does not make a refund for any or the entire amount claimed, or cause the refund claim to appear on the agenda city council, within one year of the date that the claim is received, the taxpayer may consider that the claim is denied. No claim shall be deemed approved by the failure of the planning and zoning director or his/her designee to make a decision on the claim or to failure of the claim to appear on the agenda of the city council. The planning and zoning director or his/her designee and the taxpayer may agree in writing to extend the one year period for processing of the claim and such action shall stay the presumption of denial until the written agreement expires. 
(3)  In cases of error, clerical or otherwise, the city council shall approve or disapprove the claim through a resolution which shall also be considered at least once at a meeting of the city council, prior to a final vote. In such cases where the taxpayer has requested a hearing before the governing authority, such hearing shall take place at said committee meeting. 
(c)  Further proceedings concerning the denial of refund claims shall be as provided in O.C.G.A. § 48-5-380 as it may be from time to time amended.

Sec. 12.4. "Blasting Permits and Bond Required for Blasting Before a permit to do blasting as required under section 12.3a(3) shall be issued, according to the rules and procedures delineated below: 
"BLASTING PERMITS. 
Any person, firm, corporation, partnership or contractor wishing to engage in the use of explosives or blasting within the limits of the City of East Point first obtain a permit therefor. 
PRELIMINARY PERMIT. 
For such preliminary blasting permit, anyone seeking same shall first post a bond or a certified copy of a liability insurance policy in the minimum amount of $50,000 property damage per individual per occurrence, $100,000 aggregate property damage per occurrence and $300,000 bodily injury per person per occurrence with an aggregate bodily injury of $300,000 per occurrence or in such additional amount as may be deemed necessary by the fire chief, said bond or insurance policy shall be in a form payable for any damages arising from such preliminary test explosions and all damages arising from subsequent blasting operations if the production blasting permit issues. 
Before commencing initial test explosions a survey shall be conducted of all structures (where permitted by owner) contiguous to the blasting area and also other structures possibly endangered, based on location and/or condition. Color photographs are to be taken of typical conditions in each structure to reflect its condition prior to blasting. All exposed structures shall be carefully protected from the effects of the blasts and all blasts shall be covered with blasting mats, dirt, heavy timbers or other suitable material. The blasting shall be done by experienced workmen. Any damage done shall be promptly repaired by the contractor at his own expense. All blasting supplies shall be stored in a manner approved by the State Fire Marshal and a watchman shall be stationed at all times at the place of the storage. 
Care shall be taken for the initial test explosions and all subsequent explosions to minimize ground vibrations with a maximum peak particle velocity, as measured at the nearest structure, not to exceed 2.0 inches per second. The over pressure (noise or concussion) shall be minimized and sufficient stemming and matting used to prevent over pressure in excess of 120 db. Precaution shall be taken to minimize flying rock and sufficient matting used to prevent rocks from striking any person or structure. 
The preliminary permit shall be issued for the purposes of making initial test explosions at which time vibration recording instruments shall be used on the initial test explosions, and all others deemed necessary to determine proper blasting procedures. These instruments shall be of the type which records on direct-reading tape the three (3) components of velocity. The analysis of these recordings are to be signed by a registered, professional engineer licensed in the State of Georgia. The tapes and all other recorded documentary information are to be filed with the Fire Department at the time of making application for the blasting permit. Blasting is not to be conducted which will produce a scale distance less than previously recorded for at least three (3) different explosions deemed to be safe. The scale distance is to be determined by the distance from the shot to the nearest structure subject to potential damage from ground vibrations. 
Overpressure (concussion) is to be recorded on a direct recording tape, preferably at the same recording as the vibration. The instrument used for measuring concussion shall be the type specifically designed for impact type overpressure from explosions. 
For initial test shots under the preliminary blasting permits, care shall be taken to assure that ground vibrations with a maximum peak particle velocity, as measured at the nearest structure, do not exceed 1.0 inches per second. 
In the initial testing phase of explosion or blasting operations, prior to instrumentation, a scale distance of fifty (50) for residential structures, and a scale distance of twenty-five (25) for commercial and engineered structures or Numerically greater may be used to determine the maximum charge weight per delay interval of seventeen milliseconds or greater. (NOTE: A commercial or engineered structure to qualify for the scaled distance limitation of twenty-five (25) under the above regulation is one in which the load bearing frame is of steel or reinforced concrete with no inclusions of wall or ceilings for residential type construction, i.e., plastic walls or ceilings supported by studs or joist or rafters of wood, commonly associated with what is commonly known as "carpenter construction." All scale distance and blasting shall conform with standards and formulations set forth in table 1, attached hereto. 
All blast testing vibration and seismographic equipment shall conform to the standards and procedures set forth in table 2, attached hereto and which is by reference incorporated herein and made a part hereof. 
For preliminary testing, blasting and all production blasting, records shall be maintained in conformance with the information required on Table 3, attached hereto and which is by reference incorporated herein and made a part hereof. 
All blasting, whether preliminary testing or production blasting, shall conform with the safety standards set forth on Table 4, attached hereto and which is by reference incorporated herein and made a part hereof. 
Upon completion of tests, blasting and after certification by an engineer, it shall be submitted to the Fire Department of the City of East Point for approval and issuance of a production blasting permit and setting of a bond and/or liability insurance policy. It is required before the issuance of a production blasting permit that said bond or certified copy of liability blasting insurance be filed with the Fire Chief of the City of East Point. Said bond or blasting liability insurance policy shall on its face become payable for payment for any damages arising from such permitted blasting. Upon furnishing of all of said items and establishment of the amount of the bond or blasting liability insurance policy, the Fire Chief of the City of East Point shall issue a production blasting permit." 
TABLE 1  DEFINITIONS 
1.  SCALED DISTANCE is defined as the product obtained by dividing the distance (in feet) to the nearest building structure by the square root of the weight of explosive per time delay in pounds. 
2.  BLASTER is any person who, engaging in a blasting operation decides hole size, spacing, or depth; decides total quantity of explosive; decides quantity of explosive in each hole; and/or decides timing delays to be used. Such person must be present when the charge is detonated and either physically detonates the charge or gives the order to detonate the charge. 
BLASTING STANDARDS 
A.  In all blasting operations, except as hereinafter otherwise provided, the maximum peak particle velocity of the ground motion in any direction shall not exceed two inches per second at the immediate location of any dwelling house, public building, school, church, commercial or institutional building. 
B.  This ground velocity limit is not construed to mean on property owned, leased, or contracted by the blaster or blaster's company or on property on which the owner gives a written waiver. 
C.  No two consecutive subcharges within any charge shall be separated by a time delay of less than seventeen milliseconds. 
D.  The standard table for the maximum charge per delay period shall be for distances greater than 300 feet generated by the following formula: 
W =( D / 50 ) 2 
Where W is the weight of explosive in lbs and D is the distance to the nearest dwelling house, public building, school, church, commercial or institutional building in feet. On sites where the City decides it necessary to comply with the provisions of the law this formula may be altered. 
E.  For the purpose of well shooting below 100 ft., the table shall be generated by the following formula: 
W =( D / 50 ) 3 
Where W is the total weight of explosives in the hole and D is the distance from the charge to the nearest dwelling house, public building, school, church, commercial institutional building. 
F.  If on a particular site the peak ground particle continuously exceeds ½ inch per second after a period of one (1) second following the maximum ground particle velocity, the City shall require the total time delay of blasting operations to be less than 200 milliseconds or the charge per delay be reduced so that this limit is complied with. 
G.  For distances less than 300 feet, the following table shall be used: 

 
Less than 5 feet the total charge should not exceed 1/8 lb. 
TABLE 2  TESTING EQUIPMENT 
A.  If a blaster decides that the table provided by the City is too conservative, or limiting, he may on 15 days notification to the Department of Mines and Minerals use seismograph measurements and increase the charge per delay period, provided the velocity of 2 inches per second limit is not violated. He must use the seismograph on every shot thereafter so long as the table is not being complied with. If the blaster decides to return to the use of the table, he may do so by notifying the department 15 days in advance. 
B.  If a blaster considers the table too limiting or too conservative, for his particular area, he may upon submission of seismograph reports, petition for a modified table for blasting operation at that particular site but in no case shall the department allow a table that would permit velocities above the 2 inch per second limit. 
C.  In making a seismograph determination of the velocity at a particular position, the following formula shall be used: 
V = V o D<inf>o</inf> / D 1.5 
Where V o is the maximum ground particle velocity at the seismograph, D o is the distance from the blast, and D is the distance from the blast to the position in question and in the same general direction. The distance D o may not be greater than D, and D cannot be more than five (5) times D o . This determined velocity at the site of any dwelling house, public building, school, church, commercial or institutional building shall not exceed the two (2) inches per second limit. 
D.  In seismic tests for compliance or petition, the analysis of seismic data shall be conducted by a completely independent company, one not related to the company performing the blasting or for whom the blasting is being performed, under the direction of a professional engineer registered in Georgia. 
E.  A direct reading velocity instrument shall be approved only if it has a frequency range of 5 cycles per second to 150 cycles per second or greater, a velocity range from zero to 2.0 in/sec. or greater, adheres to design criteria for portable seismographs as outlined in USBM RI-5708, USBM RI-6487. 
F.  Instruments of both the direct reading velocity type and the displacement type are approved for use as follows: 
(1)  Particle velocity reading may be calculated from results obtained by a displacement instrument or obtained from an approved direct reading velocity instrument in any blasting operation where all of the following conditions exist: 
(a)  Recording distance is over 200 feet from the blast; 
(b)  Scaled distance is numerically greater than 25; 
(c)  Frequency range is 40 cycles per second or less. 
(2)  A direct reading velocity instrument will be required in any blasting operation where all of the following conditions exist: 
(a)  Recording distance is less than 200 ft. from the blast; 
(b)  Scaled distance is numerically less than 50. 
(3)  A direct reading velocity instrument will be required in any blasting operation where all the following conditions exist: 
(a)  Recording distance is more than 200 ft. from the blast; 
(b)  Scaled distance is numerically less than 25. 
(4)  A direct reading velocity instrument will be required in any blasting operation where all of the following conditions exist: 
(a)  Recording distance is more than 200 ft. from the blast; 
(b)  Frequency range is in excess of 40 cycles per second. 
Scaled distance is defined as 
D;sub§\sub;- <sqrt / D ;W> 
Where D is the actual distance in feet and W is the weight of explosives in pounds per delay period of seventeen milliseconds or greater.

DIVISION 1. - INTRODUCTION 

Sec. 8-2401. - Findings. 
The city council of the City of East Point, Georgia makes the following findings: 
(a)  The professional engineering and financing analysis, prepared by experts for the city, properly assesses and defines the stormwater management problems, needs, goals, program priorities and funding sources of the city. 
(b)  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the corporate limits of East Point. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the corporate limits of East Point is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
(c)  The stormwater needs in the City of East Point include, but are not limited to, protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. Provision of stormwater management programs and facilities renders and/or results in both service and benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of East Point in a variety of ways as identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses. However, the service and benefit rendered or resulting from provision of stormwater management systems and facilities may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater systems and programs, and risk exposure. 
(d)  The City of East Point presently owns, operates, and provides regulatory control regarding certain stormwater management systems, which have been developed over many years and include features such as inlets, conduits, channels, swales, ditches, drainage easements, and other natural waterways. The future usefulness of the existing stormwater systems owned and/or operated and/or regulated by the city, and of additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities in East Point in concert with the management of other water resources in the city. In order to do so, the city must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program operating and capital investment needs. 
(e)  Given the problems, needs, goals, program priorities, and funding opportunities identified in the professional engineering and financing analyses, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater systems in East Point in concert with other water resource management programs. 
(f)  The city council recognizes that lack of maintenance of a stormwater management system creates adverse conditions to both private and public elements of the management and conveyance system and to properties that are dependent upon such conveyances for effective management of stormwater runoff. 
(g)  The city council finds, concludes and determines that a stormwater management utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly funding stormwater management services in the City of East Point and implementing all of the city's stormwater management-related ordinances. 
(h)  An equitable approach to funding stormwater management services and facilities can be provided by adopting a schedule of service charges upon properties that is related to the burden of stormwater control service requirements and costs posed by properties throughout the city. Such schedule of service charges can be complemented by other funding methods, which address specific needs, including but not limited to, allocations of special purpose local options sales taxes to stormwater drainage improvement projects. A service charge credit is an appropriate means of adjusting service charges in recognition that private stormwater systems and/or actions can effectively reduce or eliminate the burden of stormwater quantity and quality control service requirements and costs that a property or properties pose for the city. Impervious area is the most important factor influencing stormwater service requirements and costs posed by properties throughout the city, and therefore is an appropriate parameter for calculating stormwater service charges and associated credits. In addition, the value to the stormwater management utility of certain actions and practices performed by property owners and other stormwater management utility customers may be recognized by credits.

City of East Point Stormwater Management System shall consist of all rivers, streams, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, channels, ditches, swales, storm sewers, culverts, inlets, sidewalks, catch basins, pipes, head walls and other structures, natural or man-made, within the political boundaries of the City of East Point which control and/or convey stormwater in and through the city, but shall exclude such stormwater management systems which are located on private property or public property not owned by the City of East Point and for which there has been no public dedication to the city and for which operation, maintenance, and/or improvement responsibilities have not been accepted through action of the city council in writing. 
Credit shall mean a conditional reduction in the amount of a stormwater service charge to an individual property based on the provision and continuing presence of an effectively maintained and operational on-site stormwater system or facility or the provision of a service or activity by property owner, which system, facility, service, or activity reduces the stormwater management utility's cost of providing stormwater services and facilities. The basis of such credits, if granted, will be defined by a specific written agreement at the determination of the director, department of public works in accordance with the city's Stormwater Management Credit and Adjustment Manual approved by action of the mayor and city council. 
Customers of the stormwater management utility shall include all persons, properties, and entities served by and/or benefiting from the utility's acquisition, management, maintenance, extension, and improvement of the City of East Point Stormwater Management System and regulation of public and private stormwater systems, facilities, and activities related thereto, and persons, properties, and entities which will ultimately be served or benefited as a result of the stormwater management program. 
Detached dwelling unit shall mean developed land containing one structure which is not attached to another dwelling and which contains one or more bedrooms, with a bathroom and kitchen facilities, designed for occupancy by one (1) family. Detached dwelling units may include houses, manufactured homes, and mobile homes located on one or more individual lots or parcels of land. Developed land may be classified as a detached dwelling unit despite the presence of incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports, or small storage buildings, or the presence of a commercial use within the dwelling unit so long as such use does not result in additional impervious areas such as parking spaces, playgrounds, or structures or additions to the building which are used as offices, storage facilities, meeting rooms, classrooms, houses of worship, or similar non-residential uses. Detached dwelling unit shall not include developed land containing: structures used primarily for non-residential purposes, manufactured homes and mobile homes located within manufactured home or mobile home parks where the land is owned by others than the owners of the manufactured homes or mobile homes, or multiple dwelling unit residential properties. 
Developed land shall mean all real property altered from its natural state by grading, paving, compaction, construction of structures, impervious services, or drainage works so that hydrologic response of the property is changed from that which would occur in the natural undeveloped condition. 
Director, department of public works is the individual at East Point that has direct responsibility for the management of the City of East Point Stormwater Management System and the stormwater management utility. In the event that the Director is otherwise committed, a designee appointed by director will be responsible for activities as set forth in this article. 
Duplexes and triplexes shall mean developed land containing two (2) (duplex) or three (3) (triplex) attached residential dwelling units located on one (1) or more parcels of land. 
Hydrologic response of a property is the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from a property. It is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious area; the size, shape, topographic, vegetative, and geologic conditions of a property; antecedent moisture conditions; and groundwater conditions on a property. 
Impervious means not allowing the passage of water through the surface of the ground or ground covering or a substantial reduction in the capacity for water to pass through the surface of the ground or ground covering as it would under natural conditions. The following types of surfaces will be considered "impervious" for purposes of the stormwater management utility: the projected area of buildings; asphalt-, concrete-, brick-, or stone- paved areas; improved vehicular drives and parking areas; compacted gravel and soil surfaces; fabric or plastic coverings; and other surfaces that prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater into soil or that change the hydrologic response of the property that existed prior to development. 
Multiple dwelling unit residential properties shall mean developed land where on four (4) or more attached residential dwelling units are located and shall include, but not limited to, apartment houses, condominiums, townhomes, attached single-family homes, and other structures in which four or more family groups commonly and normally reside or could reside. 
Other developed land shall mean, but shall not be limited to, commercial and office buildings, public buildings and structures, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces, parking lots, parks, recreation properties, public and private schools and universities, research stations, hospitals and convalescent centers, airports, churches and agricultural uses covered by impervious surfaces, water reservoirs, and water and wastewater treatment plants. 
Service charges shall mean the periodic rate, fee, or charge applicable to a parcel of land, which charge shall be reflective of the service provided by the City of East Point Stormwater Management Utility. Service charges are based on measurable parameters that influence the stormwater management utility's cost of providing services and facilities, with the most important factor being the amount of impervious area on each parcel of land. The use of impervious area as a service charge rate parameter shall not preclude the use of other parameters, or the grouping of properties having similar characteristics through the use of ranges or rounding up or down to a consistent numerical interval, or the use of flat-rate charges for one (1) or more classes of similarly-situated properties whose impact on the stormwater management utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities is relatively consistent. Stormwater service charges may also include special charges to the owners of particular properties for services or facilities uniquely related to stormwater management of that property, including but not limited to charges for development plan review, inspection of development projects and on-site stormwater control systems, and enhanced level of stormwater services above those normally provided by the city. 
Single family unit (SFU) is defined to serve as a reference point for comparing dissimilar properties and attaining an equitable distribution of the cost of services and facilities through a stormwater service fee. The SFU in East Point shall be determined through engineering and analysis, subject to approval by the city council. This unit shall be expressed in terms of square feet of impervious area, and will be used to determine and compute the service charge for all developed properties within East Point. 
Stormwater management systems shall include the City of East Point Stormwater Management System and private systems consisting of facilities, operations, and programs that address the issues of drainage management (flooding) and environmental quality (pollution, erosion and sedimentation) of stormwater runoff and receiving rivers, streams, creeks, lakes, ponds, and reservoirs through improvements, maintenance, regulation and funding of plants, works, instrumentalities and properties used or useful in the collection, retention, detention, and treatment of stormwater or surface water drainage. This definition is not intended to supersede more specific definitions that may be found in other stormwater management ordinances in the city's Code of Ordinances, wherein the term's definition is varied in accordance with its use in a particular context. 
Undeveloped land is land in its unaltered natural state or which has been modified to such minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural state. Undeveloped land shall have no pavement, asphalt, or compacted gravel surfaces or structures which create an impervious surface that would prevent infiltration of stormwater or cause stormwater to collect, concentrate, or flow in a manner materially different than that which would occur if the land was in an unaltered natural state.

Sec. 8-2421. - Declaration of public nuisance with regard to privately owned stormwater conveyance systems. 
Lack of maintenance of a stormwater management system located on private property creates adverse conditions impacting other private and public properties which are dependent upon these systems for stormwater runoff. The city recognizes that stormwater management systems on private property and private easements which are in neglected condition, with excessive vegetation or blocked pipes, ditches, swales or other conveyances, impede stormwater flow and cause adverse impacts to adjacent and upstream public and private property. The city finds that private stormwater management systems which are not adequately maintained, are collapsing, or otherwise impede or block the flow of stormwater constitute a public nuisance and a threat to public health, safety, and welfare. The city further finds that prompt abatement of inadequate maintenance of such private stormwater management systems is in the public interest. Any blocked conveyance condition or other condition that otherwise impedes or prevents a normal flow or design flow of stormwater into, through, or out of a private stormwater management system and which may cause flooding of other properties, public or private, is hereby declared to be a public nuisance and is prohibited. Ditches and swales which are determined to contain excessive vegetation and which may cause flooding of other properties, public or private, are hereby declared to be a public nuisance and are prohibited. Failure of property owners and developers of real property within the city to provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, discharge stormwater in a safe manner and in accordance with this article shall constitute a nuisance. A determination that such a condition exists shall be made by the director, department of public works or his designee. 
(Ord. No. 018-12, § 1, 12-19-12) 
Sec. 8-2422. - Inspections. 
(a)  Right of entry. The city shall have the right, pursuant to the authority of this article, for its designated officers and employees, bearing proper credentials and identification, to enter upon private and public property owned by entities other than the city, upon reasonable notice to the owner thereof, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests, including sample collection using state-approved test methodologies, thereon in order to assure compliance with this article. Inspections may be made as part of a neutral inspection scheme or if reasonable cause exists for such inspection(s). 
(b)  No creation of duty. No affirmative obligation shall exist, nor should one be construed to be created, to address all drainage failures or other malfunctions of the City of East Point Stormwater Management System, whether discovered through an inspection or otherwise. The mayor and city council retain sole discretion to determine if the costs to the city for such repair are justified by a corresponding benefit to the public. 
(Ord. No. 018-12, § 1, 12-19-12) 
Sec. 8-2423. - Violations, enforcement and penalties. 
(a)  Violations. Any action or inaction which violates the provisions of this article may be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this section. Any such action or inaction which is continuous with respect to time is deemed to be a public nuisance and may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief. The imposition of any of the penalties described below shall not prevent such equitable relief. 
(b)  Notice of violation. Whenever the director, department of public works finds that a violation of this ordinance has occurred, the director, department of public works may order compliance by written notice of violation. 
(1)  The notice of violation shall contain:

(3)  Notice, as required under this provision, shall not be required: 
a.  When the director, department of public works determines that the public nuisance presents an imminent endangerment to persons or property; or 
b.  When a notice of violation has been sent to the same property owner or owners for the same violation within the previous three (3) months; or 
c.  When notice by certified mail cannot be effected on the owners of record. 
(c)  Penalties. In the event the remedial measures described in the notice of violation have not been completed by the date set forth for such completion in the notice of violation, any one (1) or more of the following actions or penalties may be taken or assessed against the person to whom the notice of violation was directed in accordance with this section. Before taking any of the following actions or imposing any of the following penalties, the director, department of public works shall notify the owner of the property and/or other alleged violator in writing of its intended action, and shall provide a reasonable opportunity, of not less than ten (10) days (except that in the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or public safety, twenty-four (24) hours notice shall be sufficient) to cure such violation. In the event the property owner or other alleged violator fails to cure such violation after such notice and cure period, the director, department of public works may take any one (1) or more of the following actions or impose any one (1) or more of the following penalties. 
(1)  Abatement by the city. 
a.  If the director, department of public works concludes that abatement is necessary or appropriate, then representatives of the director, department of public works may enter upon the subject private property and are authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property as well as those adjacent to, upstream, or downstream from the site of noncompliance that have been adversely impacted by such noncompliance. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner, agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the government agency or designated contractor to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth above. 
b.  Within thirty (30) days after abatement of the violation, the owner of the property shall be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. If the amount due is not paid within thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice, the charges shall become a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment. 
(2)  Civil penalties. In the event the alleged violator fails to take the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or otherwise fails to cure the violations described therein within ten days (or such greater period as the director, department of public works shall deem appropriate) (except that in the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or public safety, twenty-four (24) hours notice shall be sufficient), the director, department of public works may impose a penalty not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) (depending on the severity of the violation) for each day the violation remains unremedied after receipt of the notice of violation. 
(3)  Criminal penalties. For intentional and flagrant violations of this article, the director, department of public works may issue a citation to the alleged violator requiring such person to appear in municipal court to answer charges for such violation. Upon conviction, such person shall be punished by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisonment for sixty (60) days or both. Each act of violation and each day upon which any violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. 
(d)  Remedies not exclusive. The remedies listed in this article are not exclusive of any other remedies available under any applicable federal, state or local law and the director, department of public works may seek cumulative remedies. 
(e)  Attorneys' fees and other costs. The director, department of public works may recover attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement of this article, including sampling and monitoring expenses.

Sec. 8-2430. - Storm drain repair/extension program. 
(a)  Any citizen of the city alleging that his property is being damaged by the collection, concentration, or flow of surface waters may file in writing with the director, department of public works, a brief statement setting forth the name, address, and telephone number of the property owner; the location of the property where the problem is alleged to exist; and the nature and probable cause of the alleged damage to the property. 
(b)  Upon receipt of the statement as set forth in subsection 8-2430(a), the director, department of public works, in coordination with the city attorney, shall cause an investigation to be made to determine the amount and origin of surface waters contributing to the claimant's alleged damage and also as to the effect of the collection and discharge of water from city property, which may contribute to the claimant's alleged damage. The director, department of public works, in coordination with the city attorney, shall then determine, in their best professional judgment, the percentage of damage, if any, which may have been caused by the flow of surface waters from city property. If the director, department of public works determines that the city may be contributing to the claimant's damage, he shall then estimate the cost of material and expenses required to correct the claimant's drainage problem. The findings of the director, department of public works shall then be forwarded to the city manager for resolution. 
(c)  In the event that the city manager determines from all available facts, including the report of the director, department of public works, the city attorney, and the statement filed by the claimant, that the collection and discharge of water from city property may be contributing or may have contributed to the claimant's damage, the city manager may recommend to city council for consideration and, upon approval by city council, the city may offer to participate with the property owner in the improvement of the drainage area solely as an offer of compromise and settlement.

DIVISION 5. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY 

Sec. 8-2450. - Establishment of a utility and enterprise fund. 
(a)  There is hereby established a stormwater management utility in the City of East Point to provide for stormwater management throughout the city's corporate limits, and provide for the management, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater management systems in accordance with the scope of responsibility for stormwater management within the City of East Point set forth in section 8-2410 of this article. Such utility shall be under the direction of the public works department. 
(b)  The city manager and finance director shall establish a stormwater enterprise fund in the city budget and accounting system, separate and apart from its general fund, for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the utility, including but not limited to rentals, rates, charges, fees, and licenses as may be established by the city council. All revenues and receipts of the stormwater management utility shall be deposited promptly upon receipt into the stormwater enterprise fund, to be held and invested in trust for the purposes dedicated, and allocated and expended as provided in subsection 8-2450(c). No other funds of the city shall be deposited in the stormwater enterprise fund or commingled with dedicated stormwater revenues, except that other revenues, receipts, and resources not accounted for in the stormwater enterprise fund, including, but not limited to, grants, transfers of city funds, loans, and bond proceeds may be combined with and applied to stormwater management capital projects as deemed appropriate by the city council, upon recommendation of the city manager. 
(c)  Forty (40) percent of the revenues and receipts of the stormwater management utility enterprise fund shall be used for bond debt service, to the extent the city has outstanding debt associated with stormwater infrastructure or other stormwater management programs. The remaining sixty (60) percent of the enterprise fund shall be used to fund stormwater management programs as specified in Division 4 of this article and cost associated with administration of the stormwater utility itself. 
(d)  The city council hereby transfers to the public works department operational control over the City of East Point Stormwater Management System and other related assets, including but not limited to properties upon which stormwater management system components are located, easements, rights-of-entry and access, and certain equipment. 
(e)  The city council hereby authorizes the establishment of a citizen stormwater utility advisory group. Each council member and the mayor shall select one member of the advisory group. 
(Ord. No. 018-12, § 1, 12-19-12) 
Sec. 8-2451. - Funding policy. 
(a)  It shall be the policy of the city that funding for the stormwater management utility is equitably derived through methods that have demonstrable relationships to the varied demands and costs imposed on the stormwater systems and programs and/or the level of service provided as a result of the provision of stormwater services and facilities by the city. 
(b)  Service charges for stormwater management shall be fair and reasonable and shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing services and facilities. The cost of stormwater management services and facilities may include, without limitation, administrative, operating, capital investment, debt service, engineering and planning, and reserve expenses, and may also include related regulatory expenses associated with stormwater-related watershed management requirements. Properties shall be charged rentals, rates, charges, fees, or licenses in proportion to their related cost of service impact. 
(c)  Service charge rates shall be designed to be consistent and coordinated with the use of other funding methods employed for stormwater management by the city, whether within or outside the stormwater management utility, including but not limited to plan review and inspection fees, special fees for services, fees in-lieu of regulatory requirements, impact fees, system development charges, and special assessments. 
(Ord. No. 018-12, § 1, 12-19-12) 
Sec. 8-2452. - Effective date of stormwater charges. 
Stormwater service charges shall accrue beginning at such time deemed appropriate by the city council and mayor, and shall be billed periodically thereafter to customers. 
(Ord. No. 018-12, § 1, 12-19-12) 
Sec. 8-2453. - Stormwater management utility service charges. 
(a)  There are hereby established stormwater management utility service charges that shall be billed to all developed properties in the East Point service area, except as specific exemptions or credits may allow for in this article or shall allow in future ordinances or amendments to this article. The stormwater management utility service charges may, but are not required to, include a service rate charge applied to each such property. 
(b)  The service rate charge, if applied, shall reflect the cost of providing services and facilities to properly control stormwater runoff quantity and quality. The most important factor in the city's present cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities to individual properties is the amount of impervious area on each property. 
(c)  Special service charges, if applied, shall be structured to recover the cost of providing to certain persons, entities, and properties types or levels of stormwater management services that are not commonly provided to all stormwater service charge ratepayers. Such services may include, but are not limited to, private development plan review and inspection, site inspections to verify the operational condition of on-site stormwater management systems, such as private detention/retention and conveyance facilities, monitoring and mitigate activities related to conditions on individual properties that impact water quality, and actions to abate conditions on private properties that do not comply with adopted city standards and/or that interfere with proper stormwater management and have been determined to constitute a public nuisance. 
(d)  The professional engineering and management analysis conducted for the city determined that properties within the city service area, regardless of classification, could be equitably and fairly charged a service fee based on a single family unit (SFU). An SFU is three thousand two hundred (3,200) square feet, which is the mean amount of impervious surface area for a typical detached residential dwelling unit in the City of East Point. 
(e)  The following service fees are hereby established and imposed for developed parcels of real property within the city service area: 
(1)  Single-family residential properties. The service fee for each parcel having one detached residential dwelling unit shall be based on a SFU rate of nine dollars and fifteen cents ($9.15) per month. Depending on the relative size of the dwelling unit's impervious surface area, adjustment factors shall be as follows: 
(i)  A small single family detached residence shall have an adjustment factor of 0.55. Statistical sampling shows that the impervious area of a small single family detached residence in the City of East Point is less than one thousand seven hundred sixty-nine (1,769) sq. ft. 
(ii)  The typical single-family detached residence shall not have an adjustment factor (the typical single-family detached residence is treated as 1.0 SFU). Statistical sampling shows that the impervious area of a typical single family detached residence in the City of East Point ranges from one thousand seven hundred sixty-nine (1,769) sq. ft. to four thousand seven hundred thirty-five (4,735) sq. ft. 
(iii)  A large single-family residence shall have an adjustment factor of 1.48. Statistical sampling shows that the impervious area of a large single-family detached residence is greater than four thousand seven hundred thirty-five (4,735) sq. ft. 
(2)  Other residential properties. The monthly service fee for other residential properties including apartments, condominiums, duplexes, triplexes, multifamily housing, mobile homes, and townhomes, shall be the SFU rate multiplied by an adjustment factor which adjusts the SFU to equal the mean impervious surface area of a statistical sampling typical of these residential dwelling units in the city. That adjustment factor has been determined to be as follows: 
(i)  Triplexes, condominiums and town houses shall have an adjustment factor of 0.39. 
(ii)  Condominium lofts and residential multifamily units shall have an adjustment factor of 0.33. 
(iii)  Duplexes shall have an adjustment factor of 0.51. 
(iv)  Residences located in mobile home parks shall have an adjustment factor of 0.46. 
The method for calculating the service fee for residential properties identified in subsections (1) and (2) above is as follows. 
Service Fee = SFU rate ($9.15/month) × Adjustment Factor 
Where, 
SFU rate is the Single-Family Residential Unit Rate that is applicable to one SFU. The SFU rate shall be set and may be modified from time to time by the city council. 
Adjustment factor is a numerical value that adjusts the SFU to equal the mean impervious surface area of a statistical sampling typical of other residential properties in the City of East Point. The adjustment factor shall be established by the city council. 
(3)  Nonresidential properties. Nonresidential properties shall mean, but shall not be limited to, commercial and office buildings, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces, parking lots, parks, recreation properties, public and private schools and universities, research stations, hospitals and convalescent centers, airports, churches and agricultural uses covered by impervious surfaces. The monthly service fee for nonresidential properties, including, but not limited to, government properties, commercial and office properties, industrial and manufacturing properties, institutional and non-profit properties, and parking lots shall be based upon the amount of square feet of impervious surface on each parcel, as determined by the public works department and approved by the city council through aerial photography, surface feature evaluation, or other processes, expressed in SFUs by rounding to the nearest tenth SFU. The service fee for nonresidential properties shall be the SFU rate multiplied by the number of SFUs calculated for a given parcel. The number of SFUs for a given parcel shall be determined by dividing the parcel's impervious surface by three thousand two hundred (3,200) sq. ft. 
_____ 
The method for calculating the service fee for each parcel of nonresidential property is as follows: 
Service Fee = Measured Impervious Surface (sq.ft.) × SFU rate ($9.15/month)  SFU (3,200 sq.ft.)

Sec. 8-2454. - Exemptions and credits applicable to stormwater service charges. 
Except as provided in this section, no public or private property shall be exempt from stormwater management utility service charges or receive a credit or offset against such service charges. No exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in stormwater service charges shall be granted based on the age, tax or economic status, race, or religion of the customer, or any other condition unrelated to the stormwater management utility's cost of providing stormwater services and facilities. Undeveloped lands and public right-of-ways shall be exempt. 
(a)  Developed land, including but not limited to multiple dwelling unit residential properties, individual detached dwelling units, groups of detached dwelling units represented by an incorporated homeowner's association, manufactured home and mobile home parks, commercial and office buildings, public buildings and structures, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces, parking lots, public streets, roads, alleys, and by-ways, parks, recreation properties, public and private schools and universities, research stations, hospitals and convalescent centers, airports, agricultural uses covered by impervious surfaces, water reservoirs, and water and wastewater treatment plants, may receive a stormwater service charge credit. The stormwater service charge credit shall be determined based on the technical requirements and standards contained in the stormwater management utility service charge credit policy to be established by the public works department and approved by city council. 
(b)  Any credit allowed against the service charge is conditioned on continuing compliance with the city's design and performance standards as stated in the stormwater management utility service charge credit policy and/or upon continuing the provision of the systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner or owners upon which the credit is based. 
(Ord. No. 018-12, § 1, 12-19-12) 
Sec. 8-2455. - Stormwater service charge billing, delinquencies, collections. 
(a)  Stormwater management utility service charges shall be billed and collected in the manner and at the interval deemed most efficient by the city, and shall be payable in accordance with the rules and regulations of the city finance department as applied generally to all bills. A stormwater service charge bill may be sent through the United States mail or by an alternate means notifying the customer of the amount of the bill, the date the payment is due, and the past due date. Failure to receive a bill is not justification for nonpayment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each parcel of developed land, as shown from public land records, shall be ultimately obligated to pay such fee. If a customer is underbilled or if no bill is sent, the city may back bill for a period of up to one (1) year, but shall not assess penalties for any delinquency. A one and one-half (1.5) percent per month late charge shall be billed based on the unpaid balance of any stormwater management utility service charge that becomes delinquent. 
(b)  The stormwater service charge shall be billed on a property tax bill. 
(c)  Any stormwater management utility service charge or portion of a service charge not paid when due may be recovered in an action at law or equity by the city. 
(d)  In addition to any other remedies or penalties provided by this or any other ordinance of the city, failure to pay any utility service charge may result in a discontinuance of any or all other utility services provided by the city or by others with whom contractual agreements provide for discontinuance of service for nonpayment. The owner of each property, building, premises, lot, or house shall be obligated to pay such fee, which shall be enforceable by the city by action at law or equity. 
(Ord. No. 018-12, § 1, 12-19-12) 
Sec. 8-2456. - Appeals.

Inasmuch as handbills and flyers are constantly being left on private premises and in public places, there is a problem with litter resulting from handbills that are oftentimes blown into the streets and onto lawns and not retrieved. The resulting litter is detrimental to the quality of life for city residents and interferes with the quiet enjoyment of their property. In addition to the litter problem created by handbill distribution, an accumulation of handbills on private property can be a signal to burglars or vandals that the residence is unoccupied. In order to address these threats to the public health, safety and welfare, sections 11-2008 through 11-2011 of this chapter govern the distribution of handbills and impose penalties for violations thereof.
