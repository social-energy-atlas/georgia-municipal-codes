PREFACE 
PRM LAW PUBLISHERS, a division of Public Research and Management, Inc. of Atlanta, Georgia, is pleased to publish this Code of Ordinances of Spalding County, Georgia. This volume contains laws of local application and County ordinances. 
The Code of Ordinances is an entirely new codification of all ordinances of a general and permanent nature. All obsolete, illegal, or superseded ordinances have been repealed as part of the codification. The Code has been adopted through the enactment of a single ordinance and thus constitutes the general body of ordinance enactments of the County. 
The Code includes several features that will facilitate its use. The various chapters and articles of the Code follow one another in a natural, logical order. The table of contents, with a complete outline of this order, will often provide sufficient reference points for the reader. In addition, the reader may consult the index of statutes and the index of ordinances at the end of the volume. At the beginning of each chapter there is a section-by-section analysis of the articles within the chapter. 
Non-textual provisions such as severability clauses, repeals, and enacting clauses are omitted from the text but are covered in Part I of the Code that applies to the entire Code. In most instances, references to "this ordinance" in the text of an ordinance have been changed to "this chapter" or "this article" as deemed appropriate. Various editorial notes such as State law references and cross references have been included throughout the Code to clarify its provisions. 
This Code is designed to serve as a complete compilation of ordinances and as a reliable reference guide. The citations included at the end of sections refer to the official source and date of laws and ordinances. Sections of the Code which do not have a citation represent new ordinances that have been added to fill in gaps or to replace ordinances which have become outdated. 
PRM LAW PUBLISHERS offers a full range of services to supplement this Code and to keep it current. It is published in loose-leaf form so that all new ordinances may be printed for inclusion on a regular basis. A periodic update-supplement service is available and may be secured through an agreement between the County and PRM. The County would send new ordinances and amendments to PRM, which would print replacement pages for the Code. Also, PRM will supplement the sections on State laws as amendments or new enactments occur in the General Assembly or by home rule amendment. 
We gratefully acknowledge the cooperation and assistance rendered by the County officials in the preparation of this Code. 

 
Addendum 
Commencing with Supplement No. 2 to this Code in 1983, periodic updates have been provided by the Municipal Code Corporation of Tallahassee, Florida. Following the publication of Supplement No. 13 in December of 1993, the County authorized a reprinting of the entire Code including amendments and changes enacted by ordinances and legislation passed through December 1994. This reproduction constitutes a replacement volume to the prior Code, and future supplements will commence with Supplement No. 1. 
The reproduction of this Code was under the direct supervision of Robert S. Hornyak, Editor, with the assistance of Felecia D. Wilson, and credit is gratefully given to other members of the publisher's staff for their able assistance throughout the project. 

 
An Ordinance of the Board of Commissioners of Spalding County, Georgia, Adopting and Enacting a New Code for Spalding County, Georgia; Establishing the Same; Providing for the Repeal of Certain Ordinances not Included Therein, Except as Herein Expressly Provided; Providing for the Manner of Amending Such Code; Providing When This Ordinance Shall Become Effective; Providing Certain Penalties; and for Other Purposes. 
Be it Ordained by the Board of Commissioners of Spalding County, Georgia, and it is Hereby Ordained by Authority of the Same as Follows: 
Section 1.  The document entitled "The Code of Spalding County, Georgia," a copy whereof accompanies this ordinance and is incorporated herein and made a part hereof, consisting of Parts I through XI and Appendices I to III, each inclusive, is hereby adopted and enacted as the "Code of Spalding County, Georgia," and shall be treated and considered as a new and original comprehensive ordinance which shall supersede all other general and permanent ordinances passed by the Board of Commissioners prior to February 15, 1977, except such as by reference thereto are expressly saved from repeal or continued in force and effect for any purpose. 
Section 2.  All provisions of such Code shall be in full force and effect on and after February 15, 1977, and all ordinances and resolutions of a general and permanent nature of Spalding County enacted on final passage on or before February 15, 1977, and not in such Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein are hereby repealed from and after the effective date of this ordinance, except as hereinafter provided. 
Section 3.  The repeal provided for in Section 2 hereof shall not affect any offense or act committed or done or any penalty or forfeiture incurred or any contract or right established or accruing before the effective date of this ordinance; nor shall such repeal affect any ordinance or resolution of the County promising or guaranteeing the payment of money by or to the County, or authorizing the issuance of any bonds of the County, or any evidence of the County's indebtedness, or any contract or obligation assumed by the County; nor shall such repeal affect any rights or franchise granted by any ordinance or resolution of the Board of Commissioners to any person, firm or corporation; nor shall such repeal affect any ordinance or resolution dedicating, naming, establishing, locating, relocating, opening, paving, widening, vacating, etc., any street or public way in the County; nor shall such repeal affect the annual appropriation of the County, nor shall such repeal affect any ordinance or resolution levying or imposing license fees or taxes; nor shall such repeal affect any ordinance or resolution providing for local improvements and assessing taxes therefor; nor shall such repeal affect any ordinance or resolution relating to the building regulations of the County including the electrical and plumbing regulations; nor shall such repeal be construed to revive any ordinance or resolution or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance or resolution which is repealed by this ordinance. 
Section 4.  Any and all additions or amendments to such Code, when passed in such form as to indicate the intention of the Board of Commissioners to make the same a part thereof, shall be deemed to be incorporated into such Code so that reference to the "Code of Spalding County, Georgia", shall be understood and intended to include such additions and amendments. 
Section 5.  A copy of such Code shall be kept on file in the office of the Clerk, and preserved in looseleaf form, or in such other form as the Clerk may consider most expedient. It shall be the express duty of the Clerk or someone authorized by her, to insert in their designated places all amendments, ordinances or resolutions which indicate the intention of the Board of Commissioners to make the same a part of such Code, when the same have been printed or reprinted in page form, and to extract from such Code all provisions which may be from time to time repealed by the Board of Commissioners. This copy of such Code shall be available for all persons desiring to examine the same and shall be considered the official Code of Spalding County. 
Section 6.  As pages of the Code are replaced because the matter contained on them shall have been repealed, amended, or otherwise shall have been superseded or rendered obsolete or inoperative, the Clerk shall retain copies of such pages of the Code so superseded, rendered obsolete or otherwise rendered inoperative in a file for the purpose so that the former provisions of the Code may be readily available and easily found. The purpose of this section is to permit anyone desiring to do so to ascertain the precise status of any section of the Code as of any given date. 
Section 7.  In case of the amendment of any section of such Code for which a penalty is not provided, the general penalty as provided in Section 1-1007 of such Code shall apply to the section as amended; or in case such amendment contains provisions for which a penalty, other than the aforementioned general penalty, is provided in another section in the same chapter, the penalty so provided in such other section shall be held to relate to the section so amended, unless such penalty is specifically repealed therein. 
Section 8.  It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation in Spalding County to change or amend by additions or deletions, any part or portion of such Code, or to insert or delete pages or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner whatsoever which may cause the law of Spalding County to be misrepresented thereby. 
Section 9.  All ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflict herewith are, to the extent of such conflict, hereby repealed. 
Section 10.  This ordinance shall be in force and take effect on February 15, 1977. 
Adopted this 15th day of February, 1977.

SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement.

Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of private corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project affected by such indenture. (1982 Ga.

Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in any trust indenture, surplus monies in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be cancelled and shall not again be issued.

Service of said notice shall be made only in the county by any official or person authorized by law to serve process in the superior court or by a duly qualified marshal of said small claims court; or by registered or certified mail with receipt; or by any person not a party to or otherwise interested in the suit, especially appointed by the judge of said court for that purpose. 
(c)  When notice is to be served by registered or certified mail, the clerk or the judge shall enclose a copy of the statement of claim, verification and notice in an envelope addressed to the defendant at his last known address, prepay the postage from monies collected for that purpose, and mail the same forthwith, noting on the record the date and hour of mailing. When receipt therefor is returned, the clerk or judge shall attach the same to the original statement and notice of claim, or otherwise file it as a part of the record in the case, and it shall be prima facie evidence of service upon the defendant. If the sealed envelope in which said notice was mailed to the defendant by registered or certified mail is returned to the sender by United States postal authorities for any reason, service may be perfected on such defendant by any method as now or hereafter prescribed by the pertinent laws of Georgia providing for service of pleadings on defendants in the superior courts of Georgia.

If a party shall fail to pay accrued costs, the judge shall have power to deny said party the right to file any new case while such costs remain unpaid, and likewise to deny such litigant the right to proceed further in any case pending. The award of court costs, as between the parties, shall be according to the discretion of the judge and shall be taxed in the cause at his discretion. 
(b)  Whenever a claim affidavit and bond is filed by a third party claiming personal property that has been attached or levied upon under an attachment or execution issued from the small claims court, the levying officer shall forthwith return the same to said court and, unless the claimant makes written demand for a jury trial, the issues raised by such claim affidavit shall be heard and determined by the judge of said small claims court, and the judge shall be entitled to twelve dollars and fifty cents ($12.50) plus four dollars ($4.00) for each additional defendant over one for every such claim case.

It shall he unlawful for any person in the county to change or amend by additions or deletions, any part or portion of this Code, or to insert or delete pages, or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner whatsoever except by ordinance or other official act of the commissioners, which will cause the law of the county to be misrepresented thereby.

Editor's note— A resolution adopted Jan. 3, 1995, relative to organization of meetings of the board of commissioners, not specifically amendatory of this Code, has been treated as superseding, in effect repealing, former §§ 2-1001 and 2-1004 and enacting new provisions in lieu thereof which have been added as §§ 2-1001—2-1022. Former §§ 2-1002, 2-1003 and 2-1005 have been renumbered as §§ 2-1023, 2-1024 and 2-1025, respectively, to accommodate the inclusion of the new provisions. Formerly, such superseded sections pertained to annual organizational meeting; election of chairman and vice-chairman, and regular meetings, special meetings, quorum of members and voting, and derived from F-77, adopted Feb. 4, 1975, and Ord.

The appointing commissioner may discharge his/her appointees at any time and name other persons to serve in their place. 
(c)  The review board will conduct a public hearing based upon the complaint. A majority vote of the review board members present shall determine whether or not a violation of the ethics ordinance has occurred. Upon reaching their decision, the review board shall submit to the county clerk their written findings whether or not a violation of this ordinance has occurred.

Any protestant may make arrangements to have all, or any part, of such evidence transcribed or recorded for him at his sole expense upon his giving notice in writing to the commissioners at their office at least two (2) days before the date of such meeting of his intention to do so, in which event he shall cause a complete copy of such transcript and record to be furnished the county contemporaneously with his receipt of such transcript or record at no expense whatever to the county. If the commissioners, or a majority of them, desire they may likewise have all, or any part, of such testimony or evidence transcribed or recorded for them at the expense of the county, and in the event the construction or making of such improvements is subsequently confirmed, ratified or ordered, as aforesaid, such expense of the county may be included as a part of the costs of such improvements. In the event the evidence is transcribed or recorded at the instance of any protestant or the commissioners, as aforesaid, any other protestant present, or represented by legal counsel, shall have the right of ordering, purchasing and obtaining a transcript or copy of such record from the reporter by orally requesting same Section 4-1015 such meeting convenes but before any testimony or evidence is offered or tendered by any protestant. The rules governing admissibility of such evidence shall be applied and administered by the presiding officer of the commissioners at such meeting, or by his delegated agent, attorney or representative, and shall be the same rules as those governing the admissibility of evidence in the superior court of the county. Any protestant, as aforesaid, desiring to be present at such meeting shall, if so requested in his written protest, be entitled to receive notice of the time and place that such meeting shall be held, provided however that such protestant shall in his written protest state his mailing address to which he requests that such notice be sent. The commissioners, their clerk, agent or attorney, or any one (1) of them, may give such notice by sending a statement of the time and place that such meeting shall be held by certified mail at least three (3) days before the date of such meeting to any protestant so requesting such notice at his mailing address as given in his written protest, and in the event such mailing address is not given as aforesaid such protestant shall thereby have waived his right to receive such notice. The certificate of the person giving or mailing any such notice shall be sufficient evidence that such notice has been given in full compliance herewith. In the event such authorizing resolution, after such protest, is confined or ratified by the commissioners, the commissioners upon the expiration of ten (10) days after such confirmation may proceed as soon as they deem it practicable to have such improvements or work made or done and to determine and assess the costs of such improvements or work as hereinafter specified, unless legal actions which interfere with or prevent the making of such improvements and assessments shall have been commenced. In the event such authorizing resolution is rejected or rescinded, as aforesaid, a petition by property owners, as hereinbefore provided, proposing the making of the same or similar improvements, so rejected, shall not be reconsidered by the commissioners within six (6) months after such rejection; however the making of such improvements so rejected may be reconsidered at any time upon a resolution proposed by one (1) or more of the commissioners and unanimously approved and adopted by all of the commissioners at any annual, regular or special meeting of the commissioners. (E-129, 8-3-65, § 15) 
Sec. 4-1016. - Costs. 
After such improvements or work has been completed, the costs of such improvements or work shall be determined by resolution of the commissioners, or a majority of them. The costs shall include the costs or expenses of acquiring necessary rights-of-way and the costs or charges of the improvements or work made or done by contract or by the county, and may include the costs of making such improvements on, at costs of administration, supervision and inspection, interest on money allocated or used to assume or pay such costs, and all other costs and expenses incurred in connection with such improvements or work. (E-129, 8-3-65, § 16) 
Sec. 4-1017. - Portion of costs assumed by county. 
After such costs have been determined, as aforesaid, the county shall assume or pay one-third ( 1/3 ) of all such costs. (E-129, 8-3-65, § 17) 
Sec. 4-1018. - Assessments. 
The remaining two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of all such costs shall be equitably assessed by resolution of the commissioners, or a majority of them. Such assessments shall be declared, made and apportioned against the respective owners of the property abutting such improvements (exclusive of the owners of any public street or road intersected or joined by such improvements) pro rata and in the direct proportion that the length of frontage of each such owner's parcel or tract of abutting property bears to the total frontage improved. Such total frontage improved shall include both sides of the improvement or street, exclusive of the frontage or width of any public street or road intersected or joined by such improvements, provided however that such assessments made solely for grading, paving, or otherwise improving sidewalks or installing curbs and gutters shall be apportioned against the respective owners of the property on the particular side of the street or road abutting such sidewalk, curb, gutter or in that the length of frontage of each such owner's improvement pro rata and in the direct proportion street or road exclusive of the frontage or width of any public street or road intersected or joined by such sidewalk, curb, gutter or improvement. (E-129, 8-3-65, § 18) 
Section 4-1019. - Assessment book. 
The clerk shall provide and keep a permanent and well-bound book to be known as the "Spalding County Assessment Book for Street Improvements" and shall provide additional volumes as the same are needed. Each volume shall bear a separate number or letter and the pages thereof shall be numbered consecutively. The book shall be so indexed as to show each street or each improvement and shall contain appropriate columns for a county tax map reference or a brief description of each parcel of land assessed, the name of the apparent owner, the lineal frontage on such street or improvement and the amount of the assessment apportioned against each parcel or tract of property abutting such street or such improvement. No error, omission or mistake in regard to the name of the owner shall invalidate any assessment. Corrections may be made by the clerk of any entry in any such assessment book by delineating the incorrect or improper entry and substituting in lieu thereof the added, revised or corrected entry and each such correction shall bear the initials of the clerk in the margin of the page and opposite such correction within the insertion of the date of any such correction. Each such book shall be a public record, and the entry therein of any assessment shall constitute a notice to the public of the lien against the land so assessed. (E-129, 8-3-65, § 19) 
Section 4-1020. - Lien of assessments. 
The resolution adopted by the commissioners authorizing any such improvements, as hereinbefore set out in section 4-1007, shall also provide for the making of a general assessment of the cost against the abutting property owners, and such resolution shall thereby create an inchoate lien against such abutting property. Such lien, however, shall become fixed as to the amount upon the adoption of the final resolution apportioning the specific assessments, as hereinbefore provided in section 4-1018, and such specific assessments shall date and rank from the date of adoption of such final resolution. The liens so created shall have the same rank and character as liens for and valorem taxes due the county, and co-equal with the liens for such ad valorem taxes, and all persons shall be charged with the notice of the existence of said liens effective from the date of the adoption of the authorizing resolution making the general assessment and the recording of such authorizing resolution on the minutes of the meetings of the commissioners. (E-129, § 20, 8-3-65) 
Sec. 4-1021. - Due date of assessments. 
All such assessments shall be due and payable to the county sixty (60) days from the date of adoption by the commissioners of the final resolution fixing the total costs of the improvements and making the assessments against the abutting property owners. Each such assessment shall bear interest at the rate of six (6) per cent per annum from its due date. Any owner, however, may elect to pay the whole or any part of any such assessment in installments in the manner hereinafter provided. Where no such election is made or where a default occurs in the payment of the assessment, an execution may be issued for the enforcement of such assessment. Such execution shall be issued in the name of the county and shall bear interest at the rate of seven (7) per cent per annum from the date of issuance and may be enforced by levy and sale by the sheriff of the county in the same manner that and valorem tax executions are enforced. Such execution may be recorded on the general execution docket in the office of the clerk of the superior court of the county in the same manner and for the same purposes and effect as provided by law for recording and valorem tax executions. (E-129, § 21, 8-3-65) 
Sec. 4-1022. - Installment payments, notes and executions. 
Any such owner may elect, as aforesaid, to pay the whole or any part of any such assessment in five (5) or less equal annual installments of principal plus accrued interest thereon, payable annually, at the rate of six (6) per cent per annum from the due date of such assessment. Each property owner desiring to avail himself of the installment plan of payment shall, within sixty (60) days after the final assessment is made, execute and deliver to the commissioners such note or notes, payable to the county, in such form and tenor as the commissioners shall prescribe, to bear interest at the aforesaid rate and to mature as provided by the terms of such note so long as such maturity date does not exceed five (5) years and thirty-one (31) days from the due date of such assessment. The maker or makers of any such note shall have the right and privilege on the due date of any such annual installment payment of prepaying the entire principal amount of any such note, then outstanding and unpaid, or prepaying the entire last annual installment payment of any such note, then outstanding and unpaid, thereby retiring such prepaid principal without further interest. Each such note or notes shall be negotiable in form and shall constitute a lien against the property so assessed, which property shall be referred to or briefly described in each such note or instrument. In case of a default in the payment of any one of the installments, then and in such event the remainder of said installments shall, at the option of the holder of such note, immediately become due and payable and the commissioners, or any person to whom any such note has been transferred or assigned, shall have the right to have execution issued thereon for the full balance due with interest to the date of the issuance of such execution. Such holder may proceed to enforce the execution by levy upon the property described in such note, or any other property of the owner within the county, such execution to be levied and enforced by the sheriff of the county, or his lawful deputies, in the same manner and in accordance with the pertinent laws of Georgia regulating and governing other sheriff's sales in the county. Each such execution shall be issued in the name of the county, and shall bear teste in the name of the governing authority of said county, being the commissioners, and be signed by the clerk. If the note for the assessment has been transferred by the county to another holder, the execution shall issue and be enforced in the name of the county but for the benefit and use of the holder of such note. (E-129, § 22, 8-3-65; Res. of 10-3-78, § 1) 
Sec. 4-1023. - Affidavits of illegality. 
The defendant in any such execution shall have the right to contest the legality of the same, including the amount due, if any ground for such contest exists. The procedure for contesting any such execution shall be by an affidavit of illegality as provided by the laws of Georgia, and the procedure thereon shall be the same as that provided for the contesting of the legality of executions for ad valorem taxes. If the defendant should contest the legality of the execution, he shall state what amount, if any, he admits to be correctly due, and before filing any such affidavit of illegality he shall pay such admitted amount to the county, and state that he has paid such admitted amount due in his proceedings contesting the legality or unpaid amount of such execution. All such affidavits so filed shall be returned to the superior court of the county; and the issue thus made shall be determined as provided by the laws of Georgia in cases of illegality, expressly subject to the penalties provided by law in cases of illegality filed for delay. (E-129, § 23, 8-3-65) 
Sec. 4-1024. - Transfer of executions. 
Any execution issued under the provisions of the within county street improvement and assessment regulations may be sold, transferred or assigned by the sheriff or his lawful deputy, when so authorized and directed by the commissioners as the governing authority of the county; and property of the defendant therein may be levied upon and sold in the same manner and in accordance with the pertinent laws of Georgia providing for and regulating the sale, transfer, assignment, recording, levy and enforcement of ad valorem tax executions. (E-129, § 24, 8-3-65) 
Sec. 4-1025. - Eminent domain. 
The commissioners, as the governing authority of the county, are empowered, as provided by the Constitution and laws of Georgia, to acquire whatever property may be necessary to the making of any of the improvements for which provision is herein made and to this end hereby reserve the right and privilege to exercise any and all of the powers of eminent domain, as provided by law, in effecting this chapter and in executing and enforcing the within regulations. (E-129, § 25, 8-3-65) 
Sec. 4-1026. - Rights and powers cumulative. 
All of the rights, remedies and powers herein set out to be executed by the county or the commissioners as its governing authority or the clerk or any officer of the county shall not be deemed to be exclusive but shall be cumulative and not restrictive of any other rights, remedies and powers under the laws of the state; and the failure to exercise any such right, remedy or power at any time shall not constitute a waiver to subsequently exercise any such right, remedy or power. (E-129, § 26, 8-3-65) 
Sec. 4-1207. - Reserved. 
Editor's note— Section 702 of the Subdivision Ordinance of Spalding County, adopted April 26, 1994, and included herein as Appendix A to Appendix IV (Zoning), repealed former section 4-1027 in its entirety. Former section 4-1027 pertained to specifications for subdivision streets and derived from E-129, § 27, 2-20-73; Ord. of 12-5-89, § 1; Ord. No. 93-03, § 1, 4-21-93. 
Sec. 4-1028. - Specifications for driveways. 
(a)  Driveway standards. The drawing on page 4-11, labeled "Spalding County Driveway Standard," provides the minimum standards for driveways in the county. 
(b)  Driveway pipes or culverts. 
(1)  Pipes or culverts installed for driveways shall be 16 gauge corrugated metal pipes with beveled ends, 26 feet in length or longer. No PVC, plastic or other types of culvert shall be used. 
(2)  Each driveway culvert shall be covered with a minimum of twelve (12) inches of dirt cover, unless the terrain or other construction conditions require a variance which may be obtained from the public works director, or his designee, or upon his denial from the board of commissioners if granted by said board. 
SPALDING COUNTY DRIVEWAY STANDARD 

(1)  Concrete driveway: Four-inch concrete. 
(2)  Crusher run driveway: Six-inch crusher run. 
(3)  Asphalt driveway: Six-inch crusher run, prime coat, two-inch E mix topping. 
From radius point to radius point must be twenty (20) feet wide minimum. Concrete must be 3000 D.O.T. mix. 
Notice must be given to Spalding County Public Works Department (770-467-4774) twenty-four (24) hours prior to installing driveway pipe before covering with dirt. Contact Community Development at 770-467-4220 before pouring concrete on county right-of-way. Please give twenty-four (24) hours notice. 
There shall be no charge for the first inspection. If, for any reason, the proposed driveway does not meet Spalding County Standards, or the landowner does not comply with the ordinance and the public works director/designee has to return, the property owner shall first pay a reinspection fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) prior to any subsequent inspection. 
(3)  Cover materials shall be at a grade level lower than the roadway, back to the center of the ditch, so as to eliminate or reduce traffic problems. 
(c)  Driveway permits 
(1)  No driveway shall be constructed or permitted until a permit therefor is issued. 
(2)  An application for such permit shall be filed with the Spalding County public works director at least three (3) days before issuance of a permit to allow ample time for the public works director, or his designee, to determine whether the proposed size of the pipe is suitable, whether a ditch is required and whether the proposed ditch will provide for proper drainage. Prior to the land owner requesting the public works director to inspect the property, the owner shall identify the area for the desired driveway by staking same with a sufficient number of stakes to clearly indicate the location of the proposed driveway. If the public works director comes to the property to inspect the location of the proposed driveway at the request of the land owner, and the proposed driveway is not staked as aforesaid, then no permit shall be issued until the land owner has paid a fifty-dollar ($50.00) reinspection fee, in advance. Each subsequent trip to the site of the proposed driveway, necessitated by the land owner's failure to stake the proposed location, shall likewise result in a fifty-dollar ($50.00) reinspection fee. 
(3)  Once the drainage pipe has been placed and the driveway has been constructed, the land owner shall request the public works director to make a final inspection. There shall be no charge for this inspection. However, if for any reason the public works director needs to return to the driveway for an additional inspection trip, then, prior to making an additional inspection, the land owner shall be required to pay to the public works department the reinspection fee of fifty dollars ($50.00). Each inspection made by the public works director after the initial free inspection shall result in a fifty-dollar ($50.00) fee being paid in advance by the land owner. 
(4)  If the property owner desires to pave his driveway with either concrete or asphalt, then such paving must comply with Spalding County driveway standards which require four (4) inches—3000 mix concrete or six (6) inches crusher run and prime coat two (2) inches of "E" mix topping. Prior to paving the driveway, the property owner shall first install the concrete forms or asphalt preparations, which shall be set to Spalding County driveway standards. Once these forms or asphalt preparations are in place, the property owner shall request the Spalding County Building Official or his designee to inspect the forms or the asphalt preparations. There shall be no charge for the first inspection. Once the building official has made his inspection and finds that the concrete forms or asphalt preparation set meet Spalding County's driveway standards, then the property owner shall be free to pave his driveway. If the building official has to return to the property for another inspection for any reason, then the property owner shall first pay a reinspection fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) prior to any subsequent inspection. Each subsequent trip to the site of the proposed driveway, necessitated by the land owner's failure to comply with this section, shall result in a fifty-dollar ($50.00) fee being paid, in advance, by the property owner. 
(d)  Improperly installed driveways . 
(1)  Any driveway installed without first obtaining a permit therefor, as herein set forth, may be removed by the county from the road right-of-way, if the property owner fails to apply for a driveway permit, as hereinbefore provided, within thirty (30) days after being so notified by the county. Upon such application for the driveway being made, a permit may then be issued, as hereinabove provided, for the driveway to be reconstructed by the owner in compliance with the specifications and requirements as hereinbefore set out. In the event no application for a permit is filed, the county shall have the right to remove any nonpermitted driveway, or any driveway not constructed in compliance with these specifications or requirements herein set out, from the road right-of-way, and thereafter the property owner may deposit a dollar amount commensurate to the pipe size required for driveway with the public works director; and thereupon the county shall reconstruct or replace such driveway, pursuant to the specifications set out herein. 
(e)  Temporary driveway. In the event the property owner needs temporary access for less than twelve (12) months to and from a county road, he shall deposit a dollar amount commensurate to the pipe size required for driveway with the public works director along with his application for temporary driveway permit. Upon approval he shall then be permitted to construct such temporary driveway on the county's road right-of-way as specified and permitted by the roads superintendent, or his designee. Upon the termination of the permitted period of time, the permittee shall remove the temporary driveway and restore such right-of-way to the physical condition of such right-of-way that existed when the the dollar amount commensurate to the pipe size required for driveway was deposited so as to be eligible to make application to the public works director to obtain such deposit upon verification by the roads superintendent that the right-of-way has been so restored. If the permittee fails to remove such temporary driveway or to restore such right-of-way, as hereinabove provided, the county shall retain the deposit commensurate with the pipe size required for driveway.

(c)  To the extent feasible and practicable, utility line crossings of the road shall cross on a line generally normal to the roadway alignment. Oblique roadway crossings have several objections and should be avoided wherever practicable; provided, however, that when any alignment is deemed impractical by the building inspector he may approve applications containing such alignment as he deems appropriate under the existing conditions. 
(d)  The horizontal and vertical location of all utility facilities within the road right-of-way limits shall conform with the policies applicable for the particular type of road and the specific engineering conditions and designs as may from time to time be promulgated by the building inspector for that type of road or for the particular roadway section involved. Above ground utility facilities are a form of road side obstacles and their location must be consistent with the clearances applicable to all road side obstacles involved.

a.  The grade of the top of any pipe within the road right-of-way shall be established to provide minimum burying as follows: under pavement surface four (4) feet; under other surfaces, including underlying ditches, three (3) feet, and under a sidewalk, paved ditch or ditch gutter, two (2) feet. 
b.  For flexible pipe under pavement, minimum bury shall be four (4) feet or the outside diameter of the pipe, whichever is greater. 
c.  Where less than the minimum bury, as herein before set out, is necessary to conform to existing conditions or other planned work or is essential to avoid rock excavation, the laying of pipelines below the permanent water table or other physical conflicts, the top of the pipe must not project into the pavement sub-base and when required by the building inspector shall be protected with an acceptable casing or capping. 
(b)  The design for the installation, location, alignment, burying, encasement and attachment to roadway structures of pole lines, cables and pipelines and all appurtenances thereto, including vents, drains, markers, man holes and shut-offs shall be the same as provided by the Georgia Department of Transportation in its policy and procedure for accommodation of utilities unless waived or otherwise specified by the building inspector.

(LETTER TO SEND FOR INSPECTIONS OF EXISTING SEWERAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEMS) 
TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: 
Re: 
Pursuant to the request of _______, this Department was requested to conduct a sewerage disposal system inspection at the above captioned property. The records maintained in this office indicate that the sewerage disposal system is a Drip Emitter System and is not a conventional "septic tank" system. This Department does not have the expertise nor the competence to inspect Drip Emitter Systems and therefore must rely entirely upon the report attached to this letter. This report is from the company that has performed the routine inspections and maintenance of this system. 
Our Department has reviewed previous sewerage inspection documentation on file and has no document which would indicate that there has been a sewerage malfunction. This inspection in no way guarantees the operating capabilities of the system nor is there any representation made that the system has been properly maintained in the past. Further, this Department is not expressing any option as to the general operating condition of the system or the necessity of replacing the system in the future.

(2)  Estimate of gross receipts in absence of return. If any licensee fails to make a return, the excise tax collector shall make an estimate of the amount of the gross receipts of the licensee or, as the case may be, of the amount of the total sales which are subject to the tax. The estimate shall be made for the period or periods in respect to which the licensee failed to make the return and shall be based upon any information which is or may come into the possession of the excise tax collector. Upon the basis of this estimate, the excise tax collector shall compute and determine the amount required to be paid to the governing authority. One (1) or more determinations may be made for one (1) or for more than one (1) period. 
(3)  Offsetting of overpayments. In making a determination, the excise tax collector may offset overpayments, for a period or periods, against underpayments, for another period or periods, against penalties and against the interest on underpayments.

If the licensee determines that it has overpaid or paid more than once, which fact has not been determined by the excise tax collector, the licensee will have three (3) years from the date of payment to file a claim in writing stating the specific ground upon which claim is founded. The claim shall be audited. If the claim is approved by the county, the excess amount paid to the county may be credited on amounts then due and payable from the licensee by whom it was paid or the licensee's administrators or executors. 
(d)  The operator, in the event of licensee's failure to pay tax when due, shall pay a penalty of fifty (50) percent of the amount due plus interest on the total amount of delinquent taxes at the rate of ten (10) percent per annum. In addition, the licensee shall not be entitled to the fee allowed in section 6-1018(d)(5) of this article. The late penalty will be strictly enforced. 
Further penalties against the licensee:

Sec. 6-3001. - Findings and public purpose. 
Based on the experiences of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Austin, Texas, Daytona, Florida, Gwinnett County, Georgia, and Garden Grove, California, which experiences are found to be relevant to the problems faced by Spalding County, Georgia; and based on the documentary evidence and oral testimony presented at the board of commissioners' hearing on August 14, 2007, and based upon the holdings and evidence of the harmful secondary effects caused by sexually oriented businesses described in prior judicial opinions such as City of Los Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc. , 535 U.S. 425 (2002), City of Erie v. Pap's A.M. , 529 U.S. 277 (2000); 44 Liquormart v. Rhode Island , 517 U.S. 484 (1996); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc. , 501 U.S. 560 (1991); City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc. , 475 U.S. 41 (1986); New York State Liquor Authority v. Bellanca , 452 U.S. 714 (1981), Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc. , 427 U.S. 50 (1976); California v. Larue , 409 U.S. 109 (1972); Daytona Grand, Inc. v. City of Daytona Beach, Fla. , 490 F.3d 860 (11 th Cir. 2007); Zibtluda, LLC v. Gwinnett County , 411 F.3d 1278 (11 th Cir. 2007); Peek-A-Boo Lounge of Bradenton, Inc. v. Manatee County, Fla. , 337 F.3d 1251 (11th Cir. 2003); Sammy's of Mobile, Ltd. v. City of Mobile , 140 F.3d 993 (11th Cir. 1998), the Spalding County Board of Commissioners takes note of the well-known and self-evident conditions and secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among the various communities within our country. 
It is the finding of the Board of Commissioners of Spalding County that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in establishments offering live nude entertainment or "adult entertainment," (whether such alcoholic beverages are sold on the premises or not) begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. In the same manner, establishments offering cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the community. 
Among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, live commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are disorderly conduct, prostitution, public solicitation, public indecency, drug use and drug trafficking. Among the undesirable community conditions identified in other communities with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior herein above described. The board of commissioners finds it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions will result in Spalding County, as well. 
Furthermore, it is the finding of the Spalding County Board of Commissioners that other forms of adult entertainment including, but not limited to, adult bookstores, adult novelty shops, adult video stores, peep shows, adult theaters, and massage parlors have an adverse effect upon the quality of life in surrounding communities. 
The Board of Commissioners of Spalding County, Georgia, therefore finds that it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community and the preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, and of churches, schools, residential areas, public parks and children's daycare facilities to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of sexually oriented businesses, also commonly referred to as adult entertainment establishments. 
Therefore, the Board of Commissioners of Spalding County finds that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult entertainment establishment. The board finds that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including but not limited to, reducing criminal activity and protecting against or eliminating undesirable community conditions and further finds that such will not infringe upon the protected Constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression. To that end, this chapter is hereby adopted.

CHAPTER 8. - MEDIA PRODUCTIONS 

Sec. 6-8001. - Purpose. 
It is the public policy of the State of Georgia to market the state as a location for media productions, recognizing the economic impact this industry provides, as well as the tourism it generates for local jurisdictions, such as the Spalding County. Spalding County is further fortunate to have a diverse number of unique locations to attract movies and television productions to the county. 
Despite the many positive benefits a media production may offer, certain inconveniences may result if the production company and county cannot work in concert to assure minimum standards are met and to assure a thoroughly-planned production schedule is followed. These concerns are best addressed through a regulatory permit. 
(Ord. No. 2016-13, § 1, 10-17-16) 
Sec. 6-8002. - Scope of coverage. 
The permit required under this chapter shall be a requirement for all movies, television or video series, pilots, feature films and documentaries, commercials, music videos, photo shoots, infomercials and public service announcements, whether the final product is intended for commercial use or not, unless the activity shall wholly occur on private property within an otherwise licensed facility (such as a film or television studio). Any media production on public property, intended to be closed to participation by the public, or restricting access to public property or facilities normally accessible by the public, shall require a permit. For purposes of this chapter, media production activity shall include areas designated for parking of trucks and equipment on public or private property, base camps used during the production activity, and food service areas. No public highway, street or road shall have its public access restricted or limited except by a permit issued pursuant to this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2016-13, § 1, 10-17-16) 
Sec. 6-8003. - Permit requirements. 
(a)  This permit is allowed with conditions in all zoning districts. Whenever a permit is sought for activities in primarily residential neighborhoods, extra consideration shall be given to the conditions imposed to ameliorate as much as possible inconvenience to the residents. 
(b)  Two (2) classifications of media production permits are allowed: 
(1)  Low-impact activities are generally those activities having an intended duration of no more than fourteen (14) consecutive days, with little or no disruption to normal and customary use of the site and adjacent and nearby properties and uses; and 
(2)  High-impact activities are generally those activities having an intended duration of fifteen (15) or more consecutive days, which do not comply with the low-impact standards of this chapter, and/or will disrupt normal and customary use of the site and adjacent and nearby properties and uses. Any filming involving automobile crashes or chases, gunfire, pyrotechnics, explosives, the use of aircraft, stunts, and similar activities are examples of high-impact activities. 
(c)  General standards . Prior to making application for a permit, it shall be incumbent on the applicant to meet with the county manager and/or his designee, or their designees, to review locations and the general scope of activities planned during the production. A copy of the script shall be made available, upon request, to allow the county staff to better understand the applicant's needs. 
The following general standards shall apply to all permits: 
(1)  No tents, temporary sanitary facilities, trash collection, or food service facilities shall be located within one hundred (100) feet of the property line of any property used for residential use, unless the owner or tenant gives written consent; 
(2)  Tents, depending on their square footage, and other temporary structures may require a separate building permit from the county; any food preparation or food service provided at the location shall require a food service permit from the county health department, or evidence of exemption; 
(3)  Lighting for filming should be oriented away from adjacent or nearby properties as much as possible and shall not interfere with the safe movement of vehicular traffic; 
(4)  Temporary signage must be approved in writing, in advance, prior to erection, by the development director, or his designee; approval of temporary signage is conditioned restoration of permanent signage following completion of the media activity; 
(5)  No regulatory traffic control signage within a public right-of-way shall be removed without the prior written consent of the Spalding County Sheriff; 
(6)  No modification to any existing traffic signage, street light, traffic control device or other officially-installed facility or improvement shall be made without prior consent of the Spalding County Sheriff; 
(7)  No street, road, alley, or sidewalk shall be closed, barricaded or other obstruction erected within a public right-of-way, and no access shall be denied or restricted to public or private property or facilities unless the closure or restriction is approved as a condition of the permit; reasonable alternative access shall be arranged whenever possible; 
(8)  No trees, vegetation (including grasses), or ornamental shrubs shall be cut or removed from public property without prior written consent of the county in the permit, based upon an agreed landscape restoration plan. A land disturbance permit may be separately required depending upon the nature and extent of the activity; 
(9)  Traffic management plan. The applicant shall submit to the Spalding County Sheriff's Office a traffic management plan to address traffic flow in the vicinity of the location where production activity is to occur, even if normal traffic flow is not to be obstructed or interrupted.

(Ord. No. 2005-02, § 6, 4-4-05) 
Sec. 8-4007. - Discharge prohibitions. 
(a)  Prohibition of illegal discharges. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the county storm drain system or watercourses any materials, including but not limited to pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, other than stormwater. 
The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited except as described as follows: 
(1)  The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions established by this chapter: water line flushing or other potable water sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped ground water, foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs, non-commercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wetland flows, swimming pools (if dechlorinated - typically less than one (1) PPM chlorine), fire fighting activities, and any other water source not containing pollutants. 
(2)  Discharges specified in writing by the authorized enforcement agency as being necessary to protect public health and safety. 
(3)  Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal notification to the authorized enforcement agency prior to the time of the test. 
(4)  The prohibition shall not apply to any non-stormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm drain system. 
(b)  Prohibition of illicit connections. 
(1)  The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited. 
(2)  This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. 
(3)  A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection to continue. 
(Ord. No. 2005-02, § 7, 4-4-05) 
Sec. 8-4008. - Suspension of MS4 access. 
(a)  Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The community development department may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or Waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or Waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons. 
(b)  Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the authorized enforcement agency for a reconsideration and hearing. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the authorized enforcement agency. 
(Ord. No. 2005-02, § 8, 4-4-05) 
Sec. 8-4009. - Industrial or construction activity discharges. 
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the community development department prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. 
(Ord. No. 2005-02, § 9, 4-4-05) 
Sec. 8-4010. - Monitoring of discharges. 
(a)  Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction activity. 
(b)  Access to facilities. 
(1)  The community development department shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this chapter as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency. 
(2)  Facility operators shall allow the community development department ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law. 
(3)  The community development department shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge. 
(4)  The community development department has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
(5)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the community development department and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator/owner. 
(6)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the community development department access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this chapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter. 
(7)  If the community development department has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.

(d)  Method of calculation. 
(1)  Any development impact fee imposed pursuant to this ordinance shall not exceed a project's proportionate share of the cost of system improvements, shall be calculated on the basis of the establishment of service areas, and shall be calculated on the basis of levels of service for public facilities that are the same for existing development as for new growth and development, as established in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan. 
(2)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this ordinance, the calculation of impact fees shall be net of the present value of ad valorem tax or other revenues. Such revenues shall be as established in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan, and are those which: 
a.  Are reasonably expected to be generated by new development; and 
b.  Are reasonably expected on the basis of historical funding patterns to be made available to pay for system improvements of the same category and in the same service area for which an impact fee is imposed. 
(3)  The method of calculating impact fees for public facilities under this ordinance shall be maintained for public inspection as a part of the official records of Spalding County, and may be amended from time to time by official act. 
(4)  In addition to the cost of new or expanded system improvements needed to be built to serve new development, the cost basis of a development impact fee shall also include the proportionate cost of existing system improvements to the extent that such public facilities have excess service capacity and new development will be served by such facilities. 
(5)  Development impact fees shall be based on actual system improvement costs or reasonable estimates of such costs, as set forth in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan. 
(Ord. No. 2005-01, § 4, 1-18-05) 
Sec. 8-6005. - Fee assessment and payment. 
(a)  Fee schedule. 
(1)  Payment of a development impact fee pursuant to the fee schedule attached to Ordinance No. 2005-01 as Attachment A for a property located inside of Spalding County, shall constitute full and complete payment of the project's proportionate share of system improvements and shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this ordinance. 
(2)  When a land development activity for which an application for a building permit has been made includes two (2) or more buildings, structures or other land uses in any combination, including two (2) or more uses within a building or structure, the total development impact fee shall be the sum of the fees for each and every building, structure, or use, including each and every use within a building or structure. 
(3)  In the event that an applicant contends that the land use category of the proposed development is not shown on the fee schedule or fits within a different category, then: 
a.  The administrator in his or her sole discretion shall make a determination as to the appropriate land use designation and the appropriate development impact fee. 
b.  In making such determination, the administrator may require such additional information from the applicant as necessary to form a logical fee determination relative to the impact fees shown on the adopted fee schedule. 
c.  If a land use designation is not in a category contained in this ordinance, then an appropriate new category may be added by the administrator and an appropriate fee established under the county's current impact fee methodology, subject to annual confirmation by the board of commissioners. 
d.  Appeals from the decision of the administrator shall be made to the board of commissioners within thirty (30) days of the administrator's decision. 
(b)  Timing of assessment and payment. 
(1)  Development impact fees shall be assessed at the time of application for a building permit. 
(2)  All development impact fees shall be collected no later than the time of issuance of a building permit. 
(3)  For projects not involving issuance of a building permit, all development impact fees shall be collected at the time of approval of the development permit or such other authorization to commence construction or to commence use of a property. 
(4)  If the final use of a building cannot be determined at the time of the initial building permit, the administrator shall have the authority to assess a development impact fee based on the most likely use of the building, and shall adjust the fee in accordance with the actual use prior to issuance of an interior finishes permit or approval of a certificate of occupancy. An adjustment may result in a refund to the feepayor or payment of the marginal increase of the adjusted fee over the amount already paid. 
(5)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this ordinance, any future change in demand for public facilities in excess of the average demand anticipated at the time of issuance of the building permit shall be assessed such additional fee as would otherwise have been due. Future changes in demand may result from a change in the land use category of the occupant of the building or property, the expansion of a building or use on a property that results in an increase in the units of development (as defined herein), or the subsequent discovery of facts unknown or misrepresented at the time of issuance of the building permit. 
(c)  Individual assessment determinations. Individual assessments of development impact fees may be established as follows: 
(1)  At their option, an applicant for development approval may petition the administrator for an individual assessment determination of development impact fees due for their project. 
(2)  In the event that an applicant elects an individual assessment, the applicant shall submit an individual assessment study. Each individual assessment study shall: 
a.  Be based on relevant and credible information from an accepted standard source of engineering or planning data; or, 
b.  Be based on actual, relevant, and credible studies or surveys of facility demand conducted in Spalding County or its region, carried out by qualified engineers or planners pursuant to accepted methodology; and,

Payment of such an approved individual assessment determination shall constitute full and complete payment of the project's proportionate share of system improvements and shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this ordinance. 
(d)  Fee certification. Upon application to the administrator, a developer may receive a certified schedule of development impact fees for categories of development or a certified fee for a particular project, as applicable. Such certified schedule or fee shall establish the development impact fee due for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of certification, even if new or revised rate schedules are adopted in the interim. 
(Ord. No. 2005-01, § 5, 1-18-05) 
Sec. 8-6006. - Exemptions. 
(a)  Exemption policy. Spalding County recognizes that certain development projects provide extraordinary benefit in support of the economic advancement of the county's citizens over and above the access to jobs, goods and services that such uses offer in general. Spalding County therefore intends to encourage extraordinary economic development and employment growth of public benefit, as more fully defined and incorporated in the Spalding County Economic Incentives Program. 
(b)  Exemption criteria. 
(1)  The board of commissioners will favorably consider waiving the development impact fee in whole or in part for a business or development project that represents extraordinary economic development and employment growth upon the recommendation of the Spalding County Development Authority based on job-creation and investment criteria established in the economic incentives program.

(b)  Credits; restrictions. 
(1)  Except as provided in subsection (2) below, no credit shall be given for construction, contribution, or dedication of any system improvement or funds for system improvements made before the effective date of this ordinance. 
(2)  If the value of any construction, dedication of land, or contribution of money made by a developer (or his or her predecessor in title or interest) for system improvements that are included for impact fee funding in the capital improvements element of Spalding County Comprehensive Plan, prior to the effective date of this ordinance, is greater than the impact fee that would otherwise have been paid for the project, then the developer shall be entitled to a credit for such excess construction, dedication, or funding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this ordinance, any credit due under this section shall not constitute a liability of Spalding County, and shall accrue to the developer to the extent of impact fees assessed for new development for the same category of system improvements within the same service area. 
(3)  In no event shall credit be given for project improvements, or for system improvements not included for impact fee funding in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan. 
(c)  Granting of credits. 
(1)  Credit shall be given for the present value of any construction of improvements, contribution or dedication of land, or payment of money by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest for system improvements of the same public facilities category and in the same service area for which a development impact fee is imposed, provided that: 
a.  The system improvement is included for impact fee funding in the capital improvements element of Spalding County Comprehensive Plan;

(2)  The credit allowed pursuant to this chapter shall not exceed the impact fee due for such system improvement unless a greater credit is allowed under a private agreement executed under the provisions of this ordinance. In the event that a developer enters into such a private agreement with Spalding County to construct, fund, or contribute system improvements such that the amount of the credit created is in excess of the impact fee which would otherwise have been paid for the development project, the developer shall be reimbursed for such excess construction, funding, or contribution from impact fees paid by other development located in the service area which is benefited by such improvements. 
(d)  Guidelines for credit valuation. Credits under this section shall be valued using the following guidelines: 
(1)  For the construction of any system improvements by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the county, the developer must present evidence satisfactory to the administrator of the original cost of the improvement, from which present value may be calculated. 
(2)  For any contribution or dedication of land for system improvements by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the county, the original value of the land shall be the same as that attributed to the property by the validated tax appraisal at the time of dedication, from which present value may be calculated. 
(3)  For any contribution of capital equipment that qualifies as a system improvement by a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest and accepted by the county, the value shall be the original cost to the developer of the capital equipment or the cost that Spalding County would normally pay for such equipment, whichever is less. 
(4)  For any contribution of money for system improvements from a developer or his or her predecessor in title or interest accepted by the county, the original value of the money shall be the same as that at the time of contribution, from which present value may be calculated. 
(5)  In making a present value calculation, the discount rate used shall be the net of the interest returned on a State of Georgia, AA-rated or better municipal bond less average annual inflation, or such other discount rate as the board of commissioners in its sole discretion may deem appropriate. 
(e)  Credits; application. 
(1)  Credits shall be given only upon written request of the developer to the administrator. A developer must present written evidence satisfactory to the administrator at or before the time of development impact fee assessment.

(3)  Any credit approved by the administrator shall be acknowledged in writing by the administrator and calculated at the time of impact fee assessment. 
(f)  Credits; abandoned building permits. In the event that an impact fee is paid but the building permit is abandoned, credit shall be given for the present value of the impact fee against future impact fees for the same parcel of land, upon submission of adequate evidence to the administrator that an impact fee was received by the county, the amount paid, and that the building permit was abandoned.

b.  The development impact fee has not been encumbered or construction has not been commenced within six (6) years after the date the fee was collected. 
(2)  In determining whether development impact fees have been encumbered, development impact fees shall be considered encumbered on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. 
(b)  Notice of entitlement to a refund. When the right to a refund exists due to a failure to encumber the development impact fees, the administrator shall provide written notice of entitlement to a refund to the feepayor who paid the development impact fee at the address shown on the application for development approval or to a successor in interest who has given adequate notice to the administrator of a legal transfer or assignment of the right to entitlement to a refund and who has provided a mailing address. Such notice shall also be published in Spalding County within thirty (30) days after the expiration of the six-year period after the date that the development impact fee was collected and shall contain a heading "Notice of Entitlement to Development Impact Fee Refund." No refund shall be made for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of said publication. 
(c)  Filing a request for a refund. All requests for refunds shall be made in writing to the administrator within one (1) year of the time the refund becomes payable or within one (1) year of publication of the notice of entitlement to a refund, whichever is later.

Such funds together with the accrued interest thereon shall be transferred to the general revenue account of Spalding County. 
(d)  Payment of refunds. 
(1)  All refunds shall be made to the feepayor within sixty (60) days after it is determined by the administrator that a sufficient proof of claim for refund has been made, but no sooner than thirty (30) days after publication of the notice of entitlement to the refund.

(a)  General. 
(1)  Applications must be verified before final approvals are given. Approval will be in writing with copies to all interested parties. 
(2)  Indigent cases, except emergencies, must be approved before admission to hospital. There will be no retroactive approvals except emergencies. 
(3)  Emergency cases must be reported to approving agent within twenty-four (24) hours after admission to the hospital if they are considered for approval as indigent, except when emergency cases enter the hospital on a Saturday or a Sunday. Such Saturday or Sunday cases must be submitted to the approving agent for investigation by 9:00 a.m. on the following Tuesday. 
(4)  Except in the case of approvals for "outpatient" treatment, each hospital admission as an indigent will require a separate application and approval. 
(5)  An "indigent" person as used herein shall be construed to mean any person, residing in Spalding County, who is ill or injured and is in need of hospital care and who from his own resources or from the resources of those upon whom he is legally dependent, is financially unable to meet the full costs of hospital care as prescribed or ordered by a physician. An allegedly indigent person shall not be considered "indigent" hereunder if any of the following conditions exist: 
a.  If either he or a person upon whom he is legally dependent is financially able to pay for his hospital care and, in any case, only to the extent of such hospital care for which he or those upon whom he is legally dependent are unable to pay; 
b.  If he or any one (1) or more of those upon whom he is legally dependent own a home or have an equity in a home, exceeding twenty-five hundred dollars ($2,500.00); 
c.  If he owns a motor vehicle or an equity therein which has a market value in excess of five hundred dollars ($500.00); or 
d.  If he has a stereo-record player, a television set, a motorcycle, an airplane, or other such items, which may be considered nonessential by the governing authority of Spalding County, having a market value in aggregate in excess of five hundred dollars ($500.00) or if he is making installment payments for the purchase of any such items. 
(b)  Insurance. 
(1)  No portion of any hospital bill for hospital care furnished anyone shall be regarded as an indigent case to the extent covered by any type of insurance or any federal, state, or other local programs for such indigent person. 
(2)  The term "hospital care" as used herein shall be construed to mean only the nonprofit, basic costs of hospital care needed for the treatment for the ill or injured, as deemed necessary and ordered by the physician in charge of the case in accordance with the rules, regulations and standards adopted and promulgated by the hospital, and shall be only the hospital care that is not available under any other program, federal, state or local. 
(c)  Pregnancy. 
(1)  As a general rule, pregnancy or childbirth will not be approved as an indigent case because there is ample time to make some arrangements to handle the financial obligation. If such a patient is clearly to be an indigent case, it must be reported by the doctor, patient or health clinic at least three (3) months in advance or as soon as the initial contact is made between the patient and the doctor or health clinic. 
(2)  No illegitimate pregnancy or childbirth will be approved as indigent unless the doctor, health clinic and/or the hospital notifies the approving agent in strict accordance with the above paragraph (1); and, further, that cooperation is extended to bring the putative father to justice by making him face his financial obligation under the law, and that the expectant mother swears out a warrant against the man she names as the father of the child. The county investigator should be called for assistance in-these cases. 
(d)  Doctors. Spalding County assumes no liability for physicians' bills or hospital resident physicians' fees.

(Ord. No. 2009-07, § 1, 6-15-09) 
Sec. 9-3101. - Purpose. 
It is recognized that certain existing buildings, dwellings, structures and properties within Spalding County are unfit for human habitation. Such buildings, dwellings, structures or properties that exist in a substandard and deteriorating condition cause or contribute to the general decline and deterioration in appearance of property and property values of surrounding properties in the general neighborhood. Such buildings, dwellings, structure or properties that exist in an unsanitary or unsafe condition render the properties unsafe, unsanitary, dangerous and detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of those residing therein or in the general vicinity thereof. Vacant buildings and dwellings also exist within Spalding County which, as a result of their vacancy, are subject to unauthorized entry and vandalism. Vacant buildings and dwellings are often used for criminal activity and subject to vagrant use which increases the risk of fire, safety and sanitation hazards. The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum standards for the maintenance of decent housing and properties, to provide for the maintenance of all properties within Spalding County in a safe and habitable condition and to provide effective means of enforcement thereof. Further, the purpose of this Code is to establish standards and procedures for the protection of the neighborhood residents and the general public. The provisions of this Code shall be mandatory for all buildings and dwellings designed or intended for human habitation whether occupied or vacant.

(c)  Interior violations. When a building or dwelling is vacant, violations of this Code pertinent to interior conditions shall be held in abeyance for a period not to exceed six (6) months, provided that the exterior of such building or dwelling complies with the provision of this Code and the interior has been cleaned of trash, rubbish and debris; and the building or dwelling has been made inaccessible by boarding.

Editor's note— An Ordinance of Jan. 4, 1994, adopted new zoning regulations for the county as herein set out and repealed the prior zoning and building regulations formerly included in this Code as Ch. 1 of Part VIII of Div. 2. In order to accommodate the style and format of these new regulations, the editor has included the provisions of the Ord. of Jan. 4, 1994 as a new Appendix IV. An additional Ordinance adopted on Sept. 27, 1994, amended the Zoning Ordinance by the addition of Article 19. Ordinances subsequent to the Ord. of Sept. 19, 1994, which amend these zoning regulations will be indicated by the addition of a parenthetical history note following the amended section. The lack of such a note indicates that the section derives unamended from the Ord. of Jan. 4, 1994, including the Ordinance of Sept. 19, 1994, and any prior amendments. 
 The county has grouped together ordinances relating to development as "uniform development ordinances." These uniform development ordinances have been added to the Zoning Ordinance as appendices as follows: Spalding County Subdivision Ordinance—Appendix A, Ordinance Establishing Spalding County Planning Commission—Appendix B, Ordinance Establishing Spalding County Board of Appeals—Appendix C, Spalding County Soil and Sedimentation Control Ordinance—Appendix D, Spalding County Sign Ordinance—Appendix E, Spalding County Flood Damage Prevention Ordinances—Appendix F, Standards for Off-Street Parking and Service Facilities—Appendix G.

Sec. 302. - Districts explained. 
A.  Districts are areas of land within Spalding County to which different development requirements and standards are applied. These differences are intended to promote the separation of incompatible uses, encourage sound land use patterns, and retain the character of the community. Although this ordinance establishes the locations of districts as indicated on the official map, a district may be changed in the future in order to meet changing needs. 
B.  In making the decision to change a district, the points contained in section 414 must be considered by the planning commission as well as the board of commissioners. 
ARTICLE 4. - GENERAL PROCEDURES 

Sec. 401. - Initial information. 
A.  Article 4 outlines the procedures to be followed in order to comply with the requirements of this ordinance. Initial information about the ordinance may be obtained from the administrative officer. 
B.  The administrative officer will provide and maintain copies of the ordinance for review and/or sale. 
Sec. 402. - Compliance with zoning ordinance required. 
A.  No building is to be erected, used, occupied, moved, or altered in a manner that does not conform to the requirements specified for the district in which it is located. 
B.  The only exception to this requirement is that all buildings or uses which lawfully existed at a particular location at the time this ordinance was adopted may be continued but only, as provided in section 403, "Continuance of non-conforming uses." 
Sec. 402A. - Certificate of zoning compliance. 
A.  To determine whether a structure or use existing or proposed for any property located within Spalding County is or may be used or developed in compliance with this ordinance, the owner of the property or his agent may request a certificate of zoning compliance from the zoning administrator. Such request shall be in writing and on such forms as may be developed for such purpose, which shall minimally meet the following standards: 
1.  Identification of the owner of the subject property; 
2.  Identification of any agent of the owner of the subject property; 
3.  A legal description of the subject property; 
4.  A complete description and inventory of all existing structures on the subject property; 
5.  A complete description and inventory of all proposed structures proposed or to be located on the subject property under this ordinance and for which the certificate of zoning compliance is being requested; 
6.  A complete description and inventory of any and all activities presently occurring; and 
7.  A complete description and inventory of any and all activities proposed to occur on the subject property and for which the certificate of zoning compliance is being requested. 
B.  The zoning administrator or his representative shall respond in writing within ten (10) business days of receipt of a request for a certificate of zoning compliance. 
C.  The issuance of the certificate of zoning compliance shall be confirmation that the structures and/or uses located on or proposed for the subject property have been determined to be in compliance with the zoning ordinance of Spalding County and may be legally conducted thereon as of the date of issuance of the certificate. 
D.  In absence of a certificate of zoning compliance, no representation by any official or employee of Spalding County shall in any way legally bind Spalding County or in any way constitute any determination that the structures and/or uses located on or proposed for the subject property are in compliance with the zoning ordinance of Spalding County, or any appendix thereto nor shall any owner of property within Spalding County or his agent, successor or assign, claim any vested right to maintain or construct any structure and/or conduct any use located on or proposed for the subject property. 
E.  Any certificate of zoning compliance issued hereunder shall be valid for a period of thirty (30) days, within which period the applicant must make further application to commence or conduct the uses requested within the application for a certificate of zoning compliance or construct any structure(s) identified in the application for a certificate of zoning compliance. 
(Res. of 8-5-97, § 1) 
Sec. 403. - Continuance of non-conforming uses. 
Invariably, at the time a land use and development control ordinance is adopted or amended, certain uses which lawfully existed prior to the adoption or amendment will not conform to the regulations and standards for the districts in which they are located. These are known as non-conforming uses, and in order to feasibly adopt the ordinance and so as not to cause undue economic hardship on owners of non-conforming uses, these uses are allowed to continue under special conditions as outlined in the following parts of this section: 
A.  Where a non-conforming use of a building or lot has ceased for more than twelve (12) consecutive months and any part of that twelve-month period occurs after the adoption of this ordinance or where a nonconforming use has changed to a permitted or conforming use, further use of the building or lot shall be in conformance with the standards and requirements for the district in which it is located. 
B.  A non-conforming use shall not be extended or altered unless the extension or alteration is in conformance with the requirements of this ordinance. 
C.  A non-conforming use which is altered or extended shall meet applicable Spalding County building codes and development regulations. When an applicant seeks a building permit for the extension or alteration of a nonconforming use, the building official and the administrative officer will inspect the unit and determine what (if anything) is needed to bring the unit into conformance with applicable building codes and development regulations. Upon determining that the unit meets applicable building codes and development regulations, he will issue the building permit for the non-conforming use. 
D.  A non-conforming structure may be repaired, maintained and, in case of destruction, replaced, so long as any such repair, maintenance or replacement does not in any way increase its nonconformity, and it remains otherwise lawful. 
Sec. 404. - Height of fences and walls in a residential zoning district. 
A.  No fence shall exceed six (6) feet in height above the adjoining ground level. No fence located in a front yard (as defined in section 202.VVV) shall exceed four (4) feet in height above the ground level on property zoned AR-1, AR-2, R-1A, R-1, R-2A, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6, C-1, C-1A, PDD, VN, AAR, PRRRD and O&I. 
B.  No fence shall encroach into the public right-of-way. 
C.  Barbed wire or other sharp, pointed fence material shall be allowed on property zoned AR-1 and AR-2 for purpose of livestock constraint. 
D.  Barbed wire or other sharp, pointed fence material shall be allowed on property zoned C-1B, C-1C, C-2 and C-3. 
(Res. No. A-09-04, §§ 1, 2, 3-16-09) 
Sec. 405. - Required buffers in commercial and industrial districts. 
In any commercial or industrial zoning district where a lot abuts any residential district or any adjacent residential use, a twenty-five-foot wide buffer shall be provided with screening as specified in section 407. Off-street parking associated with such uses shall be governed by this same provision. 
Sec. 406. - Screening of service areas within one hundred feet of public street. 
Any service area, loading area, refuse, or storage area between a principal building and a public street being visible from said street and lying within one hundred (100) feet of said street shall be provided with screening as specified in section 407, if within any commercial or manufacturing district. 
Sec. 407. - Screening required. 
Whenever screening is required by this ordinance, a durable masonry wall, or fence and hedge of sufficient opacity to provide a visual blind designed to be compatible with the character of adjoining properties, shall be provided. Such fences and/or walls shall be at least six (6) feet in height, but no greater than eight (8) feet in height, measured from the ground along the common lot lines of the adjoining properties. When hedges or natural plantings are used (together with the fence prescribed) to form the required screening, the minimum sufficient opacity shall be deemed to require no less than three (3) feet of plantings and/or hedge in the area immediately adjacent to the fence, measured along the ground surface from the fence to the inside border of said plantings and/or hedge plantings. Hedges of comparable natural plantings shall be of such variety that an average height of at least six (6) feet could be expected by normal growth within no later than two (2) years from the time of planting. At the time of the application for a building permit, the applicant shall post a performance bond in the amount sufficient to cover the cost of installation of the required screening. If at the end of the two-year period the buffered screening is satisfactorily in place as prescribed in this section, the amount of the bond shall be returned to the applicant; however, if the required screening is not completed satisfactorily as set forth in this section by the end of the two-year period, the bond shall be deemed forfeited and the required screening will be installed by Spalding County, using the funds from the proceeds of the cash bond posted by the applicant. At the time of the application for a building permit, the applicant shall grant an easement with Spalding County on and over the land site for which application has been made, sufficient to allow Spalding County to enter onto the property and perform the required screening work. Said easement onto the land shall be recorded in the Spalding County Superior Court clerk's office and remain on record at least until the screening is deemed to meet the requirements of this section 407. The administrative officer shall make determination of the degree of satisfactory completion of required screening according to a common standard; the administrative officer's decisions in each instance may be appealed to the board of appeals. When a favorable determination that requirements have been completed is made by the administrative officer, the county will execute a quitclaim or other conveyance of interest revoking the easement to the land owner of record. 
Sec. 408. - Building permit required. 
A.  The developer or other person wishing to do any of the following must first apply to the building official for a building permit: 
1.  Excavation or filling of a lot for the construction of a building. 
2.  Erection, movement or demolition of a building, greater than one hundred twenty (120) square feet gross floor area. 
3.  Enlargement or other work on an existing building where it is determined by the building official that inspection of the work is necessary. The building official shall maintain a list of work that requires a permit within his office. 
4.  Installation of a manufactured home or industrialized building. 
B.  No electrical service will be made available to the site of new construction until a building permit is secured. 
C.  The building permit must be applied for either by the owner of the land upon which the proposed building or alteration is to be located, or by the contractor doing the work. 
D.  The applicant may obtain a building permit application from the building official. He should complete the application form and submit it to the building official, together with any supporting documentation which the building official may specify. 
E.  No application will be accepted from any person who is in violation of the zoning ordinance. If an applicant for a building permit is, at the time of such an application, determined by the building official to be in violation of the zoning ordinance, then the building official will be prohibited from accepting or processing any application from that applicant until the applicant voluntarily removes or changes the cause of the violation and ceases to be in violation. The applicant must notify the building official that he has ceased the violation and obtain a release from the administrative officer as to the violation. 
F.  When the applicant has ceased to be in violation of this ordinance, the building official will then accept the application for building permit. 
G.  Before a building permit is issued by the building official, the Spalding County Health Department must approve the proposed water supply and sewage disposal facilities required in connection with the proposed building or structure. In areas served by a public water and sewage system, the health department may elect to waive the requirement for approval. After study of the site of a proposed use, the health department may require for health reasons that all or any portion of the site not be used for the intended purpose. The health department may also set a minimum lot size larger than that required by this ordinance. The county health department will either approve or disapprove the water and sewer facilities within thirty (30) days of receipt of the application from the administrative officer, providing a written decision, including reasons for the decision. 
H.  Except as otherwise provided by this ordinance, an existing use which is altered or extended must meet applicable uniform development ordinances and standards as adopted by the county. Information about applicable development ordinances and standards may be obtained from the building official. 
I.  The building official is in charge of issuing building permits. The building permit will be issued if, upon review of the application, the building official is satisfied that the proposed project can meet the requirements of this ordinance and all other applicable ordinances. The building official may require the submission of additional information in order to determine if the proposed project meets the requirements of this ordinance. 
J.  If the building official determines that the proposed project as presented in the building permit application will not satisfy the requirements of this ordinance, he will not issue a building permit. He will notify the applicant in writing within ten (10) days of the submission of the application, stating reasons for the refusal. The applicant will then need to confer with the building official to determine what he needs to do in order to comply with the ordinance and be eligible for a building permit. 
K.  Work or construction authorized by a permit must commence within one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of issuance. The building official may grant an extension of time in which to commence work or construction for an additional one hundred eighty (180) days, upon written request and a showing of justifiable cause. Any extension granted by the building official shall be documented in writing. In the event work is not commenced within the time authorized, the permit shall be void. If construction has begun on an approved project and then ceases before the project has been completed, construction must restart within twelve (12) months from the time that it was stopped or the permit will become invalid and a new one must be applied for if construction of the project is desired to resume at a future date. Records of the building permits, applications and supporting materials will be maintained by the building official. 
L.  All newly constructed buildings, as well as additions, extensions or enlargements of structures must comply with all building codes in effect in Spalding County. The building official will explain the procedures and timing of inspections to determine if work meets applicable codes. 
M.  The building official may revoke any building permit where there has been any false statement or misrepresentation as to a material fact or condition in the application or plans on which the permit was based, and upon such revocation, all construction, improvements or alterations as authorized by such permit or approval, shall cease until a valid building permit is issued. 
N.  The demolition and removal of a building as defined herein shall require a demolition permit. Such permit shall be valid for a period of ninety (90) days. The permittee shall be required, as part of the demolition project to remove all structure remnants, materials, debris, junk and equipment from the demolition site. The permittee shall also be required to meet soil erosion and sedimentation control requirements, including the permanent re-vegetation of the site. 
O.  The demolition and removal of a building as defined herein that has been issued a notice of violation per the Spalding County Minimum Housing and Standards Code shall require a demolition permit. Such permit shall be valid for a period of thirty (30) days. The permittee shall be required, as part of the demolition project, to remove all structure remnants, materials, debris, junk and equipment from the demolition site. The permittee shall also be required to meet soil erosion and sedimentation control requirements, including the permanent re-vegetation of the site. The remodel or repair of any structure issued a notice of violation per the Spalding County Minimum Housing and Standards Code shall require a building permit and submittal of an action plan to be approved by the building official.

Sec. 408'. - Reserved. 
Editor's note— Res. No. A-13-02, § 1, adopted Sept. 16, 2013, repealed § 408', which pertained to exemption from permit fee and derived from Res. No. A-10-08, § 1, 12-20-10. 
Sec. 409. - Certificate of occupancy required. 
A.  Certificate of occupancy is required before a structure for which a building permit has been issued or where a change in use of the building has occurred may be occupied or used. The certificate of occupancy must be signed by the administrative officer and attest that to the best of his knowledge all requirements of this ordinance have been met. The owner/contractor will then receive the certificate of occupancy to be used as confirmation that he has complied with the provisions of this ordinance. 
B.  The administrative officer will issue the certificate of occupancy upon notification by the building official that all applicable building codes and other uniform development standards and ordinances have been met. However, if the building official finds that all requirements of such ordinances have not yet been met when the owner/contractor seeks a certificate of occupancy, the administrative officer will not issue the certificate of occupancy. The administrative officer will notify the owner/contractor within ten (10) days, stating reasons for the refusal. The owner/contractor will then need to confer with the administrative officer to determine what he needs to do in order to comply with the ordinance and be eligible for a certificate of occupancy. 
C.  Certificate of completion may be issued by the building official to construction projects where the building of the structure is complete, but interior alteration or build-out may be proposed prior to occupancy. A structure or a portion of a structure receiving a certificate of completion shall not be occupied until the certificate of occupancy for the same is issued. 
D.  Notice of approval may be issued by the building official to confirm that a particular system (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, etc.) has passed the prescribed inspections and tests necessary for the operation of such system. 
E.  A temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued by the administrative official for a period not exceeding six (6) months during alterations or partial occupancy of a building pending its completion, provided that such temporary certificate shall include such conditions and safeguards as will protect the safety of the occupants and the public. Only industrial projects exceeding twenty thousand (20,000) square feet of building area are eligible for a temporary certificate of occupancy.

Editor's note— Res. No. A-11-06, § 2, adopted Sept. 19, 2011, repealed the former section and enacted a new section as set out herein. The former section pertained to similar subject matter. 
Sec. 410. - Appealing an action of the administrative officer or building official. 
A.  If the administrative officer or building official executes an action which the aggrieved party believes to be contrary to this ordinance, that action may be appealed. Such an appeal must be filed within thirty (30) days of the date on which the action by the administrative officer or building official was taken. 
B.  The board of appeals has jurisdiction for hearing appeals concerning actions of the administrative officer or building official related to this ordinance. Applications for appeal may be obtained from and submitted to the administrative officer, who will transmit them to the board of appeals for its consideration. 
C.  When an action of the administrative officer or building official is appealed, all construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action must be stopped immediately. In certain cases, however, the building official may feel that the stopping of such construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action will cause imminent peril to life or property. Then, the building official may certify to the board of appeals that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, the halting of construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action would in his opinion cause imminent peril to life or property. In such cases, the construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action is allowed to continue unless the construction is halted by the board of appeals or a restraining order is granted by a court of competent jurisdiction. 
D.  When an application for appeal of an action of the administrative officer or building official is received, the board of appeals will set a time and place for a public hearing on the appeal. Notice of the hearing must be published in a newspaper of general circulation in Spalding County at least fifteen (15) days before the hearing. In addition, the parties to the appeal will be notified of the date of the hearing by the board of appeals by certified mail with return receipt requested and postmarked at least fifteen (15) days before the hearing. Any person may appear at the hearing, or have a representative attend instead. 
E.  The board of appeals will make a decision concerning the appeal and record the decision in the minutes for that meeting. Any person aggrieved by a decision by the board of appeals may petition the Spalding County Superior Court for a writ of certiorari. 
Sec. 411. - Variances. 
A.  A variance is a permit, issued by the board of appeals, which allows use of a parcel of land in a way that varies from the requirements for the district in which the property is located. A variance may be granted only in an individual, specific case under such circumstances as will not be contrary to the public interest where, due to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance will result in practical difficulty (as distinguished from mere inconvenience) or unnecessary hardship so that the spirit of this ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. 
A variance may not be granted for the use of a parcel, building or structure that is prohibited by this ordinance. 
A variance may not be granted based on circumstances created by the applicant, such as: 
1.  The purchase of a parcel with knowledge of an existing restriction; 
2.  A claim of hardship based on prospective sales; or 
3.  An expressed economic need, when such need can be met in other ways which would not require a variance. 
The board of appeals shall, in granting a variance, determine that: 
1.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular parcel because of its size, shape, location and topography; 
2.  Application of this ordinance to the particular parcel would create a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship on the property owner; 
3.  Such conditions are peculiar and unique to the particular parcel; 
4.  The variance, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purpose and intent of this ordinance; 
5.  A literal interpretation of this ordinance would deprive the applicant of any rights that others owning property within the same zoning classification are allowed; 
6.  The variance, if granted, shall not go beyond the minimum necessary to afford relief and does not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties within the same zoning classification; 
7.  The variance may be granted with such conditions imposed as may be necessary to protect the health, safety, welfare and general value of the property in the general neighborhood; and 
8.  Granting the variance shall not be based on consideration of any existing nonconforming uses on nearby parcels and no permitted use of any parcel in any other zoning classification. 
B.  Relief from the hardship—the variance—must not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes of this ordinance. 
C.  When a variance is issued, the spirit of this ordinance must be observed and the public safety and welfare secured. A variance may be granted only for permitted uses in the zoning district in which the property in question is located. (For example, a two-family dwelling would not be allowed to be placed in an R-1 district under a variance). 
D.  The developer or owner wishing to request a variance must have at least fifty-one (51) percent ownership of the subject property or be the duly authorized agent of such a person, possessing notarized authorization in writing, under the owner's signature. The planning commission or board of commissioners may also propose a variance. However, the power to approve a variance rests with the board of appeals, except that in consideration of a rezoning of property from one zoning district to another, the board of commissioners may approve a variance in connection with its approval of a conditional rezoning. 
E.  Application for a variance may be made with the administrative officer. The administrative officer will take the required information and transmit it to the board of appeals for its consideration. No application is to be accepted from any person in violation of the zoning ordinance. If an applicant for a variance or any other action by the board of appeals is, at the time of such application, determined by the administrative officer to be in violation of the zoning ordinance, then the administrative officer will be prohibited from accepting or processing any application from that applicant until the applicant voluntarily removes or changes the cause of the violation and ceases to be in violation. The applicant must notify the administrative officer that he has ceased the violation and obtain a release from the administrative officer as to the violation. 
F.  When the applicant has ceased to be in violation of this ordinance, the administrative officer will then accept the application for variance. 
G.  When an application for a variance is received, the board of appeals will set a time and place for a public hearing on the variance. Notice of the hearing must be published in a newspaper of general circulation in Spalding County at least fifteen (15) days before the hearing. Such notice will state the application number, owner's name, property location, its area, time, place and subject of the hearing. At least fifteen (15) days before the public hearing, notice of the time, place, and subject of the hearing will be sent to the appellant or petitioner in writing by U.S. Mail to his last known address. Copies of all such letters will be maintained in the applicant's file. 
H.  The board of appeals will make a decision concerning the variance and record the decision in the minutes for that meeting. 
I.  The board of appeals may impose any other conditions which must be complied with by the applicant to compensate for the requirements varied from. 
J.  The board of appeals may establish performance bonds to assure compliance with any requirements it has set for granting a variance. Where a variance is granted for a construction activity requiring a building permit, the building permit must be obtained and construction must begin within six (6) months of the issuance of the variance. Otherwise, the Variance expires after six (6) months. 
K.  Any person aggrieved by a decision of the board of appeals on an application for a variance may petition the Spalding County superior court for a writ of certiorari. 
(Res. No. A-05-06, §§ 1, 2, 6-20-05) 
Sec. 412. - Reserved. 
Sec. 413. - Special exceptions. 
A.  Some zoning districts permit certain uses only upon approval of the board of commissioners, following preliminary review by the board of appeals. These uses are identified in this ordinance as special exceptions and in each case carry specific circumstances under which the use should or should not be allowed. 
B.  The developer or owner wishing to request a special exception must have at least fifty-one (51) percent ownership of the subject property or be the duly authorized agent of such a person, possessing notarized authorization in writing, under the owner's signature. The planning commission or board of commissioners may also propose a special exception. However, the power to approve a special exception rests with the board of commissioners. 
C.  Application for a special exception may be made with the administrative officer. The administrative officer will take the required information and transmit it to the board of appeals for its consideration. No application is to be accepted from any person in violation of the zoning ordinance. If an applicant for special exception or any other action by the board of appeals is, at the time of such an application, determined by the administrative officer to be in violation of the zoning ordinance, then the administrative officer will be prohibited from accepting or processing any application from that applicant until the applicant voluntarily removes or changes the cause of the violation and ceases to be in violation.

This application must be supported by a site development plan and a written plan of intent. The relationship between the proposed development and the surrounding area, both existing and proposed, must be shown. Eight (8) copies of the site development plan and written plan of intent must accompany the application. The site development plan shall consist of a series of drawings which must show the following: 
a.  A general location map. 
b.  The site development plan shall be drawn at a scale suitable to show the extent of the proposed development. North arrow and correct scale will be shown on all drawings. Scales of 1″=100′ are acceptable.

This is because R-6 districts are created only upon request of a developer, whose application materials demonstrate a firm commitment to construction of a well-designed R-6 development. Upon approval of the R-6 zoning, existing zoning must be changed to an R-6 zone which is an amendment to the ordinance. The amendment procedures contained in sections 414 and 2302 must be followed in granting the amendment to permit the R-6 development. Approval of R-6 zoning shall in every instance be conditioned by the site development plan approved by the board of commissioners.

a.  Written notice of consent to the modifications. 
b.  Properly revised site development plans. 
3.  The official map will then be changed (section 2302). The site plan and supporting information of any approved plan will be properly identified and permanently filed with the administrative officer. 
4.  No building permits will be issued by the building official until the development plan has been approved by the board of commissioners. 
D.  Issuance of building permits: The administrative officer will issue building permits for buildings and structures in the area covered by the approved development plan if the proposed buildings and structures are in conformity with the approved development plan, the development schedule, and all other applicable regulations. (See: Section 408.) 
E.  Revision of development plan after approval of plan: 
1.  Minor extensions, alterations, or modifications of existing buildings or structures may be permitted after review and approval of the planning commission; such changes must be consistent with the purposes and intent of the development plan. 
2.  Any major or substantial change in the approved development plan which affects the intent and character of the development, the density of land use pattern, the location or dimensions of streets, or similar substantial changes must be reviewed and approved by the board of commissioners after receipt of recommendations from the planning commission in accordance with the provisions of sections 414 and 2302. A request for a revision of the development plan must be supported by a written statement indicating the nature of the revision and the reasons it is considered necessary or desirable to revise the development.

ARTICLE 14A. - C-1C MANUFACTURING—LIGHT[6] 

Footnotes: 
--- (6) --- 
Editor's note— Section 1 of a resolution adopted Mar. 4, 1997, renumbered this article, which was formerly numbered Art. 14, C-1B Manufacturing-Light, §§ 1401—1404, as Art. 14A, C-1C Manufacturing-Light, §§ 1401A—1404A. 

Sec. 1401A. - Purpose. 
C-1C zoning districts are intended to establish and preserve physically and aesthetically desirable areas in which clean, low-intensity manufacturing activities may locate and be protected from the intrusion of incompatible land uses. By having such areas available, both new and existing industries may operate and undertake expansion of facilities with the least possible adverse effect on other types of activities which might be incompatible with manufacturing. The elimination of non-manufacturing activities from C-1C districts benefits manufacturing activities by removing some possible obstacles to their smooth operation and expansion.

The VN district is established to provide development design criteria and standards for comprehensive and coordinated development of areas identified on the Spalding County Future Land Use Map (a part of the Spalding County Comprehensive Plan) as being appropriate for greater residential densities and mixed-use development. The VN district encourages flexible site plans and building arrangements under a unified plan of development for retail, commercial and service uses for self-sufficient neighborhoods and to encourage and develop a sense of community. The VN district is established to provide a variety of residential development styles and community commercial services. 
The VN district encourages development of residences in areas surrounding and adjoining commercial property. The residential areas will consist of quality housing constructed in compliance with high construction standards which focus on aesthetic appearance and co-existence with nearby commercial property. The VN district will encourage development of flex (live/work) units which consist of multi-storied structures with commercial uses and/or living space. The commercial area within the VN district shall be composed principally of neighborhood and community related commercial uses requiring less than thirty thousand (30,000) square feet. The commercial area must be developed in a manner consistent with adjoining residential properties. 
The VN district encourages pedestrian access to commercial properties from residences. Retail centers shall be designed to provide pedestrian access from all areas of the village.

ARTICLE 18. - PRRRD PLANNED RESIDENTIAL AND RECREATIONAL RESORT DEVELOPMENT 

Sec. 1801. - Purpose. 
PRRRD districts are intended to establish and provide for a comprehensive planned unit development (PUD) which encourages the best possible site plans and building arrangement for residential and recreational use under a unified plan of development. Such developments are sensitive to, and take into consideration, interrelationships between the natural environment, different architectural styles, relative scales of various structures, and the larger community setting in which the PRRRD is situated. 
Sec. 1802. - Boundaries of PRRRD districts. 
The official map (section 2301 of this ordinance) shows the boundaries of all PRRRD districts within Spalding County. Article 23 also contains additional information concerning interpreting district boundaries, amending boundaries, etc.

(Res. No. A-19-02, § 26, 4-15-19) 
Sec. 1804. - Plan review and approval procedures. 
A.  Pre-application conference: Prior to filing a formal application for a PRRRD, the applicant shall confer with the administrative officer and the planning commission in order to review the general character of the plan (on the basis of tentative land use sketch if available), and to obtain information on development standards and ordinances affecting the proposed project. 
B.  Submission of application for PRRRD Approval and subsequent development of such rezoned property: 
1.  Conceptual site plan, to be submitted with the original rezoning application, to include: 
a.  A location map showing all principal arterial highways within two (2) miles of the proposed PRRRD property (no scale required).

C.  Review and approval of PRRRD application: 
1.  An application for approval of a PRRRD is treated as an application for an amendment to this ordinance (rezoning). This is because PRRRD districts are created only upon request of a developer, whose application materials demonstrate a firm commitment to construction of a well designed PRRRD. Upon approval of the PRRRD, existing zoning must be changed to a PRRRD zone which is an amendment to the ordinance. The amendment procedures contained in sections 414 and 2302 must be followed in granting the amendment to permit the PRRRD. Approval of PRRRD zoning shall in every instance be conditioned by the site development plan approved by the board of commissioners.

b.  Properly revised site development plans. 
3.  The official map will then be changed (section 2302). The site plan and supporting information of any approved plan will be properly identified and permanently filed with the administrative officer. 
4.  No building permits will be issued by the building official until the development plan has been approved by the board of commissioners. 
D.  Issuance of building permits: The building official will issue building permits for buildings and structures in the area covered by the approved development plan if the proposed buildings and structures are in conformity with the approved development plan, the development schedule, and all other applicable regulations. (See section 408.) 
E.  Revision of development plan after approval of plan: 
1.  Minor extensions, alterations, or modifications of existing buildings or structures may be permitted after review and approval by the planning commission; such changes must be consistent with the purposes and intent of the development plan. 
2.  Any major or substantial change in the approved development plan which affects the intent and character of the development, the density of land use pattern, the location or dimensions of streets, or similar substantial changes must be reviewed and approved by the board of commissioners after receipt of recommendations from the planning commission in accordance with the provisions of sections 414 and 2302. A request for a revision of the development plan must be supported by a written statement indicating the nature of the revision and the reasons it is considered necessary or desirable to revise the development.

ARTICLE 20. - S-1 SENSITIVE LAND FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION[7] 

Footnotes: 
--- (7) --- 
Editor's note— Res. No. A-10-06, §§ 2, 3, adopted September 20, 2010, repealed and reenacted article 20 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, article 20, §§ 2001—2004 pertained to S-1 sensitive land—flood hazard, and derived from an ordinance of January 4, 1994. 

Sec. 2001. - Purpose and authorization. 
A.  Authorization. Pursuant to Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of 1983 and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a), Spalding County is authorized to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare to protect property from safety hazards on lands that are vulnerable to flooding. 
B.  Findings of fact. 
1.  Flood hazard areas of Spalding County, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
2.  These flood losses are caused by occupancy of structures located in flood hazard areas which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
C.  Statement of purpose. 
1.  S-1 is an overlay district which applies the additional standards of specific areas which may lie within any other zoning district in this ordinance. Both the regulations of S-1 and that district shall apply. In the event of a conflict, the more stringent provision shall prevail. 
2.  This ordinance promotes the public health, safety and general welfare by minimizing public and private losses due to flood conditions, periodic flooding and inundation in specific areas by: 
a.  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
b.  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
c.  Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; and 
d.  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
e.  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
D.  Objectives. The objectives of this ordinance are: 
1.  To protect human life and health; 
2.  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
3.  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
4.  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
5.  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
6.  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
7.  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

NOTE: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
NN.  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions: Where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
OO.  Variance: A grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this ordinance. 
PP.  Violation: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

10.  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this ordinance, shall be undertaken only if the non-conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
B.  Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
1.  New construction and/or substantial improvements. 
a.  Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 2005 A.4., "Elevated buildings." 
b.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. 
2.  Non-residential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 2004 C.6. 
3.  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. 
b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
i.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
ii.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) or no less than thirty-six (36) inches in height above grade. 
c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement (Ref. subsection 2005 A.6.). 
d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
i.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days. 
ii.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions), or 
iii.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections 2005 B.3.a.—c., above. 
4.  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in subsection 2003 A., are areas designated as a floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted, however, it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
b.  Only if subsection 2005 B.4.a. above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section. 
C.  Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-Zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in subsection 2003 A., where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-Zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
1.  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with subsection 2003 A., then the zoning administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of section 2005.

2.  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty (20) feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one-foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
a.  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. The lowest floor may be elevated one (1) foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-Zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 2005 A.4., "Elevated buildings." 
b.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
3.  The zoning administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
D.  Standards for areas of special flood hazard (Zones AE) with established base flood elevations without designated floodways. Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in subsection 2003 A., where streams with base flood elevations are provided but no floodways have been designated, (Zones AE) the following provisions apply: 
1.  No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 
2.  New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or flood-proofed to elevations established in accordance with article 4, subsection 2005 B. 
E.  Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH Zones). Areas of special flood hazard established in subsection 2003 A. may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
1.  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and non-residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 2005 A.4., "Elevated buildings". The zoning administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.

Any changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted to FEMA for review as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. Upon completion of the project, the developer is responsible for submitting the "as-built" data to FEMA in order to obtain the final LOMR. 
G.  Standards for critical facilities. 
1.  Critical facilities shall not be located in the 100-year floodplain or the 500-year floodplain. 
2.  All ingress and egress from any critical facility must be protected to the 500-year flood elevation. 
(Res. No. A-10-06, § 3, 9-20-10) 
Sec. 2006. - Variance and appeal procedures. 
A.  The Spalding County board of appeals shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variances from the requirements of this ordinance in accordance with section 411.

C.  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Spalding County board of appeals may petition the Superior Court of Spalding County for a writ of certiorari. 
D.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
E.  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this ordinance are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
F.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
G.  In reviewing such requests, the Spalding County board of appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this ordinance. 
H.  Conditions for variances. 
1.  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
2.  The provisions of this ordinance are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a Historic Structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
3.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
4.  The zoning administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
5.  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this ordinance, the Spalding County board of appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance.

ARTICLE 21. - S-2 SENSITIVE LAND-WATERSHED PROTECTION DISTRICT[8] 

Footnotes: 
--- (8) --- 
Editor's note— Res. No. A-01-11A, § 1, adopted Aug. 6, 2001, repealed art. 21, §§ 2101—2105, in its entirety and enacted new provisions to read as herein set out. Prior to amendment, art. 21 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from the 1995 Code. 

Sec. 2101. - Purpose. 
In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within Spalding County and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted development. Land-disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs, in addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxins, nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering wasters resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies. 
The purpose of this article is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of Spalding County; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This article shall apply to all existing and proposed water supply watersheds within Spalding County. 
Additionally, the S-2 Watershed Protection District is intended to maintain a high water quality of the surface water (rivers, creeks, streams and springs) and underground water to assure that a high quality of drinking water is maintained in the future. The district is intended to provide for certain development uses, while maintaining and protecting area water sources from polluting effects of more intense development and from encroachments of those uses that are not compatible with a protected watershed area. 
(Res. No. A-01-11A, § 2, 8-6-01) 
Sec. 2102. - Relationship to other zoning districts. 
S-2 is an overlay district which applies additional definitions and standards for development to specific areas which lie within any of the zoning districts identified in Articles 5—19 of this ordinance. To the extent the boundaries of the S-2 district overlay property located within other districts, the regulations of both districts shall apply. However if required development standards are specified in both districts, the more stringent provision shall control. 
(Res. No. A-01-11A, § 2, 8-6-01) 
Sec. 2103. - Definitions.

B.  Corridor: All land located within the buffer areas established adjacent to reservoirs or perennial streams within a water supply watershed and within other setback areas specified in section 2104 of this article. 
C.  Impervious surface: A manmade structure or surface which prevents the infiltration of storm water into the ground below the structure or surface, including (for purposes of example only), but not limited to, buildings, roads, driveways, parking lots, swimming pools and patios. 
D.  Large water supply watershed: A watershed containing one hundred (100) square miles or more of land within the drainage basin upstream of a governmentally owned public drinking water supply intake. 
E.  Perennial stream: A stream which flows throughout the whole year as indicated on a USGS quadrant map. 
F.  Reservoir boundary: The edge of a water supply reservoir defined by its normal pool level. 
G.  Small water supply watershed: A watershed that contains less than one hundred (100) square miles of land within the drainage basin upstream of a governmentally owned public drinking water supply intake. 
H.  Utility: Public or private water or sewer piping systems, water or sewer pumping stations, electric power lines, fuel pipelines, telephone lines, roads, driveways, bridges, river/lake access facilities, storm water system and railroads or other utilities identified by a local government. 
I.  Water supply reservoirs: A governmentally owned impoundment of water for the primary purpose of providing water to one (1) or more governmentally owned public drinking water systems. This excludes any multipurpose reservoirs owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
J.  Water supply watershed: The area of land upstream of a governmentally owned public drinking water intake. 
(Res. No. A-01-11A, § 2, 8-6-01) 
Sec. 2104. - Designation and classification of water supply watersheds. 
The following water supply watershed districts and reservoirs are hereby defined and designated by this article on the S-2 Watershed Protection District Map, as follows: 
1.  City of Griffin/Flint River Intake Water Supply Watershed: A large water supply watershed which provides an intake for the City of Griffin on the Flint River. This watershed does not contain a reservoir.

ARTICLE 21A. - S-3 SENSITIVE LAND-GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREA PROTECTION DISTRICT 

Sec. 2101A. - Purpose. 
The purpose of the S-3 district is to protect those lands identified as recharge areas for underground reservoirs known as aquifers. In order to promote the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within Spalding County and surrounding communities, its is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources on which Spalding County and surrounding communities rely as sources of public water. 
Groundwater resources are contained within underground reservoirs known as aquifers. These aquifers are zones of rock beneath the earth's surface capable of containing or producing water from a well. They occupy vast regions of the subsurface and are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized.

ARTICLE 21B. - S-4 SENSITIVE LAND-WETLANDS PROTECTION DISTRICT 

Sec. 2101B. - Purpose. 
The purpose of the S-4 district is to protect those lands identified as wetlands. Wetland areas are those areas that are flooded or saturated by surface or groundwater often and long enough to grow vegetation adapted for life in water saturated soil. The wetlands in Spalding County are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well being of many communities within the State of Georgia. A considerable number of important wetland natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piece meal or cumulative losses of wetlands will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
The purpose of the S-4 district is to promote wetlands protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. 
(Res. No. A-01-04, § 1, 8-6-01) 
Sec. 2102B. - Relationship to other zoning districts.

This map shall be referred to as the wetlands map and it is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto. The S-4 wetlands protection district applies additional definitions and standards for development to specific areas which lie within any of the zoning districts identified in this ordinance and which are additionally mapped as wetland areas, as shown on the wetlands map. 
(Res. No. A-01-04, § 1, 8-6-01). 
Sec. 2103B. - Definitions. 
The following definitions (in addition to those definitions contained within Article 2 of this Ordinance) apply to S-4 districts: 
A.  Corps of Engineers: The United States Army Corps of Engineers, which is given authority pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1344, for the regulation of wetlands and the permitting of fill material therein. 
B.  Wetlands: Any areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas.

ARTICLE 22. - AKB ARTHUR K. BOLTON PARKWAY OVERLAY ZONE 

Sec. 2201. - Purpose. 
AKB is an overlay zone which governs the development of property located along the Arthur K. Bolton Parkway (Georgia Highway 16 East) from approximately the eastern boundary of the city limits of the City of Griffin, Georgia, to the Spalding County line with Butts County. This overlay zone applies additional development standards to the area contained within the overlay zone. The purpose of this overlay zone is to develop standards and criteria for development of property within the zone in a comprehensive, planned manner creating a residential, business and manufacturing corporate campus development environment and to prevent piece-meal development along the Arthur K. Bolton Parkway in a manner which would deter the ease of flow of traffic from the City of Griffin to Interstate 75. Additionally, the overlay zone is designed to create an attractive and functional entryway from Interstate 75 through eastern Spalding County to the City of Griffin. To establish this environment, entry and exit points along the Arthur K. Bolton Parkway shall be limited, and strict adherence to aesthetic development criteria including buffers, greenbelts, landscaping and signage restrictions shall be required. 
It is the express legislative intent of this overlay district that strip or single lot commercial development will undermine the objective sought through the adoption and implementation of this ordinance. While this ordinance seeks to confer additional rights without depriving any property of its existing rights, the passage of this ordinance should not be interpreted as an endorsement of the traditional commercial zoning which it seeks to avoid. 
(Res. of 6-5-98, § 1) 
Sec. 2202. - Identification of property located within the AKB zone. 
A.  AKB shall include and apply to all real property in Spalding County located and lying within the following boundaries: On the west by the city limits of the City of Griffin, Georgia; on the east by the Spalding County boundary with Butts County; on the north by a line extending eastward from the city limits of the City of Griffin, Georgia, to the Spalding County boundary with Butts County, running parallel to the northern right-of-way of Arthur K. Bolton Parkway at a distance of seven hundred fifty (750) feet from such northern right-of-way; and on the south by a line extending eastward from the city limits of the City of Griffin, Georgia, to the Spalding County boundary with Butts County, running parallel to the southern right-of-way of Arthur K. Bolton Parkway at a distance of seven hundred fifty (750) feet from such southern right-of-way. 
B.  No tract shall be divided between AKB and another zoning district. If any portion of any lot lies within AKB, the entire lot shall be governed by the overlay restrictions in AKB.

Sec. 2204A. - Surfaces and zones as applied to the Griffin-Spalding County Airport Overlay Zoning District. 
To carry out the provisions of this ordinance, certain zones are established which include all of the land lying beneath the approach surface, transitional surfaces, horizontal surface and conical surface as they apply to the Griffin-Spalding County Airport. Such zones are shown on the map established pursuant to Section 2211A. An area located in more than one (1) of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. 
The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows: 
A.  Approach surface: A surface longitudinally centered on an extended runway centerline and extending outward and upward from each end of the primary surface. An approach surface is applied to each end of a runway based upon the type of approach available or planned for that runway end. 
1.  The inner edge of the approach surface is the same width as the primary surface—one thousand (1,000) feet—and expands uniformly to a width of: 
a.  Fifteen hundred (1,500) feet for a runway with only visual approaches; and 
b.  Sixteen hundred (1,600) feet for a precision instrument runway. 
2.  The approach surface extends for a horizontal distance of: 
a.  Five thousand (5,000) feet at a slope of twenty (20) to one (1) for visual runways; and 
b.  Ten thousand (10,000) feet at a slope of fifty (50) to one (1) with an additional forty thousand (40,000) feet at a slope of forty (40) to one (1) for all precision instrument runways.

A.  Future uses: Except as specifically provided in subsections 1., 2., and 3., hereunder, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefore shall have been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this ordinance shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with subsection D. below. 
1.  In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones. 
2.  In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a horizontal distance of not less than four thousand two hundred (4,200) feet from each end of the runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach zones. 
3.  In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition zones.

2.  Any construction of or alteration to a structure that exceeds an imaginary surface extending outward and upward at any of the following slopes: 
a.  One hundred (100) to one (1) for a horizontal distance of twenty thousand (20,000) feet from the nearest point of the nearest runway. 
b.  Fifty (50) to one (1) for a horizontal distance of ten thousand (10,000) feet from the nearest point of the nearest runway. 
Additional information, applicable forms and instructions can be found on the internet at https://oeaa.faa.gov/oeaa/external/portal.jsp. The FAA response will be one of the following: 
Determination of no hazard to air navigation; or 
Notice of presumed hazard. 
In such a case, the proponent will have the option of modifying their request, moving forward with their request, or withdrawing their request. 
The FAA response and any additional information the airport authority, the City of Griffin, or Spalding County, Georgia may require must then be reported to the airport authority at its next regularly scheduled meeting. Thereafter, the airport authority may act to recommend approval, disapproval, or to table the item until the next regularly scheduled meeting in order to facilitate further study of the proposed structure. In furtherance of the airport authority's recommendation, Spalding County will then act on the permit application. 
C.  Existing uses: No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of this ordinance or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted. 
D.  Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed: Whenever the administrative officer determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than eighty (80) percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. 
E.  Variances: Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property, not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this ordinance, may apply to the board of appeals for a variance from such regulations. The application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief granted, will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this ordinance. Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this ordinance may be considered by the board of appeals unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the airport authority for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the airport authority does not respond to the application within fifteen (15) days after receipt, the board of appeals may act on its own to grant or deny said application. 
F.  Obstruction marking and lighting: Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this ordinance and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate, and maintain, at the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper by the board of appeals, this condition may be modified to require the owner to permit the airport authority at its own expense, to install, operate, and maintain the necessary markings and lights.

Editor's note— The figures referenced in this article are not set out at length herein, but are on file in the offices of the county. 

Sec. 2201B. - Purpose. 
The Tri County Crossing area of Spalding County, consisting of property located near the intersection of U.S. Highway 19/41 and Zebulon Road, is an important crossroad and emerging commercial center in Spalding County. Through the Atlanta Regional Commission's Livable Centers Initiative, Spalding County developed the Tri County Crossing LCI Plan, adopted in March 2009, which articulated a future vision for the development of this area. The plan seeks to create a focused and walkable mixed-use center integrating commercial, employment and residential uses. The Tri County Crossing Overlay District (TCC) implements the vision for this area set forth in the Tri-County Crossing LCI Plan by guiding development to: create a vibrant pedestrian-oriented area, establish better connectivity to surrounding neighborhoods, protect and enhance public open spaces, encourage mixed-use development and a range of housing options, and maximize connectivity and mobility of all types. 
The TCC District identifies important and required new street connections which will be built as development occurs. It will create a connected system of streets and blocks that manage and distribute vehicular traffic and ensure a pattern of walkable pedestrian-oriented streets. Street design standards ensure that future streets will encourage walking and cycling and provide valuable public spaces. 
The TCC District includes development standards that ensure pedestrian-oriented design. Buildings are sited close to streets with active ground floor use and pedestrian amenities. A range of housing options is permitted and encouraged in order to create a mixed-use center where housing and services are located within walking distance of each other. The resulting development pattern will better utilize land, protect open space, manage traffic congestion, and create lasting community value.

Sec. 2305. - Zoning district boundaries. 
Where uncertainty exists with respect to the exact location of the boundary of a zoning district shown on the official map, the following guidelines will be used in establishing the exact location of the boundary: 
A.  Where a zoning district boundary line as appearing on the official map divides a single lot that was a single lot at the time of the enactment of this ordinance, the requirements for the zoning district shall extend only as far as the zoning district boundary line. 
B.  Where a zoning district boundary is indicated as approximately following a municipal limits or county line, the municipal limits or county line is the boundary. 
C.  Where a zoning district boundary is indicated as approximately following a property line or such line extended, the line or lines extended is the boundary. 
D.  Where a zoning district boundary is indicated as approximately following the center line of a stream bed, such a center line is the boundary. 
E.  Where a zoning district boundary is indicated as approximately parallel to the center line of a street, road, railroad, or the right-of-way of such a facility, the zoning district boundary is parallel to the line and at a distance from it as indicated by scale on the official map. 
Sec. 2306. - Relationship between official map and Spalding County Comprehensive Plan. 
A.  The Spalding County Comprehensive Plan was prepared by the planning commission and adopted by the Board of Commissioners of Spalding County. It should provide the best possible indication of desirable land use patterns that will meet projected future demand for land uses of various types. The Spalding County Comprehensive Plan supplies a body of information on which decisions on future development may be made that are guided by sound planning principles. The plan does not legally regulate land uses. It contains a future land use map, which shows suitable areas for various types of land uses. Actual land uses may not necessarily conform to the land use map. 
B.  The zoning districts contained on the official map set forth standards with which all new construction and development in Spalding County must comply. The application of zoning districts to property located within Spalding County is based on land use information contained and shown on the Spalding County Future Land Use Map which is a part of the Spalding County Comprehensive Plan. Amendment of zoning district boundaries must conform to the Spalding County Future Land Use Map.

1.  Minimum requirement: Each residential development shall set aside and develop ten (10) percent of the total acreage of the development for recreation, common areas, and green space. 
2.  Unsuitable reservations. Whenever the planning commission finds that a proposed reservation or dedication of land for public use is not suitable for such public use, it may require the rearrangement of lots to provide suitable land for public use. 
G.  Planned developments: Planned developments are allowed as per Article 17 of the Spalding County UDO. 
H.  Community assets: In all subdivisions, due regard must be shown for all natural features such as large trees, water courses, historical sites, and similar community assets which will add attractiveness and value to the property if preserved. 
I.  Architectural criteria for single-family dwellings located within a subdivision and/or minor subdivision: Single-family dwellings constructed within a subdivision located within AR-1 (Agricultural and Residential), AR-2 (Rural Reserve), R-1A, (Single-Family Residential), R-1 (Single-Family Residential Low Density), R-2 (Single-Family Residential), R-4 (Single-Family), and R-5 (Single-Family) zoning districts shall comply with the following architectural criteria: 
1.  The pitch of the roof of each residential dwelling shall have a minimum vertical rise of six (6) feet for each twelve (12) feet of horizontal run, provided this requirement shall not apply to roof structures covering porches, gables, bay windows, dormer windows, and garages;

3.  The facade of each residential dwelling shall include accents of brick, stone, cemplank shakes, or wood shakes which shall cover at least twenty-five (25) percent of the surface area thereof. 
4.  Alternatively, on houses with a crawlspace or built-up slab of at least eighteen (18) inches, the facade may be full faced stucco or cemplank siding; however, all other exterior walls shall be required to be faced with cemplank siding as well. 
5.  The provision of this ordinance shall apply to any subdivision platted on or after March 17, 2003. 
J.  Lot and foundation survey: 
1.  Prior to the issuance of a building permit for the construction of a building pursuant to Section 408 of the Unified Development Ordinance, a survey of the lot and foundation shall be provided to the building official to verify that the building or structure will be located within the designated setbacks and within the buildable area of the lot. 
2.  The foundation surveys shall be submitted to and approved by the Spalding County Community Development Department and approval by the department shall be designated in writing on the survey. 
3.  It shall be unlawful to commence any construction work on any building or structure until the foundation survey has been approved by the building official and filed with the Spalding County Community Development Department. 
4.  Violations of this provision may be subject to a stop work order and/or citation for a violation of this regulation. 
(Res. No. A-00-21, § 2, 11-6-00; Res. No. A-03-02, § 1, 3-17-03; Res. No. A-06-06, § 1, 6-5-06; Res. No. A-06-10, § 1, 9-11-06; Res. No. A-13-06, § 1, 10-7-13) 
Sec. 502. - Development standards for streets. 
All streets established in the county after the effective date of this ordinance must comply with the following development standards: 
A.  Continuation of existing streets: Wherever slope will permit, the arrangement of streets in a subdivision must provide for the alignment and continuation or projection of existing streets into adjoining areas. Existing streets must be continued at the same or greater width, but in no case less than the required width. 
B.  Street names: Streets or roads that are extensions of or obviously in alignment with existing streets should have the same name as the existing street. The names of new streets and roads are subject to the approval of the planning commission and must not duplicate or be similar in sound to existing names—Even if the suffix, street, avenue, drive, etc. is different. 
C.  Development along arterial streets: Where a subdivision abuts or contains an arterial street (see Spalding County Comprehensive Plan for street classification plan), the planning commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on either side of the right-of-way of the arterial street to provide access to lots along the arterial street while avoiding direct driveway curb cuts on the arterial street. Such a street may either abut the arterial street or railroad right-of-way or be located a suitable distance away to allow an appropriate use of the intervening land with a non-access reservation along the arterial street and a buffer. In such cases, lots must have access only from the access street. 
D.  Intersections: The centerlines of no more than two (2) streets may intersect at any one point. Streets must be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. No street may intersect at any other street at an angle of less than eighty (80) degrees. The angle of intersection is to be measured at the intersection of the street centerlines. 
E.  Offset intersections (street jogs): Offset intersections with centerline offsets of less than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet are not permitted. 
E'.  Acceleration/deceleration lane requirements: Where any new, proposed street(s) will intersect an existing street or road, acceleration and deceleration lanes will be required where new construction will intersect an existing street or road with the criteria of the following safety issues being reviewed by the zoning administrator or his designee: speed, sight distance or traffic volume. If the new street will interest a road in the state highway system, a permit or letter of approval from DOT will be required before the approval of the preliminary plat. Examples are shown in attachment A. Paving standards for acceleration and deceleration lanes are set in section 503 Q.1. of this ordinance. 

F.  Dead-end streets (culs-de-sac): Local streets designed to have one end permanently closed must be provided with a turnaround at the closed end having a right-of-way of at least one hundred twenty (120) feet in diameter. The paved area of the turnaround shall be an uninterrupted area of pavement at least eighty (80) feet in diameter.

1.  Subbase: The subbase course shall consist of placing subbase material in layers of maximum thickness of eight (8) inches of compacted material over subgrade surface to support a pavement base course. Specific standards for the subbase are as follows: 
a.  Satisfactory soil materials shall be those complying with ASTM D2487 soil classification groups GW, GP, GM, SM, SW and SP. 
b.  All subbase materials shall be compacted to a minimum ninety-eight (98) percent maximum density standard proctor (ASTM D698). 
c.  Where subbase material must be moisture conditioned before compaction, uniformly apply water to surface of subbase layer. Apply water in minimum quantity as necessary to prevent free water from appearing on surface. Remove and replace or scarify and air dry soil material that is too wet to permit compaction to specified density. 
d.  Provide quality control testing in accordance with ASTM D1556 (soil care method) or ASTM D2167 (rubber balloon method). Field density tests shall be performed at a rate of one test per two thousand (2000) square feet of paved area at varying depths as directed by the county engineer. If, in the opinion of the county engineer, based on testing service reports and inspection, subgrade or fills that have been placed are below specified density, contractor shall perform additional compaction and testing until specified density is achieved. 
2.  Base: The base must consist of graded aggregate base having a minimum thickness after being thoroughly compacted as stipulated in the roadway classification standards identified as subsection P of this section. The base must be constructed on a prepared subbase in accordance with these specifications and in conformity with the lines, grades, and typical cross section as shown in the approved construction plans. Specific standards for the base are as follows: 
a.  All materials must be of an approved type. 
b.  As soon as the base material has been spread and mixed, the base must be brought to the approximate line, grade, and cross section, and then rolled with a sheepsfoot roller until the roller walks out. Then the base material must be rolled with a pneumatic tire or general purpose roller until full thickness of the base course has been compacted thoroughly. Defects must be remedied as soon as they are discovered. A representative of Spalding County shall measure for proper thickness, line, grade and cross-section prior to placement of any prime coat application. 
c.  Base course shall be compacted to one hundred (100) percent maximum dry density. 
d.  The base course must be maintained under traffic and kept free from ruts, ridges, and dustings. It must be kept true to the approved cross section until it is primed. 
e.  Base material must not be deposited or shaped when subgrade conditions are freezing, thawing, or otherwise unfavorable for stability. 
3.  Pavement: Wearing surface must conform to mixes found suitable by the Georgia Department of Transportation. Wearing surface must be applied after a prime coat. Unless otherwise approved by the administrative officer, pavement must be constructed as follows: 
a.  The prime coat must be cut-back asphalt or cut-back asphalt emulsion applied on a clean, slightly damp surface in an amount of from 0.15 to 0.30 gallons per square yard, depending upon the nature and condition of the surface. 
b.  The tack coat must be cut-back asphalt or cut-back asphalt emulsion applied on a clean surface in an amount of from 0.15 to 0.30 gallons per square yard, depending upon the nature and condition of the surface.

V.  Tangents: All tangents between reverse curves must conform to the roadway classification standards identified in subsection P of this section. 
W.  Vertical alignment: Vertical curve lengths must be at least ten (10) times the algebraic difference in grades, with the grades expressed in feet per hundred. No vertical curve shall be less than fifty (50) feet. All roads shall have a crown of one-fourth (¼) inch per foot except where super-elevation prevails. 
1.  In approaches to intersections, there shall be a suitable leveling of the street at a grade not exceeding two (2) percent for a distance of not less than fifty (50) feet, exclusive of any portion of a vertical curve, for local and minor streets, and one hundred (100) feet, exclusive of any portion of a vertical curve, for collector streets, from the nearest line of the intersecting street and as directed for arterial streets by standards set forth by the Georgia Department of Transportation. 
X.  Curb-line radii: At street intersections, property lines must be rounded with a curb radius of twenty-five (25) feet. However, in situations where the angle of intersection of two streets is less than ninety (90) degrees, the planning commission may permit comparable cutoffs in chords in place of rounded corners. 
Y.  Right-of-way radius: The right-of-way radius at street intersections must parallel the curb line radius. 
Z.  Steep slope development: Street design and construction in areas of steep slopes are subject to variance from the development standards contained in this ordinance if deemed by the planning commission to be necessary to carry out the intent and purpose of this ordinance and if so ordered by the planning commission. If such a variance is ordered, the administrative officer will establish appropriate design and construction standards on an individual basis. 
AA.  Grading: All streets, roads, and alleys must be graded by the developer in such a manner that pavements and other improvements (sidewalks and curb and gutter, if provided or required) can be constructed to the required cross section. The minimum width of grading must be the pavement width as specified in this ordinance plus six (6) feet on each side measured from the back of curb or pavement edge. Deviation from the above will be allowed only when due to special topographical (slope) conditions. 
1.  Preparation: Before grading is started, the entire right-of-way area must be first cleared of all stumps, roots, brush, other objectionable materials, and trees not intended for preservation. 
2.  Cuts: All tree stumps, boulders, and other obstructions must be removed below the subgrade. Rock, when encountered, must be scarified (broken up and loosened) to a depth of twelve (12) inches below the subgrade. 
3.  Fill: All suitable material from roadway cuts may be used in the construction of fills, approaches, or at other places as needed. Excess materials, including organic materials, soft clay, etc., must be removed from the roadway. The fill must be spread in layers no more than eight (8) inches thick and compacted. The filling of utility trenches and other places not accessible to the roller must be mechanically tamped and compaction requirements met for subgrade materials. 
4.  Subgrade: The subgrade must be properly shaped, rolled, and uniformly compacted to conform with the lines, grades, and typical cross sections as shown on required drawings and approved by the administrative officer. Unsuitable material must be excavated and replaced with acceptable compacted material. 
BB.  Sidewalks: In residential developments in which the majority of lots do not exceed twenty thousand (20,000) square feet in size, sidewalks shall be required along both sides of all interior streets within the development. In residential developments in which the majority of lots are between twenty thousand (20,000) square feet and one (1) acre in size, sidewalks shall be required on at least one (1) side of all interior streets within the development. Sidewalks may be required by the board of commissioners where it is determined that safe and convenient pedestrian movement are essential. Common examples of such situations are school sites, commercial areas, places of public assembly, or across unusually long blocks. Required sidewalks or those installed at the option of the subdivider must meet the following development standards: 
1.  They must be at least three (3) feet wide. 
2.  They must not be placed immediately adjacent to street curbs. 
3.  They must otherwise be installed according to required construction plans as approved by the administrative officer. 
CC.  Street name signs: Street name signs must be installed at intersections within a subdivision. The location and design of such signs must be approved by the administrative officer. 
DD.  Street trees: The planting of street trees is not required. However, the subdivider is encouraged to plant trees along the street to enhance the appearance of the subdivision. Such trees, if planted on a street right-of-way, must be planted in a manner to insure that there will be no conflict with utility lines either above or below the ground surface. 
EE.  Sight distance: Within thirty (30) feet of the pavement edge, plants cannot be of a type which will exceed a height of thirty (30) inches at maturity and/or a trunk diameter of four (4) inches. There may be some flexibility in regard to the maximum trunk diameter when protected by a guardrail or some other suitable type barrier beyond thirty (30) feet from pavement edge. Almost any type of planted vegetation is permissible. 
FF.  Gated streets: Gated streets may be developed within a "planned residential development" and a "planned neighborhood development," as defined in the Zoning Ordinance of Spalding County, Article 17, Planned Development District (PDD). A gated street shall be developed in compliance with the standards set forth in this section. Gated streets may be developed only with the approval of the board of commissioners. 
(Res. No. A-00-08, § 1, 9-11-00; Res. No. A-00-15, §§ 1—3, 7-17-00; Res. No. A-00-21, § 2, 11-6-00; Res. No. A-04-09, §§ 1, 2, 6-7-04; Res. No. A-05-11(1), § 1, 8-15-05; Res. No. A-07-04, §§ 1—3, 6-4-07) 
Sec. 503. - Development standards for lots. 
All lots established in Spalding County after the effective date of this ordinance must comply with the development standards contained in this section. However, where provisions of the Spalding County Zoning Ordinance apply and are more restrictive, those provisions take precedence. Development standards for lots are as follows: 
A.  Lot lines: As far as practical, side lot lines must be perpendicular or radial to street lines. 
B.  Jurisdictional limits and lot lines: Lots must not be divided by city or county boundary lines. 
C.  Lot frontage arrangements: Lots must be subdivided in a manner that provides that each lot shall abut an existing public street or an approved street contained within the proposed subdivision with minimum frontage width as required by the development standards for the zoning district in which the subdivision is located. 
D.  Adequate building sites: Each lot must contain an adequate building site not subject to flooding and outside the limits of existing easements or building setback lines required by this ordinance or any existing ordinance as is appropriate. 
E.  Panhandle or flag lots: Any lot for which the frontage width is less than the minimum required in the applicable zoning district. Flag or panhandle lots are prohibited. 
F.  Double or reverse frontage lots: Double and reverse frontage, unless required by the planning commission, are prohibited except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of slope, orientation, or property size. A reserve strip planted with a vegetative screen across which there is no right of access may be required along the line of lots abutting such a traffic artery or other incompatible use. 
G.  Commercial and industrial lots: Size, shape, and arrangement of commercial and industrial lots, where platted and classified as a subdivision, are subject to the approval of the planning commission. Where public water and/or sewage are not available, minimum lot size and minimum coverage will be based on lot area needed for proper sewage disposal and/or water supply. However, the building setback must be at least fifteen (15) feet from the front property line of the lot, regardless of the classification of the street. Within this setback, no permanent surface structures or facilities are allowed to be constructed. 
H.  Lot remnants: Lot remnants are prohibited. Such remnant areas must be added to adjacent lots, rather than remain as unusable parcels. 
I.  Monuments: Solid steel rods at least one-half (½) inch in diameter or square and two (2) feet long, must be set at all street corners, at all points where street lines intersect the exterior boundaries of the subdivision, at angle points in streets, at points of curve in streets, and at points of change of direction in the exterior boundaries of the subdivision. The top of the monument must have an indented cross to identify the finished grade. All other lot corners must be marked with solid steel rods no less than one-half (½) inch in diameter, and at least two (2) feet long, driven so as to be flush with the finished grade. 
J.  Driveway requirements: Every lot shall be served by a driveway which meets the following criteria: (#A-00-14—07/17/00) 
For lots with structures located less than one hundred (100) feet from the right-of-way of the street from which lot access is obtained, the driveway shall be paved and shall include a paved turn around area. 
For lots with structures located more than one hundred (100) feet from the right-of-way of the street from which lot access is obtained, the driveway shall be improved and shall include a designated turn around area. 
K.  Screening. Single-family and two-family residential lots abutting in the rear, which do not have natural screening in place along the rear property line, shall plant trees/vegetation or install an opaque fence in order to provide an adequate visual screen. Should the layout of the terrain be such that enforcement of this requirement would not provide adequate screening, an administrative variance from this requirement may be granted by the administrative officer. Approval of the variance may be granted subject to a written request. 
L.  Sodded front yards. All development within a subdivision in which the front setback has been reduced to fifty (50) feet, will require sodded front yards. Side yards on double frontage lots must be sodded a minimum distance of ten (10) feet from the curb. When this option has been chosen, each lot within the subdivision, irrespective of the setback, must be sodded. 
M.  Driveways: No driveways shall be permitted along existing road frontage, unless the lot is otherwise cut-off from the rest of the development by way of topography or other geographic feature that makes internal access to the lot impractical as determined by the zoning administrator. Unless otherwise provided herein, all driveways must be paved.

A.  Utility easements: When it is found to be necessary and desirable to locate public utility lines in other than street rights-of-way, easements must be shown on the plat for such purposes. Such easements must not be less than twenty (20) feet wide and, where possible, must be centered on rear or side lot lines. All utility easements shall comply with the minimum standards as specified by the utility provider. 
B.  Installation of utilities: No overhead utilities shall be permitted, except on a temporary basis as may be required for construction. Any such line must be immediately removed upon completion of construction. After grading is completed and approved and before any base is applied, all of the underground work within the street right-of-way—Water mains, gas mains, etc.—Must be installed completely and approved throughout the length of the road and across the flat section. At the same time, all service connections must be stubbed out to each lot. 
C.  Street lighting: Street lighting will be installed and maintained as required in part IV, chapter 6, entitled "Street Light Districts" of the Code of Spalding County, Georgia. 
D.  Water supply systems:

Fire hydrant spacing shall meet minimum Life Safety Code requirements in effect at the time of platting. If no new streets are proposed within the subdivision, all hydrants must be installed at the developer's expense and functional prior to approval of the final plat by the county. 
2.  Community water supply system: If a public water supply is not available, the subdivider may install a community water system developed according to plans and specifications shown on the approved construction plans and approved by the Environmental Protection Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. 
3.  Individual water supply: When a public water supply is not available and a community water system is not proposed by the subdivider, the subdivider must carefully consider the capability and suitability of the general area of the subdivision to support individual water supplies. Such proposed water supplies must be approved by the Spalding County Health Department. The county must consider the recommendation of the Spalding County Health Department regarding any proposed private water supplies in considering approval of a plat. 
E.  Sanitary sewer disposal systems: 
1.  Public sewage system: If a public sewage system is available to a proposed subdivision and connection to it is permitted, sewage mains, and stub connections to each lot within the subdivision must be provided as shown on approved construction plans. 
2.  Individual sewage system: When a public sewage system is not available, the subdivider must carefully consider the capability and suitability of the general area of the subdivision to support individual sewage systems (septic tanks). Such proposed sewage system must be approved by the Spalding County Health Department. The county must consider the recommendation of the Spalding County Health Department regarding any proposed private sewage systems in considering approval of a plat.

ARTICLE 7. - CONSERVATION SUBDIVISIONS[12] 

Footnotes: 
--- (12) --- 
Editor's note— Res. No. A-04-12, adopted June 7, 2004, amended Art. 7 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. 7, §§ 701—715, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from a resolution of Oct. 25, 2001, § 1. 

Sec. 701. - Purposes. 
A.  The purpose of this article is to encourage development principles and strategies which conserve open land in Spalding County, including those areas with unique and sensitive natural features such as woodlands, steep slopes, streams, floodplains and wetlands by setting them aside from future development. To accomplish this purpose, this article encourages development and design standards separate and distinct from traditional subdivision development with the following additional goals: 
1.  To provide greater design flexibility and efficiency in siting services and infrastructure, including the opportunity to reduce the length of roads, utility easement runs and the amount of paving required for residential development; 
2.  To reduce soil erosion and sedimentation by retaining existing vegetation and minimizing development on steep slopes; 
3.  To provide for a diversity of lot sizes and residential density; 
4.  To protect areas of Spalding County with productive agricultural soil for continued or future agricultural use by conserving blocks of land large enough to allow for efficient farm operation; 
5.  To create neighborhoods with direct visual access to open land, with amenities of neighborhood open space and with a strong neighborhood identity; 
6.  To provide for the conservation and maintenance of open land within Spalding County for active or passive recreational use by residents; 
7.  To provide for multiple options for development to minimize impacts on environmental resources and sensitive lands such as wetlands, floodplains and steep slopes; 
8.  To prevent disturbance of natural or cultural features such as mature woodlands, hedgerows and tree lines, wildlife habitats and historic buildings or structures; and 
9.  To conserve scenic views and elements of Spalding County's natural character and to minimize perceived density by minimizing views of new development from existing streets and roads. 
B.  In order to achieve the purposes of this article, flexibility is allowed for the design of residential subdivisions by allowing a conservation form of subdivision, as follows: 
Neutral density and basic conservation: This form of subdivision development is allowed in the following zoning districts: AR-1, AR-2, R-1, R-2, R-4 and R-5. Residential uses are allowed at the following maximum densities for based on the result of the yield plan design: 

 
(Res. No. A-04-12, 6-7-04) 
Sec. 702. - General regulations. 
The design of all conservation subdivisions shall be governed by the following minimum standards: 
1.  Ownership: The tract of land may be held in single or multiple ownership. However, a tract held in multiple ownership shall be planned as a single development. 
2.  Site suitability: The tract shall be suitable for supporting development based on its size, configuration and environmental conditions. Tracts deemed unsuitable for promoting the purposes of this ordinance shall not be considered for development under the regulations of this article. Site unsuitable for conservation subdivision development shall include, but are not limited to: 
a.  Tracts where twenty (20) percent or more of the timber has been clear cut within five (5) years prior to development approval. 
b.  Tracts on which more than forty (40) percent of the soil has been disturbed by way of grading, root racking or surface mining within five (5) years prior to development approval. 
c.  Sites on which no natural or historic resources that further the intent of this ordinance can be identified. 
d.  Lots or tracts from which road frontage has been stripped to create road frontage lots. This requirement shall not be applicable to road frontage lots which are lots of record. 
The Spalding County Board of Commissioners shall make final determination as the whether or not a site is suitable for development of a conservation subdivision. 
3.  Intersections and access: Driveways serving residences located within a conservation subdivision must provide access by intersections with roads developed within the subdivision. With the exception of greenspace or conservation lots, no lots may be accessed directly from existing public roads. New intersections between existing roads and roads within the conservation subdivision shall be minimized. Additional intersections may be required based upon the location and condition of existing roads, the size of the proposed development, the size of the tract, traffic flow, and management and public safety. Interconnectivity of roads is desired. 
4.  Sensitive area disturbance: The subdivision design shall strictly minimize disturbance of environmentally and culturally sensitive areas, including but not limited to areas located within the 100-year floodplain, having a slope exceeding twenty-five (25) percent. Wetlands and/or historic areas. As a prerequisite of approval of any development, the applicant must first identify the location of these features and then demonstrate that these features will be protected. 
5.  Greenspace: That portion of a tract that is set aside for the protection of sensitive natural features, farmland, scenic views and other unique features. Greenspace may be accessible for the residents of the development and/or to Spalding County, or it may contain areas of conservancy lots that are not accessible to the public. 
6.  Conservancy lot: A large, privately owned lot constituting part of an area of greenspace. The purpose for the conservancy lot is to provide surrounding residents with visual access to greenspace land while keeping the land under private ownership and maintenance. Only a small portion of such lots may be developed; the remainder must be protected through conservation easements and used in conformance with standard for greenspace. Public access to public conservation lots is not required. For the purposes of this ordinance, the conservation lot shall be covered under the homeowner's association documents; however, given the nature of some of the allowed uses it may be exempt from the some of the subdivision covenants as long as harmonious coexistence of residential and agricultural can be maintained. 
(Res. No. A-04-12, 6-7-04; Res. No. A-06-09, § 1, 2-5-07) 
Sec. 703. - Dimensional standards and density determinations. 
A.  Dimensional standards for neutral density and basic conservation: 
1.  Density factor: Maximum density as allowed under the particular zoning district in which the conservation subdivision is located. Density shall be calculated on the basis of yield plan. 
2.  Minimum required lot area: 
a.  For areas served by public sewer: Fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet on average. Up to twenty (20) percent of the lots within the subdivision may be reduced to a minimum of twelve thousand (12,000) square feet. 
b.  For areas not served by public sewer: Minimum lot size as may be established by the Spalding County Health Department. 
3.  Minimum lot width at building line: Eighty (80) feet. 
4.  Minimum street frontage: Thirty (30) feet. 
5.  Yard regulations: Variations in principal building positions and orientation are encouraged, but shall meet the following minimum standards:

b.  Have a minimum width of twenty (20) feet if more than one (1) lot is accessed. 
c.  Maintain a clear area of at least twelve (12) feet in width and twelve and one-half (12½) feet in height. 
d.  May not exceed seven hundred fifty (750) feet in length. 
8.  Minimum tract size required for development of conservation subdivisions: Twenty-five (25) acres. For conservation subdivisions with an equestrian component, the minimum required tract size is fifty (50) acres. 
9.  Minimum aggregate green space total: Forty (40) percent of the total acreage of the tract provided the following additional criteria is met: 
a.  Designated wetlands may be included in the green space in the amount not more than ten (10) percent of the total acreage of the tract. 
b.  Detention facilities may be included in the green space. 
c.  Retention ponds lakes and watercourses may be included within the green space to the extent of not more than ten (10) percent of the total acreage of the tract. 
d.  Floodplain may be included in the green space in the amount not more than ten (10) percent of the total acreage of the tract. 
B.  Lot yield determination for conservation subdivisions: The method for determining the maximum permitted number of lots for conservation subdivisions. 
Yield plan: Determination of the maximum number of permitted residential dwelling units shall be obtained by a yield plan, which meets the following requirements: 
a.  A yield plan will be prepared as a conceptual layout plan showing proposed lots, streets, rights-of-way and other pertinent development features based upon the standard lot size and dimension requirements for the applicable zoning district. Though a scale drawing is not required, the conceptual layout plan must be a realistic layout reflecting a development pattern that could reasonably be expected to be implemented, taking into account the presence of wetlands, floodplains, steep slopes, existing easements or encumbrances and, if unsewered, the suitability of soils for septic tanks. 
b.  A yield plan must also incorporate the site's naturally occurring resources and characteristics, and the plan must demonstrate that the site's naturally occurring resources and characteristics may be successfully absorbed in the development process without disturbance by allocating a particular area of the tract to proposed single-family dwelling lots that conform to the density factor. For the purpose of calculation the yield, no more than of residential lot shown on the proposed yield plan shall include floodplain, steep slopes or wetlands. Water courses and lakes shall be not be included on any proposed residential lot. 
c.  On unsewered tracts, density shall be further determined by evaluating the number of residential dwellings that could be supported by individual septic systems on conventional lots. Based thereon, the zoning administrator shall select a ten (10) percent sample of the lots considered to be marginal for on-lot sewage disposal. The applicant is required to provide evidence that these lots meet the standards for individual septic systems, at which time the applicant shall be granted the full density determined by the yield plan. Should any of the sample lots fail to meet the standard for individual septic systems, those lots shall be deducted from the yield plan and a second ten (10) percent sample shall be selected and tested for compliance. This process shall be repeated until all lots in a given sample meet the standard for an individual septic system. 
(Res. No. A-04-12, 6-7-04; Res. No. A-06-09, § 2, 2-5-07)

To encourage the dedication of conservation land for public use (including active or passive recreation areas, spray irrigation areas and other public facilities), a density bonus shall be computed on the basis of a maximum of one dwelling unit per five acres of greenspace or per two thousand five hundred (2,500) feet of trail that becomes publicly accessible. The decision to accept the dedication of greenspace to public usage within a conservation subdivision shall be at the discretion of the board of commissioners. 
B.  Endowment for greenspace maintenance. If the greenspace is to be donated to a land trust or to Spalding County, a ten (10) percent density bonus may be allowed to generate additional income for the purpose of endowing a permanent fund to offset continuing costs of maintaining the greenspace (including such activities as mowing meadows, removing invasive vines, paying insurance premiums and local taxes, including costs associated with active or passive recreation facilities). Spending from this fund should be restricted to expenditure of interest so that the principal may be preserved. The amount required for contribution to the endowment shall be at least twenty (20) times the annual estimated maintenance costs. The applicant shall present an estimate prepared by an agency, firm or organization acceptable to Spalding County and with experience in managing conservation land and recreational facilities. 
C.  Increasing the minimum heated floor area. A ten (10) percent density bonus may be allowed if the minimum heated floor area for each home is raised a minimum of two hundred fifty (250) square feet above the minimum heated floor area required by the zoning of that tract. For tracts that contain multiple zoning districts minimum floor area is determined by largest district on that tract. 
D.  Implementation. The density bonus that may be allowed pursuant to this section shall reduce the amount of required greenspace by up to ten (10) percent, reducing the minimum lot area requirements by up to ten (10) percent or by a combination thereof (at the discretion of Spalding County). The reductions may be cumulative, if Spalding County is satisfied that the public purpose of preserving greenspace and conservation lands within Spalding County is best being served.

(Res. No. A-04-12, 6-7-04) 
Sec. 709. - Plan design and approval process. 
Conservation subdivision design is a preliminary process leading up to the submittal of a preliminary plat for review and approval by the Spalding County Planning Commission. The subdivision approval process as required elsewhere in this ordinance shall govern the approval of the preliminary and ultimately final plat for conservation subdivisions. 
A.  Submittal of the resource and site analysis plan and yield plan. A resource and site analysis and yield plan as described in section 708.A. shall be submitted at least fourteen (14) days prior to the begin of the design process. Staff shall review the plan and schedule a mandatory on-site meeting with the developer for the purpose of identifying conservation features on the ground and gain an understanding of the basic design parameters of the site. 
B.  Four-step design process for subdivisions in the conservation design overlay district. All conceptual preliminary plans in the Conservation Design Overlay District shall include documentation of a four-step design process in determining the layout of proposed greenway lands, house sites, streets and lot lines, as described below. 
1.  Step 1: Delineation of greenway lands. 
a.  The minimum percentage and acreage of required greenway lands shall be calculated by the applicant and submitted as part of the sketch plan or conceptual preliminary plan in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance and of the zoning ordinance. Greenway lands shall include all primary conservation areas and those parts of the remaining buildable lands with the highest resource significance, as described below and in section 708. 
b.  Proposed greenway lands shall be designated using the existing resources and site analysis plan as a base map and complying with section 708.A. herein, dealing with Resource Conservation and Greenway Delineation Standards. The county's map of potential conservation lands in the comprehensive plan shall also be referenced and considered. Primary conservation areas shall be delineated comprising floodplains, wetlands and slopes over twenty-five (25) percent. (The definition of primary conservation areas is independent of the "density factors" applied to various categories of constrained lands to calculate density) 
c.  In delineating secondary conservation areas, the applicant shall prioritize natural and cultural resources on the tract in terms of their highest to least suitability for inclusion in the proposed greenway, in consultation with the planning staff and in accordance with Section 709.A. herein. 
d.  On the basis of those priorities and practical considerations given to the tract's configuration, its context in relation to resources areas on adjoining and neighboring properties, and the applicant's subdivision objectives, secondary conservation areas shall be delineated to meet at least the minimum area percentage requirements for greenway lands and in a manner clearly indicating their boundaries as well as the types of resources included within them. 
2.  Step 2: Location of house sites. Potential house sites shall be tentatively located, using the proposed greenway lands as a base map as well as other relevant data on the existing resources and site analysis plan such as topography and soils. House sites should generally be located not closer than one hundred (100) feet from primary conservation areas and fifty (50) feet from secondary conservation areas, taking into consideration the potential negative impacts of residential development on such areas as well as the potential positive benefits of such locations to provide attractive views and visual settings for residences. 
3.  Step 3: Alignment of streets and trails. Upon designating the house sites, a street plan shall be designed to provide vehicular access to each house, complying with the standards in Article 7 herein and bearing a logical relationship to topographic conditions. Impacts of the street plan on proposed greenway lands shall be minimized, particularly with respect to crossing environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands and traversing slopes exceeding fifteen (15) percent. Street connections shall generally be encouraged to minimize the number of new culs-de-sac to be maintained by the municipality and to facilitate access to and from homes in different parts of the tract (and adjoining parcels). 
4.  Step 4: Drawing in the lot lines. Applicants shall be prepared to submit four (4) separate sketch maps indicating the findings of each step of the design process. 
County staff shall review the sketch plan in accordance with the criteria contained in this ordinance and with other application ordinances of Spalding County. The staff shall advise the applicant of the extent to which the proposed conservation subdivision conforms to the relevant standards of this ordinance. The staff may require plan modifications that would increase the degree of conformance of the conservation subdivision. 
After review by the planning commission, the sketch plan shall be placed on the next available board of commissioners' agenda for review and approval. 
C.  Preliminary plat submittal. Upon approval of the sketch plan by the board of commissioners, the preliminary plat for the subdivision may be submitted for review and approval by the Spalding County Planning Commission as required in Appendix A, Section 404 of this ordinance. All requirements for preliminary plat information and approval process shall be met. 
D.  Construction plan. A construction plan meeting the requirements of Appendix A, section 406 of this ordinance shall be submitted and approved by the county prior to permitting for land disturbance activity. A detailed plan for the development of any improvements to the green spaces shall be submitted with the construction plan. Such detailed plan shall include, but is not limited to the following items: 
1.  Design of playground facilities, clubhouses, pools and other amenities to be located in the greenspace areas. 
2.  Proposed landscape planting within greenspace areas. 
3.  Location of fences, walls and other barriers within the greenspace areas. 
E.  Final plat. A final plat meeting the requirements of Appendix A, sections 408 and 410 of this ordinance shall be submitted prior to the dedication of streets and sale of lots within the subdivision. With the submittal of the final plat, the applicant shall also submit the homeowners association documentation required herein. 
(Res. No. A-04-12, 6-7-04) 
Sec. 710. - Design guidelines for streets in conservation subdivisions. 
A.  Minimum pavement width: Twenty (20) feet, subject to approval by the county engineer. 
B.  Location and alignment: Streets should not cross wetlands. Existing farm roads, if any, should be incorporated into conservation subdivision designs. Roads should follow existing contours with a minimum of cut and fills for construction, minimizing land disturbance. In conservation subdivisions where agricultural protection or meadow preservation is a primary objective, roads should be placed along the edge of a field, rather than through the middle, so as to be less intrusive on the open space character of the tract. 
C.  Lengths and curves: The length of roads should be minimized to reduce costs and aesthetic impacts. Long, straight road segments should be avoided. Curvilinear designs are preferred for rural conservation subdivisions. Streets should be curved and aligned to produce vistas of open space elements, where possible. 
D.  Separate travel lanes: Where necessary, the directional travel lanes should split or curve apart to protect natural features. In cases where travel lanes are split or curve apart, the minimum width of each travel lane shall be fourteen (14) feet in paved width and shall require roll-type curbing. 
E.  Right-of-way and clearance: Rights-of-way shall be a minimum of fifty (50) feet and wide enough to accommodate the required street width improvement, adequate shoulder bases for utilities, bikeways and/or walkways, and open storm drainage ditches at appropriate bank slope. Drainage easements may be provided in lieu of expanding the right-of-way for drainage ditches if approved by the county engineer. The entire right-of-way may not necessarily have to be cleared if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the county engineer that remaining trees or other features do not pose a traffic safety hazard or impede access by emergency vehicles. 
F.  Connections: Streets should be connected with one another where possible, preferably in three-way intersections, so that the numbers of dead ends are minimized. Wherever possible, streets should be designed to connect with adjoining properties. 
G.  Culs-de-sac: Culs-de-sac are discouraged. Where culs-de-sac are unavoidable, such as for topographic reasons, they should be accompanied with pedestrian and/or bike linkages to other nearby streets and/or trail systems. Cul-de-sac streets should serve no more than twenty (20) dwellings, with a length not exceeding one thousand (1,000) feet. Cul-de-sac radii should not exceed forty (40) feet. 
H.  Reverse curves: Reverse curves (consecutive left and right curves without a straight segment separating them) are considered appropriate and may be encouraged, subject to the approval of the county engineer. 
I.  Single-loading streets: Single-loading streets (i.e., having only on one (1) side) are considered appropriate and encouraged, particularly around village greens, neighborhood commons, or open areas. 
J.  Curbs and drainage: For development of streets within conservation subdivisions curb and gutter shall be required. 
K.  Street trees: Street tree plantings are encouraged, provided that they are located so as not to present a traffic safety hazard, as determined by the county engineer and as shown on the standard street cross-sections adopted by the county. 
L.  Signs: For signs identifying street entrances to conservation subdivisions, signage shall be limited to one (1) monument sign per entrance to the off-site road. 
M.  Private driveways: Private driveways may be used to access up to five (5) lots, provided the requirements for maintenance thereof are set forth in the preliminary plat, the detailed final plan and any homeowner association documents or restrictive covenants and provided the same are approved by the county engineer. Private driveways must meet the following minimum standards: 
a.  All weather access that must be paved if they access more than one (1) lot. 
b.  Have a minimum width of twenty (20) feet if more than one (1) lot is served. 
c.  Maintain a clear area of at least twelve (12) feet in width and twelve and one-half (12½) feet in height. 
d.  May not exceed seven hundred fifty (750) feet in length. 
(Res. No. A-04-12, 6-7-04; Res. No. A-06-09, § 5, 2-5-07) 
Sec. 711. - Homeowner association documents. 
A homeowners' association document shall be required for all conservation subdivisions that propose lands and/or facilities to be used or owned in common by all the residents of the subdivision and which are not deeded to Spalding County or an approved land conservation trust. The required homeowners' association document shall include, but shall not necessarily be limited to the following: 
A.  A description of all lands and facilities to be commonly owned, including a plat showing the precise location of such common land and/or facilities; 
B.  A statement of the powers, duties and responsibilities of the homeowners association, and the services to be provided thereby; 
C.  A declaration of restrictive covenants, giving perpetual easement of the lands and facilities owned by the homeowners association, which shall provide automatic membership for all owners of real property within the conservation subdivision and which shall describe the mechanism and means by which such owners shall participate in the association, including voting, elections and meetings. The declaration shall give power to the association to own and maintain the common property and to make and enforce rules; 
D.  Statements prescribing the method and process by which the decisions of the homeowners' association shall be reached, setting forth the requirement for the legal authority of the homeowners' association to act; 
E.  Statements requiring each owner of real property within the conservation subdivision to become a member of the homeowners' association; 
F.  Statements creating cross-covenants between each owner to all other owners for the mutual benefit and enforcement of the homeowners' association; 
G.  Requirements that each owner of real property within the conservation subdivision provide and pay a pro rata share of the costs of the operation of the homeowners' association; 
H.  A process of collection and enforcement to obtain funds from owners who fail to comply; 
I.  A process for transition and control of the homeowners' association from the developer or applicant to the owners of real property within the conservation subdivision; 
J.  Statement describing how the lands and/or facilities of the homeowners' association shall be insured, both as to liability and property damage; 
K.  Provisions for the dissolution of the homeowners' association in the event it should become unviable. 
(Res. No. A-04-12, 6-7-04) 
Sec. 712. - Variances. 
Any person seeking a variance of any provision of this article shall file an application for a variance pursuant to the procedures set forth in section 411 of the zoning ordinance. 
(Res. No. A-04-12, 6-7-04) 
Sec. 713. - Greenspace layout and design. 
The following are examples of acceptable layout and design for conservation subdivisions within Spalding County. The examples shown within this section are not exhaustive. However, the design and layout of conservation subdivisions following these examples are deemed by Spalding County to be consistent with the design goals and objectives for conservation subdivisions.

Sec. 104. - Minimum requirements for erosion and sedimentation control using best management practices. 
A.  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this ordinance shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections 104.B. and C. of this ordinance. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this ordinance and the NPDES general permit. 
B.  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
1.  Best management practices as set forth in subsections 104.B. and 104.C. of this ordinance shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
2.  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than twenty-five (25) nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten (10) nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes, which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five (5) acres. 
3.  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
4.  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
5.  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in [subsections] C.15. and 16. in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
C.  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this chapter for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservative and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
1.  Stripping of vegetation, regarding and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
2.  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
3.  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
4.  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
5.  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
6.  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
7.  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
8.  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
9.  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1, et seq.; 
10.  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
11.  Cuts and fill may not endanger adjoining property; 
12.  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
13.  Grading equipment must cross-flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
14.  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 104.B.2. of this ordinance; 
15.  Except as provided in subsection 16. of this subsection, there is established a twenty-five-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; provided, however, the buffers of at least twenty-five (25) feet established pursuant to Part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
16.  There is established a fifty-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of twenty-five (25) gallons per minute or less shall have a twenty-five-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
17.  Building and waste materials and non-storm water discharges such as concrete, paint wash water, or machinery leakage or spillage must be managed to prevent them from entering the storm water system, ground water or nearby water body. 
D.  Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions, which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections 104.B. and 104.C. of this ordinance. 
E.  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this ordinance or the terms of the permit. 
(Res. No. A-10-05, § 2, 9-20-10) 
Sec. 105. - Application/permit process. 
A.  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall review the general development plans and detailed plans of the local issuing authority that affect the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall review the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this ordinance, and other ordinances which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the operator is the only party who may obtain a permit. 
B.  Application requirements. 
1.  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of Spalding County without first obtaining a permit from the community development office, its successor or designee to perform such activity. 
2.  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the community development office, its successor or designee and must include the applicant's erosion and sedimentation control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection 105.C. of this ordinance. Soil erosion and sedimentation control plans shall conform to the provisions of subsections 104.B. and C. of this ordinance. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three (3) copies of the applicant's soil erosion and sedimentation control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan or that such a visit was not required in accordance with rules and regulations established by the board. 
3.  For land-disturbing projects, in addition to the required state fee, a fee according to the following chart shall be charged: 
1-5 acres: $450.00 
5.1-30 acres: $550.00 
30.1 acres or more: $650.00 
4.  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 2-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed eighty dollars ($80.00) per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
5.  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. A district shall approve or disapprove a plan within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of a district to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 104.C.15. and 16. and bonding, if required as per subsection 105.B.7., have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. 
6.  If a permit applicant has had two (2) or more violations of previous permits, this ordinance section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three (3) years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
7.  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this ordinance or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
C.  Plan requirements. 
1.  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 104.B. and C. of this ordinance, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this ordinance. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
2, 3.  Reserved. 
4.  Maintenance of all soil erosion and sedimentation control practices, whether temporary or permanent, shall be at all times the responsibility of the property owner. 
D.  Permits. 
1.  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than forty-five (45) days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
2.  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion and sedimentation control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this ordinance, any variances required by subsections 104.C.15. and 16. are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection 105.B.7. are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
3.  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this ordinance, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
4.  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
5.  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this ordinance. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
6.  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two (2) or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three (3) years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
(Res. No. A-10-05, § 2, 9-20-10; Res. No. A-18-01, §§ 4—[6], 2-22-18) 
Sec. 106. - Inspection and enforcement. 
A.  The Spalding County Community Development Office, its successor or designee will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate both primary and secondary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this ordinance, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this ordinance. 
B.  The Spalding County Community Development Office, its successor or designee shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this ordinance, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
C.  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
D.  The districts or the commission or both shall periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The districts or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion and sedimentation control program. The districts or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
E.  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8 (a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found.

Sec. 103. - Findings and intent. 
Spalding County finds that the number, size, design characteristics, and locations of signs within Spalding County directly affect the public health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of Spalding County. The county finds that signs have become excessive, and that many signs are distracting and dangerous to motorists and pedestrians, are confusing to the public and do not relate to the premises on which they are located. Further, such signs substantially detract from the beauty and appearance of Spalding County. The county finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address those concerns through the adoption of this ordinance. The county states the following as a summary of the intent of this ordinance: 
1.  To protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of Spalding County, and to implement policies and objectives of this ordinance as a comprehensive plan for the regulation of signs within Spalding County. 
2.  To regulate the erection and placement of signs within Spalding County in order to provide safe operating conditions for pedestrian and vehicular traffic without unnecessary and unsafe distraction. 
3.  To preserve the value of property on which signs are located and from which signs may be viewed. 
4.  To maintain an aesthetically attractive county in which signs are compatible with the use patterns of established zoning districts. 
5.  To maintain for the citizens, residents, workers and visitors of Spalding County a safe and aesthetically attractive environment and to advance the aesthetic interests of the county. 
6.  To establish comprehensive sign regulations which effectively balance legitimate business and development needs with a safe and aesthetically attractive environment within Spalding County. 
7.  To provide fair and reasonable opportunities for the identification of businesses located within Spalding County, and to provide for the identification of products, goods or services which are available on site to promote the economic vitality of businesses and industries which are located within the county. 
8.  To insure the protection of free speech rights under the Constitution of the State of Georgia and the United States Constitution within Spalding County. 
9.  To establish a permit system to allow specific types of signs in zoning districts consistent with the uses, intent and aesthetic characteristics of those districts. 
10.  To allows certain signs that are small, safe, unobtrusive or incidental to the principal use of the property on which they are located, subject to the substantive requirements of this ordinance but without the requirement of a permit. 
11.  To provide fair and reasonable regulations governing signs such as billboards that do not identify products, goods or services provided on site and that are large and present significant safety and aesthetic concerns, by restricting such to specific traffic corridors and specific zoning districts suitable for the presentation of messages thereon to the traveling public, so as to protect the public's interest in safety, health and the general welfare. 
12.  To place reasonable controls on nonconforming signs that are by definition contrary to the public health, safety and general welfare while protecting the constitutional rights of the owners of such nonconforming signs. 
13.  To recognize the unique nature of signs and their impact on the use of property by imposing strict limitation on alterations to these regulations through administrative variance procedures. 
14.  To prohibit all signs not expressly authorized by this ordinance, to provide for the maintenance of signs, and to provide for the enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance.

Sec. 416. - Architectural and design standards. 
Objectives 
In an effort to maintain high quality, long-lasting and sustainable development within Spalding County, the County hereby adopts the following design criteria for all newly constructed nonresidential commercial, industrial and institutional buildings. They are intended to encourage an "old-town" look and feel of historical Georgia villages. These guidelines will foster architectural diversity and interest, yet achieve and maintain a consistent, durable and pleasing aesthetic/visual quality. 
The use of a common palate of building materials should be maintained for all buildings Facades to create a consistent and traditional architectural identity. Traditional architecture includes the use of red brick, pitched roofs, low-profile signage and subdued colors. For large commercial/retail buildings, variations in façade, roofline and depth should be provided to lend the appearance of multi-tenant occupancy. 
Facade elevations criteria 
Facade elevations submitted as an application for a development approval shall clearly indicate all of the proposed building materials and colors for each façade as described herein. The plans shall clearly show the location and calculate the amount/percentages of all building materials per facade. 
Groups of buildings on the same parcel of land may be reviewed and permitted as a single project rather than individual buildings. Grouping of similar buildings is encouraged to minimize the number of reviews required and to allow for originality and design flexibility. 
A.  Allowed building materials, retail, office, or institutional: Where the primary use of a development consists of retail, office or institutional uses the following facade material shall be allowed: 
Facade(s) visible to the general public: Brick, stone, split faced concrete masonry unit (CMU), cement plank (hardy-plank) siding, glass. 
Additional material allowed where facade(s) are not visible to the general public: Painted concrete block or painted formed concrete or prefabricated metal panel. 
B.  Allowed building materials, warehousing, manufacturing and other industrial: Where the primary use of a development consists of retail, office or institutional uses the following façade material shall be allowed: 
Facades facing public rights-of-way: Brick, stone, split faced concrete masonry unit (CMU), cement plank (hardy-plank) siding, glass. 
Additional material allowed where facade(s) are not visible from a public right-of-way: Painted concrete block or painted formed concrete or prefabricated metal panel. 
C.  Accent/trim exterior building material: Small amounts of building materials such as wood, tile, stucco, etc., may be used to enhance the elevation of the building or for decorative elements but may not exceed ten (10) percent of total wall area per facade. A building material that is allowed (such as brick) may be used in any percentage throughout the structure. Neon tubing or similar shaped light fixture is not an acceptable accent/trim treatment. 
Roof requirements 
A.  Pitched roofs: All one-story buildings less than ten thousand (10,000) gross square feet must have a pitched roof (between 4:12 and 12:12). If a pitched roof is not possible, a combination of flat roof and pitched roof is required. Provide a pitched roof on front and side of the building to screen view of any flat roof. Create arcades, drive-under canopies, porches and other features with pitched roof. Materials for pitched roofs shall be limited to architectural dimensional grade asphalt shingles, natural slate, natural terra cotta, natural wood shake, copper or factory finished sheet metal. 
B.  Mansard roofs: Mansard roofs shall have a maximum pitch of 12:12 with a minimum six-foot vertical surface length. 
C.  Flat roofs: Flat roofs may be of any material that meets local codes. Exposed metal flashing shall be copper or factory finished sheet metal. If factory finished metal flashing is used, such as standing seam, the color must be an earth tone color to blend with other materials or of a color to simulate weathered copper or bronze. All buildings with flat roofs should include parapet articulation on the front façade(s) of such building. There shall be roof articulations/offsets at a minimum of one per each one hundred twenty-five (125) linear feet of length by a change in the top line of the parapet. Additional articulation may occur at any lesser distance. If the front facade is less than one hundred twenty-five (125) linear feet, then a minimum of one roof articulation must occur. 
D.  Other: Drive under canopies for gasoline pumps shall have a pitched roof consistent with the pitched roof material requirements in paragraph A. The materials, ratio, and color of the gas canopies pitched roof shall be consistent with any associated primary structure. Where a full pitch is not possible, a hip roof or may be provided. In such situations, a minimum 3:12 roof pitch shall be maintained. 
Arcade/structural canopy for retail use 
For any multi-tenant commercial shopping center or strip center, a covered arcade/structural canopy shall be provided along the front façade of the building. Arcades are covered walkways connected to or separate from the principal building. They should be designed in a manner which provides architectural depth to the building and includes covered areas for relief from the weather. The arcade should be a minimum of five (5) feet in width. 
Venting/HVAC and other equipment 
All mechanical equipment, including rooftop equipment, fan units and vents that are generally associated with commercial, office and institutional used buildings shall be screened from public view. 
Temporary buildings 
Temporary buildings, mobile buildings, including, but not limited to trailers, campers and recreational vehicles and tents, shall not be allowed within public view with the exception of authorized dealerships of such buildings, street vendors and temporary trailers associated with approved construction projects. 
Buildings in excess of 30,000 square feet 
For one single story commercial building in excess of thirty thousand (30,000) square feet of floor area, the following design criteria shall apply in addition to those listed above: 
Facades should be articulated to reduce the massive scale and the uniform, impersonal appearances of large retail buildings and provide visual interest that will be consistent with the community's identity, character and scale. 
Facades greater than one hundred (100) feet in length, measured horizontally, shall incorporate wall plane projections or recesses having a depth of at least three (3) percent of the length of the facade and extending at least twenty (20) percent of the length of the facade. No uninterrupted length of any facade shall exceed one hundred (100) horizontal feet. 
Ground floor facades that face public streets shall have arcades, display windows, entry areas, awnings, or other such features along no less than sixty (60) percent of their horizontal length. 
Building facades must include a repeating pattern that shall include no less than three of the following elements: color change; texture change; material change; and expression of architectural or structural bay through a change in plane no less than twenty-four (24) inches in width, such as an offset, reveal, or projecting rib. All elements shall repeat at intervals of no more than thirty (30) feet, either horizontally or vertically. 
Alternate review 
Request to vary from the above requirements and alternative design proposals can only be approved by the Spalding County Board of Commissioners at a public meeting.
