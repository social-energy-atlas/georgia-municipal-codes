            <p>PREFACE                  This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of Seminole County, Georgia.
                  6/11/2019 Seminole County, GA Code of Ordinances
                  2/195
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the board of commissioners. The
                  source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note
                  indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables
                  appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance included herein.
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter
                  have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law
                  have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of
                  this Code.
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government
                  codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number,
                  and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is
                  numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the
                  same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new
                  material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section
                  would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be
                  placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article
                  embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included
                  by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained
                  when including new chapters.
                  Page Numbering System
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which
                  represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that
                  portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of
                  an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are
                  typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

                  Indexes
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some
                  of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local
                  government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as
                  guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested.
                  Looseleaf Supplements
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this
                  system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page
                  or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the
                  manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pa

                  or recognized and continued in force by reference therein, are repealed.
                  Section 3 The repeal provided for in section 2 hereof shall not be construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has
                  been repealed by a subsequent ordinance that is repealed by this ordinance.
                  Section 4 Unless another forfeiture is expressly provided, every person convicted of a violation of any provision of the Code or

                  By contract or by county personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared on an annual basis. A supplement
                  to the Code shall include all substantive, permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the board of
                  commissioners during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages
                  of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace
                  pages that have become obsolete or partially obsolete; and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they
                  have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in
                  the supplement.
                  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code that have been repealed shall be excluded from the
                  Code by their omission from reprinted pages.
                  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person authorized to prepare the
                  supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the
                  supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may:
                  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions.
                  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in
                  the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles.
                  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where
                  necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers.
                  Change the term "this ordinance" or terms of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division,"
                  etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ to ____________" (inserting section numbers to indicate the
                  sections of the Code that embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code).
                  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of ordinance sections
                  inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance
                  material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.
                  Sec. 1-10. - Altering Code.
                  It shall be unlawful for any person to change or amend, by additions or deletions, any part or portion of this Code or to insert
                  or delete pages or portions of this Code, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner whatsoever which will cause the law
                  of the county to be misrepresented thereby. Any person violating this section shall be punished as provided in section 1-12.

                  unincorporated association or organization, while acting within the scope of his office or employment, shall in every
                  case also be deemed to be a violation by the corporation, association or organization.
                  Any officer, agent or other person acting for or employed by any corporation or unincorporated association or
                  organization shall be subject and liable to punishment as well as the corporation or unincorporated association or
                  organization for the violation by it of any provisions of this Code, where the violation was the act or omission, or the
                  result of the act, omission or order, of any such person.

                  endanger the life or limb of any person lawfully entering such premises.
                  It shall be the duty of every owner of any vicious animal, or anyone having any such animal in his possession or

                  State waters means any and all rivers, streams, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainage systems, springs, wells,
                  and other bodies of surface or subsurface water, natural or artificial, lying within or forming a part of the boundaries of Georgia
                  which are not entirely confined and retained completely upon the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation.
                  Structural erosion, sedimentation and pollution control practices means practices for the stabilization of erodible or sedimentproducing areas by utilizing the mechanical properties of matter for the purpose of either changing the surface of the land or
                  storing, regulating or disposing of runoff to prevent excessive sediment loss. Examples of structural erosion and sediment control
                  practices are riprap, sediment basins, dikes, level spreaders, waterways or outlets, diversions, grade stabilization structures and
                  sediment traps, etc. Such practices can be found in the publication Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia.

                  Granite quarrying and land clearing for such quarrying;
                  Such minor land-disturbing activities as home gardens and individual home landscaping, repairs, maintenance
                  work, fences, and other related activities which result in minor soil erosion;
                  The construction of single-family residences, when such construction disturbs less than one acre and is not a
                  part of a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than
                  one acre and not otherwise exempted under this paragraph; provided, however, that construction of any such
                  residence shall conform to the minimum requirements as set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 and this paragraph. For
                  single-family residence construction covered by the provisions of this paragraph, there shall be a buffer zone
                  between the residence and any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of
                  the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. In any such buffer zone, no land-disturbing activity shall be constructed
                  between the residence and the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave
                  action from the banks of the trout waters. For primary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50
                  horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. For secondary trout waters, the buffer
                  zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, but the director may grant variances to no less than 25 feet.
                  Regardless of whether a trout stream is primary or secondary, for first order trout waters, which are streams
                  into which no other streams flow except for springs, the buffer shall be at least 25 horizontal feet, and no
                  variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. The minimum requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b) and the buffer
                  zones provided by this paragraph shall be enforced by the local issuing authority;

                  erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the
                  erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and
                  practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of
                  measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage
                  facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control
                  erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with
                  requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit.
                  Minimum requirements/BMPs.
                  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all landdisturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall
                  constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with
                  paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of
                  storm water issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this
                  subsection the terms proper design and properly designed mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic
                  design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in
                  O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b).
                  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been
                  properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit
                  issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. §
                  12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the
                  turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters
                  supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as
                  trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be
                  issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction
                  of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned
                  disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
                  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any
                  land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division
                  pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure
                  occurs.
                  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent
                  monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur.
                  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15) and (c)(16), in light of
                  O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c).
                  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose
                  of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state
                  general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent
                  and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those
                  practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and
                  Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as
                  well as the following:
                  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to
                  minimize erosion;
                  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
                  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion

                  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
                  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
                  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
                  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable;
                  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment
                  basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a
                  disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements
                  of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.;
                  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations
                  or the sloping of fills;
                  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
                  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely
                  affect other property owners;
                  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods
                  are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum;
                  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for
                  treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain
                  sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2)
                  of this section;
                  Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of
                  all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal
                  stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as
                  protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to
                  O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided
                  that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are
                  implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a
                  stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after
                  precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year round; for which
                  groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water
                  flow, unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to
                  part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a
                  variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any
                  such buffer:
                  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural,
                  undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed.
                  Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as
                  long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural
                  canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person
                  constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the
                  owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as
                  protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is
                  left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and

                  point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not mor
                  the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specification
                  implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and
                  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been
                  wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout
                  streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a
                  roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified
                  as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot
                  buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a
                  general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream
                  landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams.
                  The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate
                  erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The
                  following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
                  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural,
                  undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed.
                  Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as
                  long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural
                  canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person
                  constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the
                  owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as
                  protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is
                  left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
                  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle,
                  as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width
                  of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are
                  incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for
                  water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines.
                  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and
                  regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum
                  requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section.
                  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another

                  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of Seminole County with
                  obtaining a permit from the Seminole County Building and Zoning office to perform such activity and providing a
                  intent submitted to EPD if applicable.
                  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the Seminole County Building and Zoning office and must
                  include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary.
                  Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion,
                  sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that
                  the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections
                  26-34(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by
                  two copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a
                  certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan
                  in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10.
                  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(5)(a), provided
                  that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated
                  and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing
                  activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid
                  prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-
                  8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity
                  which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the
                  division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction.
                  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the
                  application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the
                  erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35
                  days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan.
                  The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued
                  unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 26-34(c)(15) and
                  (c)(16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6), have been
                  obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an
                  agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without
                  referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall
                  approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority
                  with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal.
                  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and
                  Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under
                  consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application.
                  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security,
                  cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or
                  fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not
                  comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call
                  the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site
                  of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in
                  effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or
                  order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations.
                  Plan requirements.
                  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 26-34(b) and (c) of

                  Permits.
                  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by
                  the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where
                  necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions
                  under which the activity may be undertaken.
                  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control
                  plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the
                  plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsections 26-34(c)(15) and (c)(16) are
                  obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules
                  and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the
                  permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant.
                  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this
                  ordinance, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the
                  division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority.
                  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase.
                  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of
                  the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with
                  the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation
                  of this ordinance. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the
                  land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit.
                  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or

                  The Seminole County Building and Zoning office will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for
                  which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if
                  the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing
                  authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general
                  permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices
                  where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for

                  permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in landdisturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with
                  the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth
                  the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be
                  completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be
                  deemed in violation of this article.
                  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any
                  amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975.
                  The Seminole County Building and Zoning office shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may
                  reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this ordinance, and for this purpose to enter at
                  reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of
                  land-disturbing activities.
                  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the
                  commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents
                  appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in
                  the process of carrying out his official duties.
                  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which
                  have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or
                  both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness
                  of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the
                  commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local
                  program is found.
                  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local
                  issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of
                  the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an
                  agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing
                  authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced
                  its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to
                  O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The
                  governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary
                  corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take
                  necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification
                  of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity
                  requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall
                  be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business
                  and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority.
                  Stop-work orders.
                  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority
                  shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the

                  order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has
                  occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of
                  the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director
                  or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning;
                  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate
                  stop-work order; and;
                  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary
                  corrective action or mitigation has occurred.
                  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or
                  significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her
                  designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not
                  been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing
                  authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop-work orders shall be effective immediately
                  upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stopwork orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and
                  maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls.
                  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed
                  to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set
                  forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such
                  measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time
                  specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have
                  forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of subsection 26-35(b)(6). The local
                  issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a
                  contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance.

                  ARTICLE III. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREA PROTECTION
                  Sec. 26-71. - Findings of fact and objectives.
                  In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the county
                  and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it
                  is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that the county and surrounding communities rely on as
                  sources of public water. Groundwater resources are contained within aquifers, which are permeable, rock strata
                  occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in
                  zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when
                  unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to
                  manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized.
                  The objectives of this article are to protect groundwater quality by:
                  Restricting land uses that generate, use or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas;
                  Limiting density of development; and
                  Ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse affect on
                  groundwater quality.

                  A groundwater recharge area district is established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the county that
                  are mapped as significant recharge areas by the department of natural resources in Hydrologic Atlas 20, 1992 edition. Each
                  recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium or low based on the state pollution
                  susceptibility map, Hydrologic Atlas 20, 1992 edition. Such map is adopted and made a part of this article.

                  Sec. 26-73. - Denitions.
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section,
                  except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
                  Aquifer means any stratum or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a
                  well.
                  Drastic means the standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings
                  described in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency document EPA-600/2-87-035. (Note: The drastic methodology is the most
                  widely used technique for evaluating pollution susceptibility.)
                  Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharges, leaks,
                  impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area.
                  Pollution susceptibility maps means maps of relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the department of natural
                  resources. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas having high, medium and low
                  groundwater pollution potential.
                  Recharge area means any portion of the earth's surface, where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer.
                  Significant recharge areas means those areas mapped by the department of natural resources in the state pollution
                  susceptibility map, Hydrologic Atlas 20, 1992 edition. Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology, soil type and
                  thickness, slope, density of lithologic contracts, geologic structure, the presence of karst, and potentiometric surfaces. Significant
                  recharge areas for the county are typified by those of the coastal plain. In the coastal plain, the significant recharge areas are the
                  surface outcroppings of the large and extensively used drinking water aquifers (e.g., the Floridan, the Clayton, etc.) and soils having
                  high permeability according to the 1976 1:750,000 soils association map of the state.

                  The following criteria shall apply in significant recharge areas:
                  The county shall not issue any permits for new sanitary landfills not having synthetic liners and leachate
                  collection systems.
                  The county shall not issue any new permits for the land disposal of hazardous wastes.
                  The county shall require all new facilities permitted or to be permitted to treat, store, or dispose of hazardous
                  waste to perform such operations on an impermeable pad having a spill and leak collection system.
                  New aboveground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660 gallons, shall have
                  secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the
                  largest tank in a cluster of tanks. (Note: These figures are consistent with US EPA rules for oil pollution

                  unnecessary hardship. However, the spirit of this article must be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial
                  justice done; provided that the variance, if granted, will not result in damage to the groundwater.

                  Sec. 26-112. - Establishment of protected river corridor district.
                  River corridor district. This article shall apply to all land, inclusive of islands, being within 100 feet horizontally on the
                  county side of the Chattahoochee River as measured from the river banks. Also included is the area between the top
                  of the bank and the edge of the river although this strip of land is not included as part of the 100-foot buffer
                  requirement contained in the minimum standards.
                  Map. The generalized corridor map, adopted as part of this article, shows the general locations of the protected
                  river corridor and such map should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near the protected areas.
                  The generalized corridor map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is adopted by
                  reference and declared to be a part of this article. Such map shall be on file in the county administrator's office and
                  the zoning administrator's office.
                  Development permits required. No regulated activity will be allowed within the protected Chattahoochee River
                  Corridor District without written permission from the county zoning department in the form of a local development
                  permit. Issuance of a local development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this article and
                  other applicable regulations.

                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section,
                  except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
                  Hazardous waste means any solid waste which has been defined as a hazardous waste in regulations, promulgated by the
                  administrator or his designee of the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the federal action, which are in
                  force and effect on February 1, 1988, codified as 40 CFR 261.3. (Note: This is the same definition as used in the Georgia Hazardous
                  Waste Management Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-8-60 et seq.)
                  Land disturbing activity means any grading, scraping, excavating, or filling of land; clearing of vegetation; and any construction,
                  rebuilding, or alteration of a structure. Land disturbing activity shall not include activities such as ordinary maintenance and
                  landscaping operations, repairs, additions or minor modifications to a single-family dwelling, and the cutting of firewood for
                  personal use.
                  Land uses existing prior to the promulgation of a Chattahoochee River Corridor Protection District means any land use or land
                  disturbing activity, including all human endeavors prior to the promulgation of the Chattahoochee River Corridor Protection
                  District, which falls within one of the following categories:
                  Is completed;
                  Is under construction;
                  Is fully approved by the governing authority;
                  All materials have been submitted for approval by the governing authority; or
                  Is zoned, if applicable, for such use and expenditures in excess of $2,500.00 have been made in preparation for
                  construction in accordance with such zoning.
                  Local government means the board of commissioners.
                  Natural vegetative buffer and buffer area mean a river corridor containing the flora native to that area. The natural floras for
                  specific areas are described in the state geologic survey bulletin 114, The Natural Environments of Georgia. Habitats for
                  endangered and threatened species may require human management of the river corridor in order to maintain those species.
                  Perennial river means a river or section of a river that flows continuously throughout the year.
                  Plan and comprehensive plan mean any plan by the county covering such county prepared pursuant to the minimum planning

                  Port facility means any facility for the docking, loading and unloading of ships.
                  Protected river means any perennial river or watercourse with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second as
                  determined by appropriate U.S. Geological Survey documents. However, those segments of rivers covered by the Metropolitan
                  River Protection Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq.) or the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-280 et seq.) are
                  specifically excluded from the definition of a protected river. In coastal areas, the seaward limit of any protected river shall be the
                  inland limit of the jurisdiction of the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act.
                  Public utility and utilities mean services provided by a public utility company or a private entity which provides such services,
                  and all equipment and structures necessary to provide such services.

                  Quadrangle map means the most recently published U.S. Geological Survey 7.5-minute topographic map prepared at a scale of
                  1:24,000.
                  River bank means the rising ground, bordering a river, which services to confine the water to the natural channel during the
                  normal course of flow.
                  River corridor means all land, inclusive of islands, not regulated under the Metropolitan River Protection Act (O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-
                  440—12-5-457), or the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act (O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-280—12-5-293), in areas of a protected river and being
                  within 100 feet horizontally on both sides of the river as measured from the river banks. The 100-foot buffer shall be measured
                  horizontally from the uppermost part of the river bank, usually marked by a break in slope. Although not within the measured 100-
                  foot wide buffer, the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river shall be treated by local governments in the same
                  manner as the river corridor and shall be included within the Chattahoochee River Corridor Protection District. Because stream
                  channels move due to natural processes such as meandering, river bank erosion, and jumping of channels, the river corridor may
                  shift with time. For the purposes of these standards, the river corridor shall be considered to be fixed at its position at the
                  beginning of each review period for local comprehensive plans. Any shift in the location of the protected river after the start of the
                  review period will require a revision of the boundaries of the river corridor at the times of the next review by the department of
                  community affairs.
                  Sensitive natural area means any area, as identified now or hereafter by the department of natural resources, which contains
                  one or more of the following:
                  Habitat, including nesting sites, occupied by rare or endangered species;
                  Rare or exemplary natural communities;
                  Significant land forms, hydroforms, or geological features; or
                  Other areas so designated by the department of natural resources; and which is sensitive or vulnerable to
                  physical or biological alteration.
                  Single-family dwelling means a dwelling structure that is designed for the use of one family.

                  more than $10,000.00 for each offense. Each violation of this article shall be a separate offense, and, in the case of a
                  continuing violation, each day's continuance shall be deemed to be a separate and distinct offense.
                  When a building or other structure has been constructed in violation of this article, the violator may be required to
                  remove the structure, at the discretion of the county commission.
                  When removal of vegetative cover, excavation or fill has taken place in violation of this article, the violator may be
                  required to restore the affected land to its original contours and to restore vegetation, as far as practicable, at the
                  discretion of the county commission.
                  The county commission may suspend or revoke a permit if it finds that the applicant has not complied with the
                  conditions or limitations set forth in the permit or has exceeded the scope of the work set forth in the permit.

                  The dwelling shall be in compliance with all local zoning regulations.
                  The dwelling shall be located on a tract of land containing at least one and one-half acres. For the
                  purposes of these standards, the size of the tract of land shall not include any area that lies within the
                  protected river (that is, for tracts of land that include portions of a protected river, the area between the
                  river banks cannot be counted towards the 1½ acre minimum size).
                  There shall be only one such dwelling on each one and one-half acre or larger tract of land.
                  A septic tank serving such a dwelling may be located within the buffer area.

                  Industrial and commercial land uses existing prior to the promulgation of the river corridor protection district
                  are exempt from these criteria provided that:
                  Industrial and commercial uses of river corridors shall not impair the drinking quality of the river water;
                  and
                  Industrial and commercial activity within the river corridor shall meet all state and federal environmental
                  rules and regulations.
                  Road crossings and utility crossings (meeting all requirements of the Erosion and Sedimentation Control Act of

                  ARTICLE V. - WETLANDS PROTECTION
                  Sec. 26-151. - Findings and purpose.
                  The wetlands within the county are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development
                  constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature.
                  They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood
                  control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; open space; and recreational opportunities. In
                  addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities
                  within the state. Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired
                  by draining, dredging, filling, excavation, building, pollution, and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over
                  time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general
                  welfare. The state department of natural resources and the state department of community affairs have determined
                  that each local government with classified wetlands located in its jurisdiction must adopt a wetlands protection
                  ordinance under the requirements of House Bill 215, the state's 1989 Growth Strategies Legislation and the rules
                  promulgated thereunder.
                  This article shall be known as the wetlands protection ordinance of the county. The purpose of this article is to
                  promote wise use of wetlands and protect wetlands, while taking into account varying ecological, economic
                  development, recreational and aesthetic values. The objective of this article is to make the public aware of state and
                  federal laws that protect wetlands from alterations which will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions
                  for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic nature and wildlife.

                  to support, and under normal circumstances does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil
                  conditions, commonly known as hydrophytic vegetation. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas.
                  Wetland delineation means the establishment of wetland boundaries by a representative of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
                  or any authority designated by the Corps.

                  violation to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the landowner.
                  The county or its designee may suspend or revoke a registration, as described in section 26-155, if it finds that the
                  applicant has not complied with the conditions or limitations set forth in the permit or has exceeded the scope of
                  the work set forth in the permit. The county or its designee may cause notice of its denial, issuance, conditional
                  issuance, revocation or suspension of a permit to be published in a daily newspaper having a broad circulation in

                  Generalized wetland map. This article shall apply to all wetlands within the wetland protection district and located with
                  jurisdiction of the county. The generalized wetland map, adopted as part of this article, shows the general location of w
                  and of the wetland protection district and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands
                  engaging in a regulated activity. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attach
                  is adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the off
                  county.
                  Boundaries. The generalized wetland map is a general reference document and wetland boundaries indicated on
                  the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they
                  are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdiction
                  wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' guidance as to whether a
                  section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not necessarily
                  represent the exact boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the county, and cannot serve as a
                  substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404
                  of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner
                  from federal or state permitting requirements.
                  (Ord. of 8-14-2001(3), § 3)
                  Sec. 26-155. - Local development registration.
                  Requirements. No regulated activity will be conducted within the wetland protection district without registration
                  with the board of commissioners or its designee. All activities that are not exempted in subsection (b) of this section
                  shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a local registration. If the area proposed for development is located
                  within 50 feet of the wetland protection district boundary, as determined from the generalized wetland map, a U.S.
                  Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determines that
                  wetlands are present and that a section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, a local development permit
                  will be issued only following issuance of the section 404 permit or letter of permission.
                  Issuance of local permit. A local permit shall be issued without a jurisdictional wetlands determination by the
                  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers if either one of the following two conditions exist:
                  It is not the type of activity that would cause the alteration of wetlands; or
                  The proposed location of the activity is not near or within a protected wetland boundary as shown on the
                  generalized wetlands map adopted by the county as a part of this article.
                  Deferment of local permit. Issuance of a local permit shall be deferred pending a jurisdictional wetland
                  determination by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This determination is required when a proposed activity is
                  of a type that would cause alteration of wetlands and the proposed location of the activity is near or within a
                  wetland boundary. A deferred local permit will be issued after a letter of permission or section 404 permit is
                  obtained from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers by the applicant.
                  Permissible uses (use as a right). The following uses shall be allowed as a right within the wetland protection district
                  to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require
                  structures, grading, fill, drainage or dredging except as provided in this subsection:
                  Operations conducted during normal silvicultural activities, including minor dredge and fill associated with
                  road construction, harvesting, and reforestation practices provided they meet the performance standards and
                  road construction best management practices required under section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
                  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided they do not affect
                  waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit.
                  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and
                  canoeing.

                  commencement of work, written notice has been given to the board of commissioners or its designee and
                  provided that the work is conducted using best management practices to ensure that flow and circulation
                  patterns, and chemical and biological characteristics of the wetland, are not impaired and that any adverse
                  effect on the aquatic environment will be minimized.
                  Temporary water level stabilization measures associated with silvicultural operations, provided that they are
                  necessary to alleviate abnormally wet or dry conditions that would have an adverse impact on the conduct of
                  silvicultural activities if not corrected.
                  Limited ditching, tilling, dredging, excavating or filling done solely for the purpose of maintaining or repairing
                  existing drainage systems necessary for the cultivation of agricultural crops, provided that the maintenance or
                  repair activity does not result in the impairment, alteration or loss of wetlands not previously subject to
                  agricultural and silvicultural use under the terms and provisions of this subsection.

                  ARTICLE VII. - TIMBER HARVESTING ORDINANCE
                  Sec. 26-221. - Requirements.
                  Any individual, partnership, corporation or any other entity (hereinafter called "Harvester") who harvests standing timber in
                  any unincorporated area of the County for delivery as pulpwood, logs, poles, posts or wood chips to any wood yard or processing
                  plant located inside or outside this state will be required to perform the following:
                  The harvester shall obtain a timber harvesting permit from the Seminole County Board of Commissioner's
                  office prior to start-up (moving in of equipment or cutting of any trees). Said notification will be on such permit
                  form as approved and provided by the board of commissioners.
                  The harvester shall post an annual cash bond, surety bond or irrevocable letter of credit as provided for in this
                  paragraph, in the amount of $5,000.00. The purpose of the bond is to insure that all damages to roadways,
                  ditches, or rights-of-way be corrected and said areas left at least in the same condition as existing immediately
                  prior to the operations start-up. Notice shall not be or remain effective for such harvesting operations unless
                  and until the person or firm providing such notice has delivered to the governing authority or its designated
                  agent a valid surety bond, executed by a surety corporation authorized to transact business in this state,
                  protecting the county against any damage caused by harvester.
                  In order to preserve county roadways, some job sites may require the installation of a temporary entrance/exit
                  driveway. The determination for such a driveway will be made by the county road department superintendent.
                  The county shall loan the harvester the driveway culvert pipe necessary to build the driveway. The harvester
                  must install the driveway pipe and provide soil and any other necessary materials to bring the ingress/egress
                  point to build a reliable driveway. No roadside ditches can be filled in to provide the ingress/egress. A culvert
                  pipe must be used to prevent the blockage of stormwater. At the conclusion of harvesting the site, the
                  harvester will notify the county commissioner's office and the county road department will remove and retain
                  the pipe.
                  If the harvester fails to return the roadways, ditches or rights-of-way to a state at least equal to that existing
                  immediately prior to the instituting of the harvesting process, the Board of Commissioners of Seminole County
                  shall cause the repairs to be made and deduct the costs for the same from the posted bond.
                  If the harvester causes no damages and/or upon his satisfactory completion of necessary repairs, the bond
                  shall be released to the harvester at year end following inspection of all sites by the county road department
                  superintendent. Harvester shall notify the county tax assessors' office of actual completion date on each site.

                  of county roads.
                  Loading or skidding of logs will not be permitted on county roads.
                  Ditches shall be kept clear of all debris or residue at all times to allow for proper drainage.
                  County roads at the access site shall be kept serviceable at all times for the passing public, emergency vehicles,
                  school buses, mail carriers, etc.
                  The county road department superintendent has the authority to close down all operations when it is determined
                  that the county roads and access sites are not being properly maintained. Such notice shall be in writing and shall
                  be given to the person or persons in charge of the activity at the harvesting site and shall state the conditions under
                  which the work may be resumed. When an emergency exists, the sheriff or code enforcement officer is authorized
                  to stop work with no written notice.

                  Editor's note— Ord. of Sept. 8, 2009, arts. 1—6, amended Art. II in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. II, §§ 30-31

                  Sec. 30-31. - Authorization.
                  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to
                  local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
                  Therefore, the Seminole County Commission of Donalsonville, Georgia, does ordain as follows.
                  (Ord. of 9-8-2009, art. 1, § A)
                  Sec. 30-32. - Findings of fact.
                  The flood hazard areas of Seminole County, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life
                  and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
                  expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
                  health, safety and general welfare.
                  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are
                  inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect
                  of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.

                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private
                  losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
                  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood
                  damage at the time of initial construction;
                  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards,
                  or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
                  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
                  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may
                  increase flood hazards to other lands; and
                  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are
                  involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  Sec. 30-111. - General standards.
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required:
                  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation,
                  collapse or lateral movement of the structure;
                  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and
                  utility equipment resistant to flood damage;
                  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and
                  practices that minimize flood damage;
                  Elevated buildings. All New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any
                  fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be
                  designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize
                  hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater.
                  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or

                  every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
                  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and
                  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they
                  permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions.
                  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
                  shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection
                  with the premises, or entry to the elevated area, and
                  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
                  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation,
                  plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or
                  accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
                  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of
                  anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This
                  standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable State requirements for resisting wind forces.
                  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of
                  floodwaters into the system;
                  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of
                  floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters;
                  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or
                  contamination from them during flooding, and;
                  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the
                  provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  forth above and in subsection 30-83(6).
                  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available:
                  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on:
                  Individual lots or parcels;
                  In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions;
                  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or
                  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has
                  incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including
                  basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation.
                  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or
                  subdivision may be elevated so that either:
                  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of
                  the base flood elevation; or
                  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation
                  elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade.
                  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to
                  resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. subsection 30-111(6), above).
                  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
                  Be on the site for fewer than 30 consecutive days;
                  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is
                  licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities
                  and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or
                  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the
                  anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections (3)a. and (3)c., above.
                  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 30-52, are areas designated as
                  floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion
                  potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the
                  base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
                  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or
                  other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it
                  is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard
                  engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway
                  widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting
                  technical data and certification thereof.
                  Only if subsection (4)a. above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall
                  comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 4.

                  been provided (A-Zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following
                  provisions apply:
                  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 30-52,
                  then the local administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood
                  elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the
                  provisions of division 4. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2) and
                  (3) shall apply:
                  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of
                  the stream or twenty feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification
                  by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in
                  more than a one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
                  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial
                  improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
                  basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (NOTE:
                  Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-Zone areas
                  where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements
                  of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 30-111(4) "elevated buildings".
                  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical,
                  ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the
                  highest adjacent grade at the building site.
                  The local administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the
                  permit file.

                  provided but no floodways have been designated, (Zones AE) the following provisions apply:
                  No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial improvements shall be located within
                  areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided
                  demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing
                  and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one
                  foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data
                  that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
                  New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or flood-proofed to elevations

                  appeals or variance from the requirements of this article.
                  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination
                  is made by the local administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article.
                  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the zoning board may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of
                  Seminole County, Georgia as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1.
                  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the
                  proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
                  the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
                  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the
                  criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that
                  minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
                  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
                  discharge would result.
                  In reviewing such requests, the zoning board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all
                  standards specified in this and other sections of this article.
                  Conditions for variances:
                  A variance shall be issued only when there is:
                  A finding of good and sufficient cause;
                  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
                  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional
                  threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of
                  the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
                  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the
                  standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
                  the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic
                  structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic
                  character and design of the building.
                  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between
                  the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood
                  insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest
                  floor elevation.
                  The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal
                  Emergency Management Agency upon request.
                  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the zoning board may attach such
                  conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and
                  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational,
                  camping, travel, or seasonal use.
                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
                  reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent
                  construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work
                  beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction
                  does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or
                  walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor
                  does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not

                  89/195
                  occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: Accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance
                  requirements). For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor,
                  or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage
                  tank.

                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its
                  before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place
                  during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to
                  the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be: (1) the appraised value of the
                  structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the
                  damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of
                  repair work performed.
                  For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling,
                  floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the
                  building. The term does not, however, include: (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of
                  state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which
                  have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any
                  alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
                  structure".
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or
                  improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the
                  repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited
                  by this article.
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain
                  management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other
                  evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  Sec. 38-33. - Procedures for rezoning property requests.
                  Procedures for rezoning property requests by citizens or property owners shall be as follows:
                  An application for rezoning must be filed with the zoning administrator on a prescribed form and fees paid as
                  set by the board of commissioners. The application shall be filed 30 days prior to the planning commission
                  meeting.
                  The zoning administrator will inform the applicant of the public hearing dates. The planning commission will
                  convene a public hearing on each rezoning proposal. However, the official public hearing will be held by the
                  board of commissioners and public notice will appear no less than 15 days nor more than 45 days prior to the
                  official public hearing. (Note: the planning commission makes recommendations to the board of
                  commissioners. The final zoning decision lies with the board of commissioners.)
                  Official public hearing notices will be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the county at least
                  15 days prior to the official public hearing date.
                  The public hearing notice will name the applicant, the location of property to be affected, the present zoning
                  classification, the proposed zoning classification and the date, time and place of both the planning commission
                  public hearing and the public hearing held by the board of commissioners.
                  The zoning administrator shall also have erected upon the property for which rezoning is to be considered, a
                  sign of no less than 17 inches by 24 inches announcing the public hearings, stipulating the dates, times, and
                  places for the two hearings, the present zoning classification and the proposed zoning classification. The sign
                  shall be seen clearly from a public street. It shall be erected not less than 15 days before the public hearing
                  date (board of commissioners).

                  Sec. 38-34. - Public hearing procedures.
                  Public hearing procedures for rezoning proposals shall be as follows:
                  The presider of each respective public hearing will review for those present, the following operating
                  procedures for the public hearing:
                  In order for a person in attendance to speak, the chair must recognize him. The person recognized will
                  identify himself. The chair may also request that the person furnish a home or business street address, as
                  appropriate.
                  A minimum of ten minutes per side (proponents and opponents) will be allowed for discussion. The
                  applicant or an authorized representative of the applicant will be given the option of speaking first at the
                  hearing.
                  Additional persons will be recognized per the procedures of this section for the purpose of addressing
                  additional concerns of the revisions or to make additional points with regard to elements already
                  addressed, but not to rehash points already made.
                  Appropriate notes or minutes will be recorded by the planning commission and the board of
                  commissioners at their respective public hearings.
                  The public hearing held by the planning commission will follow the same meeting procedures as that of the
                  board of commissioners.
                  The planning commission shall prepare and submit the necessary minutes, evaluations and/or
                  recommendations to the board of commissioners prior to the county commissioners public hearing.
                  The board of commissioners, at its public hearing, will review the evaluation and recommendations from the
                  planning commission and may choose to adopt or reject or modify the planning commission
                  recommendations or the business may be tabled for additional study to the next regular commission meeting
                  with the consent of the applicant.
                  Any application for rezoning of a particular parcel of property, which is denied by the board of commissioners,
                  may not again be considered for rezoning until the expiration of at least 12 months immediately following the
                  defeat of the rezoning request.
                  (Ord. of 8-14-2001(4))
                  Sec. 38-35. - Rezoning criteria.
                  When the county or an individual initiates a rezoning of property, the criteria for determining whether or not to recommend
                  the approval or denial of in the case of the planning commission, or whether to approve or deny a rezoning application request in
                  the case of the board of commissioners, is based on the criteria set forth in this section. The following criteria are established to
                  assist the planning commission and board of commissioners in balancing the interests of the public with the interests of the
                  private property owner:
                  Does the proposed zoning classification promote the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the county?
                  The existing uses of the subject property and the adjacent and nearby properties.
                  The current zoning of the subject property and zoning of adjacent or nearby properties.
                  The extent to which the property values are diminished by the present zoning restrictions.
                  The extent to which the restrictions diminishing the property's values promote the health, safety, morals or
                  general welfare of the public.

                  The history of the use of the subject property considered in the context of land developments in the vicinity of
                  the property.

                  Sec. 38-36. - Conditional uses.
                  Approval. The county planning commission may recommend approval of a rezoning proposal under this article to
                  the board of commissioners on conditional uses, which are specifically authorized. The board will make the final
                  decision. The procedures and application process is the same as in a rezoning. A public hearing is required.
                  Conditional use criteria.
                  The proposed use will not constitute a nuisance or hazard because of the number of persons who will attend
                  or use such facility, vehicular movement, noise or fume generation or type of physical activity.
                  The proposed use will not be affected adversely by the existing uses; and the proposed use will be placed on a
                  lot of sufficient size to satisfy the space requirements of such use.
                  The parking and all development standards set forth for each particular use for which a permit may be granted
                  have been met.
                  The board of commissioners may impose or require such additional restrictions and standards as may be
                  necessary to protect the health and safety of workers and residents in the community and to protect the value
                  and use of property in the general neighborhood provided that, wherever the county commission shall find, in
                  the case of any permit granted pursuant to the provisions of the regulations of this article, that any term of the
                  permit has not been complied with, the commission shall rescind and revoke such permit after giving due
                  notice to all parties concerned and granting full opportunity for a public hearing.
                  (Ord. of 8-14-2001(4))
                  Sec. 38-37. - Variances.
                  The planning commission may recommend approval of a variance from the provisions of this article to the board of
                  commissioners which shall have the power to authorize such variance from the terms of the zoning regulations as will not be
                  contrary to the public interest, where a literal enforcement of the zoning requirements would result in undue hardship.
                  Procedure. Applications for a variance shall be filed with the office of the zoning administrator. Such
                  application must be filed 30 days before the date of the following planning commission meeting in order that
                  the required public notice may be given before the next scheduled meeting. Each application shall be
                  accompanied by a simple sketch of the site, showing the following:
                  General location of existing structures and property lines.
                  Location of proposed buildings and land use.
                  Setback if applicable to the request.
                  Public hearing. A public hearing shall be held by the board of commissioners for the review of an application
                  for a variance. Notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published at least 15 days before the
                  hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the county.
                  Fee. Each application for a variance shall be accompanied by an application fee set by the board of
                  commissioners to partially defray administrative costs.

                  Sec. 38-38. - Criteria for variance requests.
                  The following criteria shall be utilized when considering specific cases where the variance from the terms of this article will not
                  be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this article will, in an
                  individual case, result in unnecessary hardship so that the spirit of this article shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured
                  and substantial justice done. Such variances may be granted in such individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a finding of the
                  board of commissioners that:
                  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question
                  and because of its size, shape or topography.
                  The application of this article to this particular piece of property would create an undue hardship.
                  Such conditions are particular to the particular piece of property involved and not the making of the applicant.
                  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good, or impair the purposes and intent
                  of this article; however, no variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited
                  by this article.
                  The proposed use will be of such location, size and character that it will be in harmony with the appropriate
                  and orderly development of the surrounding neighborhood.
                  The proposed use will be a nature that will make vehicular and pedestrian traffic no more hazardous than is
                  normal for the district involved.
                  The location, size intensity, site layout and periods of operation of any such proposed use will be designed to
                  eliminate any possible nuisance emanating from the use which might be noxious to the occupants of any other

                  The hours of each day the event will be conducted;

                  and equipment.
                  (Ord. of 10-13-2009)
                  Sec. 40-5. - Review by the county commission and the sheri
                  All public parades, picketing and demonstrations that take place on Seminole County property shall be by permit
                  only.
                  The Seminole County Commission will have the ultimate responsibility to accept or deny permits for conduct in
                  public spaces and facilities (hereinafter referred to as the "event") in the unincorporated areas or any owned or
                  controlled property of Seminole County.
                  The sheriff will have the final determination for the amount of the cash bond necessary to cover the cost of law
                  enforcement personnel; fire safety; and EMS services necessary to assure for a peaceful event and to provide for
                  the safety of the citizens of Seminole County.
                  Due to the limited number of combined law enforcement availability, no two public assemblies may take place in
                  the same locale on the same day. The first organizer to apply for such permit will have priority over any subsequent
                  application unless such application is scheduled on a date recognized as being a date of a continuing or annual
                  event.
                  Within five working days of the receipt of a fully completed, executed, and filed application, the county commission
                  shall review the application in light of all of the contents thereof and the goals, intentions, and presumptions of this
                  chapter as set out hereinbefore, and render a decision and communicate same to applicant, either permitting the
                  event as planned or denying a permit for same. If the permit is denied, the commission shall provide the applicant
                  in writing a statement of the reasons therefore. (First class mail to the address provided by applicant, postmarked
                  no more than five working days after receipt of the fully completed, executed, and filed application, shall be
                  sufficient for this purpose, though not the exclusive means of notice.)
                  Nothing in this process shall prevent the commission, at their sole option and within the five working day period for
                  approval or denial, to confer with applicant with respect to modifications of applicant's plan for the event, and
                  amend the application to reflect such modifications if agreed to by applicant. However, applicant may neither
                  supplement nor amend its application within said five working day period except at the invitation of the
                  commission. Any attempt to do so sua sponte shall be deemed a separate and new application.
                  The commission may deny the application for permit upon any of the following reasons or combination of reasons:
                  The application does not contain all required information or materials, or the information set out in the
                  application is so incomplete, vague, or ambiguous as to prevent full and proper review by the commission;
                  The application contains material omissions, falsehoods, or misrepresentations;
                  The applicant, or entity represented by applicant, is incompetent to contract, sue, or be sued;
                  The person applying lacks authority to represent the entity for which the application is made;

                  violation of any injunction or restraining order entered against the applicant or entity, whether under the same na
                  The applicant or entity represented by applicant has on prior occasions violated permitting ordinances in
                  connection with events of a substantially similar nature;
                  The plan of the event as proposed is likely to present a danger to the health or safety of participants in the
                  event or other members of the public (though not through the agency of any predicted reaction by onlookers
                  or members of the public);
                  The plan of the event as proposed is likely to restrict and/or congest traffic (vehicular or pedestrian) on any of
                  the public roads, rights-of-way, sidewalks, or waterways in the immediate vicinity of such event;
                  The plan of the event as proposed is likely to cause a disturbance of the peace, or is likely to burden lawful
                  commerce in the area at the time of the proposed event, or is likely to intrude upon the privacy or property of
                  citizens in the area of the proposed event;
                  The plan of the event as proposed includes activities which are prohibited by laws of the United States, the
                  State of Georgia, or ordinances of Seminole County, or activities which constitute nuisance or tortious conduct
                  with respect to public or private property or persons;
                  The plan of the event as proposed would conflict with previously planned programs or events organized and
                  conducted by Seminole County and previously scheduled for the same time and place;
                  The plan of the event as proposed is prohibited by or is inconsistent with the classifications and uses of the
                  proposed or desired location;
                  A fully executed prior application for permit has been or will be granted to a prior applicant; or
                  The plan of the event as proposed includes the use of sign(s), display(s), post(s), or placard(s), banner(s) which
                  exceed three feet by three feet in size, are made of a material other than paper, cardboard, poster board, or
                  foam, are attached or affixed to any wooden, plastic, metal, or other type of support, or are draped or affixed
                  to any Seminole County property, including, but limited to, the ground, trees, and buildings within Seminole
                  County.

                  For events that have been granted a permit or events that do not require a permit, the Seminole County Sheriff's
                  Office or the county commission shall have the authority to terminate an event at any time, or prevent its initiation,
                  should traffic, weather, or other conditions develop which present an imminent danger to those participating in the
                  event or to the public at large. If an event is permitted and is terminated pursuant to this subsection, the permit
                  shall be revoked for that day only.
                  If in preparation for or after the start of an event for which a permit has been issued, participants in said event
                  violate the terms of the permit or deviate in material fashion from the plan submitted in the application for the
                  permit, the Seminole County Sheriff's Office or the county commission shall have the authority to terminate the
                  event at any time or prevent its initiation. If an event is terminated pursuant to this subsection, the permit shall be

                  The public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the county require the orderly, harmonious and progressive
                  development of the area within the county, and in the interest of this goal the purpose and intent of this article is to:
                  Encourage the development of economically sound and stable communities;
                  Ensure the establishment of an economically maintainable network of roads in the county;
                  Ensure safe and convenient traffic, both vehicular and pedestrian, access to new land developments; and
                  Ensure harmony and compatibility between new roads and existing county roadways, state and federal
                  highways, and streets of the several municipalities.

                  portion of the county, except for through streets and roads that may be included in a major thoroughfare plan adopted by the
                  county commission, shall be built by the landowner or developer proposing such road and shall be located and built in the manner

                  required by section 42-63 constitutes no implied responsibility on the county for any assistance in construction, either in materials,
                  labor or equipment, these being entirely the responsibility of the developer. Specifically, the developer will move, at his cost, all

                  the county to pave or resurface the road at the time of construction or at a future date. Paving shall be done at the discretion of
                  the board of commissioners.

                  Sec. 42-63. - Final plan.
                  Four copies of a final plan containing the information required in an original proposal under this division, modified to include
                  the suggestions of the road superintendent and the county administrator, along with four copies of each required drainage
                  easement shall be submitted to the road superintendent. If, in the road suprintendent's opinion, the plan meets all of the
                  planimetric requirements of the regulations of this division, he shall, within three days, note such approval on all copies and apply
                  his initials. He shall then forward all copies to the county administrator. The county administrator shall, within three days, obtain

                  approval of the county commissioner, the county administrator shall within two days execute, initial and date each copy. He shall

                  the layout follows the approved plan, he shall so note that fact on the developer's copy of the approved plan and date the note. He
                  shall make the same notation on his copy of the approved plan. Upon such approval and upon compliance with section 42-65,
                  construction may begin.

                  developer may file with the county administrator a written, notarized commitment to maintain the roadbed, shoulders, ditches,
                  backslopes and drainage structures or in lieu thereof may post a bond, approved by the county attorney as to form, in an amount
                  stipulated by the county administrator. That amount shall be sufficient to reimburse the county for any costs that it might have to
                  assume to provide a road of the intended quality at the end of the one-year warranty period.

                  Sec. 42-91. - Alignment.
                  Collector roads are to be aligned so as to contribute to the circulatory network of the county. To achieve this objective, the
                  road superintendent may require that they be terminated so that future rights-of-way may continue on the same alignment into
                  other property. If land abutting a proposed or existing collector road in the vicinity of another proposed collector road is owned by
                  the applicant, then the board of commissioners may require that the road be constructed through the property to achieve an
                  intersection, provided the proposed land development for which a collector road is to be built is one-fourth mile or less from such
                  intersection. Minor residential roads are to be aligned so as to follow the contours of the existing terrain as much as possible while
                  simultaneously considering the best land utilization by the developer. At the city limits of incorporated places and in the urbanizing

                  No person shall divide or subdivide or cause a subdivision to be made, by deed or map, of any parcel of land which
                  is located within the boundaries of the unincorporated county, except in conformity with the provisions of this
                  chapter.
                  Any owner or developer of any tract of land situated within the county who subdivides such land shall cause a plat
                  of such subdivision, with reference to known or permanent monuments, to be made and recorded in the office of
                  the clerk of superior court of the county. No such plat of subdivision shall be recorded unless and until it shall have
                  been submitted to and approved and certified by the county planning commission and the board of commissioners.
                  The regulations of this chapter bear no relation to any private easement, covenant, agreement or restriction, and
                  the responsibility of enforcing such private easement, covenant, agreement or restriction is not implied herein to
                  any public official. When the regulations of this chapter call for more restrictive standards than those required by
                  private contract, the provisions of this chapter shall control.

                  Sec. 50-41. - Purpose.
                  The purpose of this article is to establish the procedure for county commission review and action on applications for proposed
                  subdivisions. The procedure is intended to provide orderly and expeditious processing of such applications. The documents to be
                  submitted are intended to provide the county with sufficient information and data to ensure compliance with all county codes and
                  specifications and ensure that the proposed development meets the design and improvement standards contained in this chapter.
                  Sec. 50-42. - Preapplication conference.
                  For the purpose of expediting subdivision applications and reducing subdivision design and development costs, the developer
                  may request a preapplication conference in accordance with the following requirements:
                  The preapplication conference shall allow the applicant to meet with appropriate county representatives.
                  These individuals may include the county engineer and county planner, among others.
                  The applicant shall not be bound by the determination of the preapplication conference, nor shall the county
                  commission be bound by any such review.
                  The purpose of the meeting is defeated if the technical staff does not have the preliminary plat far enough in
                  advance to study it.

                  Final approval shall expire within 90 days from the date of the signing of the plat by the county commission
                  chair and clerk of the county unless within such period the plat shall have been duly filed for recording by the

                  consideration.
                  Release of bond. The bond shall be released after an additional inspection by the county engineer indicates
                  that all paving, drainage and other improvements have proven satisfactory and have withstood the two-year
                  test period.

                  review will entail the filing of a single application and final plat to satisfy the requirements of this article.
                  Filing. The developer shall file with the county an application for one step final plat approval with all
                  specifications and data required for final plats under section 50-46(g). In the case of a single parcel, plat
                  requirements may be waived if the parcel can be adequately described without the use of a plat.
                  Application requirements. The application shall contain the following:
                  A letter of application containing the name and address of a person to whom notice may be sent.

                  provide adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; to
                  facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, and other public requirements by
                  dividing Seminole County into districts of such size and shape as may be best suited to carry out the purposes of the
                  legislative act and of this Ordinance.

                  Editor's note— Printed herein is the county's zoning ordinance, as adopted by the board of commissioners April 13, 2001.
                  Amendments to the ordinance are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history
                  note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original ordinance. Obvious misspellings and punctuation errors
                  have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines, capitalization, citation to

                  made for clarity are indicated by brackets.

                  facility. The impact of a BandB should not be much greater than that of a private home with frequent houseguests, with the

                  measured from the common property line and extends the developed portion of the common property line. A buffer consists of
                  trees, shrubs, and other natural vegetation undisturbed by grading or site development and replanted where sparsely vegetated or

                  person, animal or goods. Where roofed structures are separated from each other by party walls having no opening passage, each

                  Undue hardship. A condition which shall be considered to exist only when one or more of the following apply to a particular
                  piece of property and such condition has not been created by action of the property owner:
                  The owner cannot comply with the provisions of [these regulations] without violation of some other
                  [regulation] or sections of [these regulations].
                  The provisions of [these regulations] create for the property owner a peculiar condition not common to other

                  A conforming use or requirement is incongruous with the remainder of the area in which the property is

                  commission and approval by the Seminole County Board of Commissioners. Such deviation will not be contrary to the public
                  interest, and where owing to conditions unique to the individual property on which the variance is sought and not as a result of
                  any action on the part of the property owner, a literal enforcement of this Ordinance would result in unnecessary and undue
                  hardship; provided, however, that no variance will be granted which shall authorize a land use not otherwise permitted in a
                  particular district. (See article IV, section 4.21 for the criteria to be utilized in the review of variance requests.)

                  FH, Flood Hazard District.
                  Section 3.02. - Limited Use (L.U.) Provision.
                  The Seminole County Board of Commission established the "Limited Use" Provision for the purpose of allowing an applicant to
                  request that a certain area be designated as a limited use. In some areas of the county, a particular land use activity out of a
                  general zoning classification may have less community impact than some of the possibilities of uses in that specific classification.
                  For this reason, an applicant may request in his rezoning petition to limit the use of a proposed property to a specified use only
                  (i.e., C-1 L.U.). To wit: neighborhood business district limited to a "beauty shop". The limited use must be among the uses permitted
                  in the zone classification for which the limited use is taken.
                  Section 3.03. - District boundaries.
                  The boundaries of the above districts are shown on a set of maps designated "Official Zoning Maps, Seminole County,
                  Georgia." The Seminole County Tax Parcel Maps are the base maps for the county's zoning districts and all of these tax parcel
                  maps are hereby designated AG, agricultural zoning unless otherwise designated on said map.
                  Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the aforesaid districts as shown on the zoning maps, the
                  following rules shall apply:
                  Where zoning district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the centerlines of roads or
                  highways or railroad right-of-way lines extended, such centerlines or railroad right-of-way lines or such lines
                  extended shall be construed to be such boundaries.
                  Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the county line or the corporate limits line
                  of any incorporated place or the militia district line of any militia district or the land lot line of any land lot, such
                  county line, corporate limits line, militia district line or land lot shall be construed to be such boundaries.
                  Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately parallel to the centerlines of streets or highways,
                  such district boundaries, unless otherwise specifically indicated, shall be construed as being parallel thereto
                  and at a distance of 200 feet from the right-of-way line of such streets and highways, each above district
                  boundary being shown at scale on the official zoning map of Seminole County, Georgia.
                  Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the centerline of streambeds or riverbeds,
                  such centerlines or such lines extended shall be construed to be such boundaries.
                  Section 3.04. - District boundary lines dividing a lot of single ownership.
                  Where a district boundary line, as appearing on the zoning map, divides a lot in single ownership at the time of the enactment
                  of these regulations, the requirements for the district in which the greater portion of the lot lies shall be extended to the balance of
                  the lot; provided, that such extension will not include any part of such lot more than 35 feet beyond the district boundary line; and,
                  provided further, that this provision shall not apply to a through lot. In the case of a through lot, the restriction of the district
                  applying to the adjoining lots which front on the same street as the proposed use of the lot shall apply. A through lot being a lot
                  that runs from street to street.
                  ARTICLE IV. - GENERAL PROVISIONS
                  Except as hereinafter specifically provided, the following regulations shall apply.

                  are imposed or required by the provisions of any other law or ordinance, the provisions of this Ordinance shall govern.
                  Section 4.02. - Scope.
                  No building or structure, or part thereof, shall hereinafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed, or altered and maintained,
                  and no new use or change shall be made or maintained of any building, structure or land, or part thereof, except in conformity
                  with the provisions of this Ordinance (farm accessory buildings excluded).
                  Section 4.03. - Only one principal dwelling per lot.
                  Except as herein provided, there shall be no more than one principal dwelling per lot or parcel other than within a PUD
                  development. However, in AG zones within the unincorporated area of Seminole County, there shall be permitted as many as four
                  residential uses (farm-related dwellings) on any parcel of land under single ownership where the following conditions can be met:
                  The purpose for this special use is to support established farming operations located on the property being
                  requested.
                  Each such nonprincipal residential use shall occupy a land area not less than 40,000 square feet in size.
                  Each such land area shall be so defined by permanent physical markers as to be given a numerical address
                  and location designation.
                  Each such land area shall receive approval from the Seminole County health authorities as to its suitability as a
                  site for an effective sanitary sewage disposal system designed to accommodate wastes generated by the user
                  of that land site.
                  An acceptable domestic water supply shall be available to each satellite user of this special provision and such
                  water supply shall meet local public requirements as administered by the Seminole County health authorities.
                  Each such use shall be accessible either by private drive or public roadway to the public thoroughfare system.
                  Individual power supply sources shall be provided to each user under this special provision and each utility
                  installation shall meet such standards as have been adopted by local authorities.
                  Facilities established under this special provision for residential use shall meet the requirements of local
                  construction and use codes established by the Seminole County Commission.
                  Permits for construction will not be issued prior to the approval of each of the aforementioned condition by
                  the zoning administrator. In addition, any change in use or occupancy must be approved by the zoning
                  administrator.
                  Section 4.04. - Substandard lots.
                  Any residentially zoned lot which was of record at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance that does not meet the
                  requirements of this Ordinance for yards or other area or open space may be utilized for single residence purposes, provided the
                  area from such yard or court in width, depth, or open space is not less than 75 percent of that required by the terms of this
                  Ordinance. However, all substandard lots must have health department approval for placement of well and septic tanks. The
                  purpose is to permit utilization of recorded lots which lack adequate width or depth as long as reasonable living standards can be
                  provided.

                  Accessory buildings, except garages, shall be erected in any required yard except a front yard, providing
                  further that in no instance shall such a building be nearer than five feet to any adjoining side lot line or rear lot

                  In order to provide adequate protective screening for residential areas adjacent to or near nonresidential areas, the following
                  regulation shall apply:
                  Adjacent residential property. Where a manufacturing or commercial district abuts directly upon a residentially
                  zoned district, a landscaped greenbelt, not less than 20 feet wide, shall be provided and maintained along its entire
                  length by the users of these properties. These districts shall be screened from such contiguous residentially zoned
                  district. Such greenbelt shall be planted with deciduous trees, evergreens, flowering trees and/or ornamental trees
                  set not closer than six feet to the fence or wall.
                  The remainder of the landscaped area, which is not planted with the aforementioned stock, shall be in well-kept
                  lawn. All landscaping shall be maintained in a healthy growing condition.
                  All planting plans shall be first submitted to the planning commission for approval as to suitability of planting
                  materials and arrangement thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
                  If, in the opinion of the planning commission, the greenbelt would serve no good purpose, the commission may
                  waive such requirements.
                  Section 4.12. - Animals in residential districts.
                  It is the intent of this section to permit certain uses in residential zoning districts (R-1 and R-2) which involve the keeping of
                  limited numbers of domestic animals or pets where it is recognized that such areas are changing from agricultural to suburban
                  residential in character. This section is further intended to minimize problems which may arise from such animal uses and to
                  provide suitable standards for protection of health, safety, welfare and preservation of residential districts from indiscriminate
                  raising of animals.
                  Uses permitted:
                  Livestock. Horses, cows, ponies, donkeys, and other domestic livestock may be kept, raised or bred for
                  home use and enjoyment; provided, that only one such animal shall be permitted for each two acres of
                  land area and shall be adequately contained by fence within that property. The keeping of any swine is
                  specifically prohibited.
                  Domestic pets. Cats, dogs, rabbits, or other generally recognized domestic pets may be kept or bred by
                  persons residing on the property for their use and enjoyment.
                  Fowl. Ducks, quail, chickens, turkeys, pigeons, pheasants, etc., may be raised for home use, provided such
                  fowl are adequately contained (penned) within that property.
                  [Application to in-residence use.] These permitted use provisions for animals in residential districts are
                  meant to apply only outside of the residence on an individual lot and are not intended to restrict the type
                  or number of animals within a residence.
                  [Maintenance in relation to property line.] All animals will be maintained at least 25 feet from any
                  property line.

                  Section 4.13. - Recreational vehicles.
                  Recreational vehicles shall not be utilized as a permanent dwelling in any zoning district. Occupancy exceeding 30 days shall be
                  considered permanent.
                  Section 4.14. - Mobile homes.
                  Mobile homes which do not bear a[n] HUD insignia are prohibited. [This prohibition is] not applicable to existing mobile homes

                  Section 4.18. - Skirting.
                  All mobile homes must be properly skirted. (See section 8.05.)
                  Section 4.19. - Conditional uses.
                  [A] public hearing [is] required. Before a building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for a conditional use,
                  application shall be made to the planning commission which, after careful review of any applicable sections of this Ordinance, may
                  recommend to the county commission the issuance of such permit or approval if in the judgment of the planning commission it
                  will not be detrimental to the health, safety, and general welfare of Seminole County.
                  An application to establish a conditional use shall be approved following a review by the planning commission and a
                  determination by the Seminole County Board of Commissioners that:
                  The proposed use will not be contrary to the purpose of this Ordinance.
                  The proposed use will not be detrimental to the use or development of adjacent properties or the general
                  neighborhood nor affect adversely the health and safety of residents and workers.
                  The proposed use will not constitute a nuisance or hazard because of the number of persons who will attend
                  or use such facility, vehicular movement, noise or fumes generation, or type of physical activity.
                  The proposed use will not be affected adversely by the existing uses, and the proposed use will be placed on a
                  lot of sufficient size to satisfy the space requirements of said use.
                  The parking and all development standards set forth for each particular use for which a permit may be granted
                  have been met.

                  Section 4.20. - Telecommunication antennas and towers.
                  The purpose of this section is to establish standards and regulations for the siting of antennas and towers.
                  All siting of antennas and towers will be required to submit site plans to the county for approval.
                  Each applicant for an antenna and/or tower shall provide an inventory of its existing owner that are either
                  within the county or within one-quarter mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the
                  location, height, and design of each tower.
                  The following shall govern the location of all towers and the installation of all antennas. If, in the opinion of the
                  board of commissioners, these requirements would serve no good purpose, the board of commissioners may
                  waive such requirements:
                  Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA,
                  be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
                  At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use
                  materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural
                  setting and built environment.
                  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and
                  mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to or closely compatible with the color
                  of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as
                  possible.
                  Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting
                  is required, the governing authority may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design
                  that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views.
                  Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered
                  abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove same within 90 days of receipt of notice
                  from the governing authority notifying the owner of such abandonment. If such antenna or tower is not
                  removed within said 90 days, the governing authority may, in the manner provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-8—41-2-
                  17, remove such antenna or tower at the owner's expense. If there are two or more users of a single tower,
                  then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the tower.

                  Section 4.21. - Appeals and variances.
                  The Seminole County Board of Commissioners shall hear and decide appeals where there is alleged error in any
                  order, requirements, decision, or determination made by the zoning administrator in enforcement of this
                  Ordinance.

                  The board of commissioners may authorize in specific cases such hardship variances from the terms of this Ordinance
                  in its opinion be contrary to the public interest, where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisio
                  Ordinance will in an individual case result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of the Ordinance will be observed
                  safety and welfare secured. Such variance may be granted in such individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a find
                  board that:
                  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question
                  because of its size, shape or topography; and
                  The application of this Ordinance to th[at] particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship;
                  and
                  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and
                  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public interest or impair the purposes and
                  intent of this Ordinance; provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building
                  which use is prohibited by this Ordinance. The county will control the actual use of properties through zoning
                  and conditional uses and not through a grant of variance.
                  Variances will first be reviewed by the Seminole County Planning Commission and recommendation made to the
                  county commission. (Public hearing required).
                  Section 4.22. - Hardship manufactured homes/travel trailers.
                  The planning commission may recommend to the board of commissioners approval of a variance for the use of one hardship
                  manufactured home or travel trailer. The application for such a variance shall be for the use of one manufactured home or travel
                  trailer. The placement of one hardship manufactured home or travel trailer on an occupied residential lot may be allowed if it is
                  established that a genuine hardship exists only by reason of medical disability or age and the following variance criteria are met:
                  The subject occupant of the manufactured home or travel trailer is a relative by blood or marriage of the
                  owner of the property; and
                  Documentation of medical disability or age infirmity is required to be certified by a medical doctor's statement.
                  This certification will be valid for a one-year period. If an extension is needed after one year, a new application
                  for a hardship variance shall be submitted; and
                  Said manufactured home or travel trailer shall be removed from the premises within 60 days when the
                  specified disability ceases to exist; and
                  Under no circumstances shall the manufactured home or travel trailer be rented or otherwise occupied by
                  anyone other than the approved applicant nor shall it be used for storage or other similar uses; and
                  The Seminole County Health Department approves the temporary placement of a second dwelling on the
                  proposed property; and
                  The planning commission board of commissioners may impose reasonable requirements which would effect
                  the interests of the public health, safety and general welfare.
                  Section 4.23. - Rural business uses permitted, prohibited and development standards.
                  A rural business shall be secondary or incidental to the primary use of property for agricultural or residential purposes. Such
                  business shall be primarily directed toward providing local or neighborhood services to rural-residential areas. Rural business are
                  intended to be of smaller size, intensity and scale commercial uses that would be more commonly found in commercial zoning
                  districts. Rural businesses shall be similar to home occupations except that the activity can occur in an accessory structure
                  detached from the principal residence. In addition, an application for rural business must have established residency and be living
                  in residence upon the subject property prior to any application being filed for consideration by the planning commission.
