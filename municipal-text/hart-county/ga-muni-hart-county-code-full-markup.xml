         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a complete codification of the general and permanent ordinances of Hart County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances and resolutions adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Palmer Carr, Supervising Editor, and John Welch, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

                  The publisher is most grateful to Mr. David B. Brooks, County Administrator, and Mr. Walter J.

                  Be it Ordained by the Board of Commissioners of Hart County, Georgia: 
                  Section 1. The Code entitled "Code of Ordinances, Hart County, Georgia," published by Municipal Code Corporation, consisting of chapters 1 through 82, each inclusive, is adopted. 
                  Section 2. All ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted on or before October 27, 1998, and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein, are repealed. 
                  Section 3. The repeal provided for in section 2 hereof shall not be construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance that is repealed by this ordinance.

Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any Code section, whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the county may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief and revocation of licenses or permits. 
                  Section 5. Additions or amendments to the Code when passed in the form as to indicate the intention of the board of commissioners to make the same a part of the Code shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments.

                  (c)  For purposes of this section: 
                  (1)  The terms "tract," "block," and "VTD" shall mean and describe the same geographical boundaries as provided in the report of the Bureau of the Census for the United States decennial census of 1990 for the State of Georgia; 
                  (2)  The term "precinct" is synonymous with the term "voting precinct" and means a geographical area designated by O.C.G.A. tit. 21, ch. 2, art. 7 or ch. 3, within which all electors vote at one polling place; 
                  (3)  Precinct names and designations following VTD designations are included for convenience only; and in the event the description of any commissioner district contains a conflict between the geographical boundaries of any VTD and the boundaries of the following named precinct, the geographical boundary of the VTD as shown on the census maps for the United States decennial census of 1990 for the State of Georgia shall control;

Crittendon, et al. (U.S. District Court Case No. 88-56-ATH (DF)), and given that the present five commissioners have all been elected for full four-year terms as prescribed by said consent order, there is no need for a special election.

                  Section 7. - Revenue bonds; form, denomination; registration; place of payment. 
                  The authority shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest thereon, which may be at any bank or trust company inside or outside the state. The bonds may be issued in coupon or registered form, or both, as the authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bond as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest. 
                  Section 8. - Revenue bonds; signatures; seal. 
                  In case any officer whose signature shall appear on any bonds or whose facsimile signature shall appear on any coupon shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if such officer had remained in office until such delivery. All such bonds shall be signed by the chairperson of the authority and the official seal of the authority shall be affixed thereto and attested by the secretary of the authority and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signatures of the chairperson and the secretary of the authority. Any coupon may bear the facsimile signatures of such persons and any bond may be signed, sealed, and attested on behalf of the authority by such persons as at the actual time of the execution of such bonds shall be duly authorized or hold the proper office, although at the date of such bonds such person may not have been so authorized or shall not have held such office. 
                  Section 9. - Revenue bonds; negotiability; exemption from taxation. 
                  All revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall have and are declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the laws of this state. Such bonds, their transfer, and the income therefrom shall be exempt from all taxation within this state. 
                  Section 10. - Revenue bonds; sale; price; proceeds. 
                  The authority may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interest of the authority. The proceeds derived from the sale of such bonds shall be used solely for the purpose or purposes provided in the resolutions and proceedings authorizing the issuance of such bonds. 
                  Section 11. - Revenue bonds; interim receipts and certificates or temporary bonds. 
                  Prior to the preparation of any definitive bonds, the authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts, interim certificates, or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter. 
                  Section 12. - Revenue bonds; replacement of lost or mutilated bonds. 
                  The authority may provide for the replacement of any bonds or coupons which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost. 
                  Section 13. - Revenue bonds; conditions precedent to issuance. 
                  Such revenue bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things other than those proceedings, conditions, and things which are specified or required by this act. In the discretion of the authority, revenue bonds of a single issue may be issued for the purpose of any particular project. Any resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this act shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special meeting of the authority by a majority of its members. 
                  Section 14. - Credit not pledged. 
                  Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of Franklin County or Hart County nor a pledge of the faith and credit of said counties; but such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund hereinafter provided for and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate said counties to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment. All such bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this section. 
                  Section 15. - Trust indenture as security. 
                  In the discretion of the authority, any issuance of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company inside or outside the state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues, and earnings to be received by the authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair, and insuring of the project, and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor, and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the secu rity of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the project affected by such indenture. 
                  Section 16. - To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid. 
                  In the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, the authority shall provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who, or any agency, bank, or trust company which, shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes of this act, subject to such regulations as this act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide. 
                  Section 17. - Sinking fund. 
                  The revenues, fees, tolls, and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such fees, earnings, and revenues were produced by a particular project for which bonds have been issued, unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the authority to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds of the authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or the trust instrument may provide. Such funds so pledged from whatever source received, including funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture into a sinking fund which shall be pledged to and charged with the payment of: 
                  (1)  The interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due; 
                  (2)  The principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due; 
                  (3)  The necessary charges of paying agents for paying principal and interest and other investment charges; 
                  (4)  Any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as provided in this act; and 
                  (5)  Any investment fees or charges. 
                  The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be maintained as a trust account for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or the trust indenture, any surplus moneys in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds, and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be canceled and shall not again be issued. 
                  Section 18. - Remedies of bondholders. 
                  Any holder of revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act or any of the coupons appertaining thereto and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights given in this act may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of this state or granted under this act or under such resolution or trust indenture and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this act or by such resolution or trust indenture to be performed by the authority or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished. 
                  Section 19. - Refunding bonds. 
                  The authority is authorized to provide by resolution for the issuance of bonds of the authority for the purpose of funding or refunding any revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act and then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and premium, if any. The issuance of such funding or refunding bonds, the maturities and all other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof, and the duties of the authority in respect to the same shall be governed by the foregoing provisions of this act insofar as the same may be applicable. 
                  Section 20. - Validation. 
                  Bonds of the authority shall be confirmed and validated in accordance with the procedure of O.C.G.A. § 36-82-60 et seq., known as the "Revenue Bond Law." The petition for validation shall also make party defendant to such action the State of Georgia or any municipality, county, authority, political subdivision, or instrumentality of the State of Georgia which has contracted with the authority for the services and facilities of the project for which bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated, and the state or such municipality, county, authority, political subdivision, or instrumentality shall be required to show cause, if any exists, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the court and the contract or contracts adjudicated as a part of the basis for the security for the payment of any such bonds of the authority. The bonds, when validated, and the judgement of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds, and the security for the payment thereof and interest thereon and against the authority issuing the same and the state and any municipality, county, authority, political subdivision, or instrumentality, if a party to the validation proceedings, contracting with the Franklin-Hart Airport Authority. 
                  Section 21. - Venue and jurisdiction. 
                  Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this act or any suit or action against such authority shall be brought in the superior court of Franklin County, Georgia; and any action pertaining to validation of any bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall likewise be brought in said court which shall have exclusive, original jurisdiction of such actions. 
                  Section 22. - Interest of bondholders protected. 
                  While any of the bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties, or existence of said authority or its officers, employees, or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of such bonds. No other entity, department, agency, or authority will be created which will compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds, nor will the state itself so compete with the authority. The provisions of this act shall be for the benefit of the authority and the holders of any such bonds, and, upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions hereof, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds. 
                  Section 23. - Moneys received considered trust funds. 
                  All moneys received pursuant to the authority of this act, whether as proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds, as grants or other contributions, or as revenue, income, fees, and earnings, shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided in this act. 
                  Section 24. - Purpose of the authority. 
                  Without limiting the generality of any provision of this act, the general purpose of the authority is declared to be that of acquiring, constructing, equipping, maintaining, and operating an airport and the usual facilities related thereto, and improving of such facilities, acquiring parking facilities and parking areas in connection therewith, acquiring the necessary property therefor, both real and personal, and leasing or selling any or all of such facilities, including real property, and doing any and all things deemed by the authority to be necessary, convenient, or desirable for and incident to the efficient and proper development and operation of such types of undertaking.

                  It is found, determined, and declared that the creation of the authority and the carrying out of its corporate purpose is in all respects for the benefit of the people of this state and that the authority is an institution of purely public charity and will be performing an essential governmental function in the exercise of the power conferred upon it by this act, and this state covenants with the holders of the bonds that the authority shall not be required to pay any taxes or assessments upon any of the property acquired or leased by it or under its jurisdiction, control, possession, or supervision or upon its activities in the operation or maintenance of the projects erected by it or any rates, fees, tolls, or other charges for the use of such projects or other income received by the authority, and that the bonds of the authority, their transfer, and the income therefrom shall at all times be exempt from taxation within this state.

                  (6)  No building acquired under this Act shall be operated by the authority but shall be leased or sold to one or more persons, firms, or corporations. If sold, the purchase price may be paid at one time or in installments falling due in not more than 30 years from the date of transfer of possession. The lessee or purchaser shall be required to pay all costs of operating and maintaining the building or buildings and to pay rentals or installments sufficient, together with other revenues which may be pledged for the purpose, to retire all bonds, both principal and interest, and to pay all other expenses which the authority may have incurred in connection with the undertaking; 
                  (7)  To accumulate its funds from year to year and to invest accumulated funds in any manner that public funds of the State of Georgia or any of its political subdivisions may be invested;

                  In order to finance any undertaking within the scope of its power or to refund any bonds then outstanding, the authority is authorized to issue bonds bearing such rate or rates of interest and maturing at the years and amounts determined by the authority, and the procedure of validation, issuance, and delivery shall be in all respects in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 36-82-60 et seq., the "Revenue Bond Law," as if said obligations had been originally authorized to be issued thereunder; provided, however, that any property, real or personal, of the authority may be pledged, mortgaged, conveyed, assigned, hypothecated, or otherwise encumbered as security for any lawful debt of the authority. The authority may execute any trust agreement or indenture not in conflict with the provisions of this act to provide security for any bonds issued as provided in this act, and such trust agreement or indenture may provide for foreclosure or forced sale of any property of the authority upon default on such bonds either in payment of principal or interest or under any term or condition under which such bonds are issued. Nothing contained in this act shall be construed to create a right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of Hart County to pay any such bonds or the interest thereon nor to enforce payment thereof against any property of Hart County. 
                  Section 7. - Issuance of bonds for extensions, improvements.

                  Section 8. - Loans. 
                  In addition to the powers provided in other sections of this act, the authority is authorized to do any or all of the following:

The term "facility" as used in this paragraph means and includes any type of real or personal property or a combination thereof which is intended to be used in connection with the operation of an industrial or manufacturing plant or a commercial enterprise located in Hart County. Such loans or the extension of any such credit shall be secured by such terms and conditions as the authority shall determine to be reasonable;

                  Section 10. - Form of revenue bonds.

                  Section 11. - Certificate of validation of revenue bonds.

                  Section 12. - Resolution regarding bonds. 
                  No bonds except refunding bonds shall be issued by the authority unless its governing body shall adopt a resolution finding that the undertaking for which such bonds are to be issued will promote the objectives of the authority and will tend to increase, or to prevent a decrease in, employment opportunities in Hart County. 
                  Section 13. - Purpose for issuance of revenue bonds.

                  Section 6. - Same; form; denomination; registration; place of payment. 
                  The authority shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest thereon, which may be at any bank or trust company inside or outside this state. The bonds may be issued in coupon or registered form, or both, as the authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bond as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest. 
                  Section 7. - Same; signatures; seal. 
                  In case any officer whose signature shall appear on any bonds or whose facsimile signature shall appear on any coupon shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if such officer had remained in office until such delivery. All such bonds shall be signed by the chairman of the authority and the official seal of the authority shall be affixed thereto and attested by the secretary of the authority and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signatures of the chairman and secretary of the authority. Any coupon may bear the facsimile signatures of such persons and any bond may be signed, sealed and attested on behalf of the authority by such persons as at the actual time of the execution of such bonds shall be duly authorized or hold the proper office, although at the date of such bonds such person may not have been so authorized or shall not have held such office. 
                  Section 8. - Same; negotiability; exemption from taxation. 
                  All revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall have and are declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the laws of this state. Such bonds, their transfer and the income therefrom shall be exempt from all taxation within the state. 
                  Section 9. - Same; sale; price; proceeds.

                  Section 10. - Same; interim receipts and certificates or temporary bonds. 
                  Prior to the preparation of any definitive bonds, the authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts, interim certificates or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds under the issuance of the latter. 
                  Section 11. - Same; replacement of lost or mutilated bonds. 
                  The authority may provide for the replacement of any bonds or coupons which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost.

In the discretion of the authority, revenue bonds of a single issue may be issued for the purpose of any particular project. Any resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this act shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special or adjourned meeting of the authority by a majority of its members. 
                  Section 13. - Credit not pledged. 
                  Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of Hart County nor a pledge of the faith and credit of said county, but such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund provided for by this act and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly or contingently obligate said county to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment, and all such bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this section. 
                  Section 14. - Trust indenture as security. 
                  In the discretion of the authority, any issuance of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company inside or outside the state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues and earnings to be received by the authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for the protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bond holders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair and insuring of the project, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor, and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the s ecurity of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project affected by such indenture. 
                  Section 15. - To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid. 
                  In the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, the authority shall provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who, or any agency, bank or trust company which, shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as this act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide. 
                  Section 16. - Sinking fund. 
                  The revenues, fees, tolls and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such fees, earnings and revenues were produced by a particular project for which bonds have been issued unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the authority to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds of the authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust instrument may provide, and such funds so pledged from whatever source received, which said pledge may include funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture, into a sinking fund, which said sinking fund shall be pledged to and charged with the payment of: 
                  (1)  The interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due; 
                  (2)  The principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due; 
                  (3)  The necessary charges of paying agent for paying principal and interest and other investment charges; and 
                  (4)  Any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as provided in this act. 
                  The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be maintained as a trust account for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture any surplus moneys in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be canceled and shall not again be issued. 
                  Section 17. - Remedies of bondholders. 
                  Any holder of revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights given in this act may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Georgia or granted under this act or under such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this act or by such resolution or trust indenture to be performed by the authority or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished.

The issuance of such funding or refunding bonds, the maturities and all other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof, and the duties of the authority in respect to the same, shall be governed by the other provisions of this act insofar as the same may be applicable. 
                  Section 19. - Validation. 
                  Bonds of the authority shall be confirmed and validated in accordance with the procedure of O.C.G.A. tit. 36, ch. 82, art. 3, the "Revenue Bond Law," as amended [O.C.G.A. § 36-82-60 et seq.]. The petition for validation shall also make party defendant to such action the State of Georgia or any municipality, county, authority, political subdivision or instrumentality of the State of Georgia which has contracted with the authority for the services and facilities of the project for which bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated and the state or such municipality, county, authority, political subdivision or instrumentality shall be required to show cause, if any exists, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the court and the contract or contracts adjudicated as a part of the basis for the security for the payment of any such bonds of the authority. The bonds when validated, and the judgement of validation, shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds and the security for the payment thereof and interest thereon and against the authority issuing the same, and the state and any municipality, county, authority, political subdivision or instrumentality if a party to the validation proceedings, contracting with the said Hart County Water and Sewer Utility Authority.

The provisions of this act shall be for the benefit of the authority and the holders of any such bonds, and upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions of this act shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds. 
                  Section 22. - Moneys received considered trust funds. 
                  All moneys received pursuant to the authority of this act, whether as proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds, as grants or other contributions, or as revenue, income, fees and earnings, shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided in this act.

                  Sec. 2-2. - Process for resolving land annexation disputes. 
                  (a)  Prior to initiating any formal annexation activities 1 , the city will notify the county government of a proposed annexation and provide information on location of property, size of area, and proposed land use or zoning classifications(s) (if applicable) of the property upon annexation. [] 
                  Within 15 working days following receipt of the above information, the county will forward to the city a statement either: (a) indicating that the county has no objection to the proposed land use for the property; or (b) describing its bona fine objection(s) to the city's proposed land use classification, providing supporting information, and listing any possible stipulations or conditions that would alleviate the county's objection(s). 
                  (b)  If the county has no objection to the city's proposed land use or zoning classification, the city is free to proceed with the annexation. If the county fails to respond to the city's notice in writing within the deadline, the city is free to proceed with the annexation and the county loses its right to invoke the dispute resolution process, stop the annexation or object to land use changes after the annexation. 
                  (c)  If the county notifies the city that it has a bona fide land use classification objection(s) 2 , the city will respond to the county in writing within 15 working days of receiving the county's objection(s) by either: (a) agreeing to implement the county's stipulations and conditions and thereby resolving the county's objection(s); (b) agreeing with the county and stopping action on the proposed annexation; (c) disagreeing that the county's objection(s) are bona fide and notifying the county that the city will seek a declaratory judgment in court; or (d) initiating a 30-day (maximum) mediation process to discuss possible compromises. 3 [] 
                  (d)  If the city or county initiates mediation, the city and county will each appoint two members to a mediation panel. These four individuals will then select a fifth panel member who is familiar or experienced in land use issues. The Georgia Mountains RDC will provide a list of mediators to the city and county for their selection of a mediator to assist in the process. Any costs associated with the mediation will be shared on a 50/50 basis between the city and the county. 
                  (e)  If no resolution of the county's bona fide land use classification objection(s) results from the mediation, the city will not proceed with the proposed annexation. 
                  (f)  If the city and county reach agreement as described in step 3(a) or as a result of the mediation, they will draft an annexation agreement for execution by the city and county governments and the property owner(s) within 15 working days from the date of the agreement. 
                  Regardless of future changes in land use or zoning classification, any site-specific mitigation or enhancement measures or site-design stipulations included in the agreement will be binding on the property. The property owner(s) shall sign, notarize and return the agreement to the city. The agreement shall become final when signed by the city and the county and shall be filed at the courthouse. 
                  This annexation dispute resolution agreement shall remain in force and effect until amended by agreement of each party or unless otherwise terminated by operation of law.

                  (4)  After two readings the proposed ordinance, at the discretion of the board of commissioners, may be adopted or rejected at a subsequent regularly scheduled meeting, or it may be tabled pursuant to the ordinance to provide parliamentary procedures of the county board of commissioners, as adopted on February 27, 1996. 
                  (5)  After adoption of ordinances, the county clerk shall number ordinances consecutively, in the order of their final adoption, and shall copy them into a permanent record book used solely for this purpose; and shall do likewise for resolutions, using a separate series of numbers and a separate book. The original copy of all ordinances, resolutions and motions shall be filed and presented by the county clerk in the official minutes of the board of commissioners.

                  Sec. 6-86. - Purpose and findings. 
                  Having engaged in a factual investigation with respect to live human nudity and the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages, the board of commissioners finds that: 
                  (1)  The experiences of metropolitan areas, including but not limited to the cities of Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Los Angeles, California, demonstrate that the notorious conditions attaching to the commercial exploitation of live human nudity do not vary greatly by geographic location. 
                  (2)  Live public human nudity (either partial or total), particularly in conjunction with the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages tends to beget criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. 
                  (3)  Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with commercial live human nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution and other sex offenses, and drug offenses. 
                  (4)  Among the undesirable community conditions identified with commercial live human nudity and alcohol are: 
                  a.  Depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood; 
                  b.  Increased expenditures for the allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order; 
                  c.  Increased burdens on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior; 
                  d.  A decrease in the desirability of such areas for residential use; and 
                  e.  Acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. 
                  (5)  Evidence drawn from personal experience of county law enforcement officers indicates similar types of criminal behavior associated with these establishments, which is of concern to the governing authority. 
                  (6)  The concern for prevention of community blight is particularly significant for the county given its emphasis on economic and industrial development of areas for high-quality commercial and industrial uses. 
                  (7)  It is in the best interest of the public health, safety and welfare to reduce the adverse impacts of live commercial human nudity associated with the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages by addressing these concerns in this Code.

                  Sec. 10-31. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses, including but not limited to adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such business will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition. Otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult dance establishments, this section represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.

                  (16)  Land disturbing activities shall not be conducted within 100 horizontal feet, as measured from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, of the banks of any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of the Georgia Water Quality Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq., unless a variance for such activity is granted by the director except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in this article shall prevent an issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances or resolutions that contain requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. of 8-22-1995, § IV) 
                  Sec. 34-34. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  Generally. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall review the general development plans and detailed plans of the issuing authority that affect the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall review the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and other ordinances that regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the issuing authority. However, the property owner is the only party that can obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the county without first obtaining a permit from the board of commissioners to perform such activity. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the board of commissioners and must include the applicant's erosion and sedimentation control plan with supporting data, as necessary. These plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Soil erosion and sedimentation control plans shall conform to the provisions of section 34-33(b) and (c). Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's soil erosion and sedimentation control plans. 
                  (3)  A fee, in the amount specified in the schedule of fees and charges shall be charged for each acre or fraction of an acre in the project area. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 34-33(c)(15) and (16) and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(5)b. of this section, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. 
                  (5)  a.  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the erosion and sedimentation act, O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq., as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  b.  The issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination up to but not exceeding $3,000.00 per acre or fraction of an acre of the proposed land disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this article or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the issuing authority may call the bond or any part of the bond to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 34-33(b) and (c).

                  (b)  Stop work orders. Upon notice from the issuing authority or its agent, work on any project that is being done contrary to the provisions of this article or in a dangerous or unsafe manner shall be immediately stopped. Such notice shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner of the property, his authorized agent or the person in charge of the activity on the property, and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed. Where an emergency exists, no written notice shall be required. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture. If through inspection it is determined that a person engaged in land disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 34-34(b)(5)b. The issuing authority may call the bond or any part of the bond to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. Any person violating any provisions of this article, permitting conditions, or stop work order shall be liable for a monetary penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day, by a sentence of imprisonment not exceeding 60 days in jail, or both fine and jail or work alternative. Each day during which the violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall constitute a separate violation.

                  Sec. 38-31. - Authorization. 
                  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the board of commissioners of Hart County, Georgia, does ordain as follows in this article. 
                  (Ord. of 9-9-03, art. 1, § A) 
                  Sec. 38-32. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation which produces the potential for loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. of 9-9-03, art. 1, § B) 
                  Sec. 38-33. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  (Ord. of 9-9-03, art. 1, § C) 
                  Sec. 38-34. - Objectives. 
                  The objectives of this article are to: 
                  (1)  Protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  Insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a building, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of the building should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article.

                  Sec. 38-44. - Variance procedures. 
                  (a)  The county board of commissioners shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the public works director in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the county board of commissioners may appeal such decision to the superior court of the county, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the county board of commissioners shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances. 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The public works director shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.

All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components, all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces; 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters; 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 38-81(4), "elevated buildings". 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1—30, AE, or AH zones, may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 38-47(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Reference section 38-81(6) above.) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions), or 
                  2.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections (3)a.[—]c., above. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 38-37, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection a. above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division 2. 
                  (Ord. of 9-9-03, art. 4, § B) 
                  Sec. 38-83. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 38-37, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 38-37, then the public works director shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this division 2. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (subsections (2) and (3)) shall apply. 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 38-81(4), "elevated buildings". 
                  The public works director shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (Ord. of 9-9-03, art. 4, § C) 
                  Sec. 38-84. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). 
                  Areas of special flood hazard established in section 38-37, may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 38-81(4), "elevated buildings". 
                  The public works director shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in sections 38-46(1)c. and (2). 
                  (3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure. 
                  (Ord. of 9-9-03, art. 4, § D) 
                  Sec. 38-85. - Standards for subdivisions. 
                  (a)  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
                  (b)  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
                  (c)  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and 
                  (d)  Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less.

                  (a)  Where features of any comprehensive plan, such as school sites, parks, playgrounds and other public spaces are located in whole or in part in a proposed subdivision, such features shall be reserved by the subdivider; however, no more than 25 percent of the total area of the subdivision shall be required for reservation to fulfill the requirements of this section. Whenever the land required for such comprehensive plan features is not dedicated to and accepted, purchased, acquired, optioned or condemned by the appropriate public agency within a four-year period from the date of recording the subdivision or by the time that at least 75 percent of the lots are built on and occupied, whichever is sooner, the subdivider may claim the original reservation and cause it to be subdivided in a manner suitable to the subdivider, subject to the provisions of this chapter. Whenever the board executes a written release, stating that the reserved land is not to be acquired, the board shall waive the reservations requirements. 
                  (b)  Whenever the board finds that proposed reservation of land or dedication of land for public use is not required or is unsuitable for the public use proposed, it may require the rearrangement of lots to include such land in the subdivision.

                  Proposed streets that are obviously in alignment with others already existing and named shall bear the names of existing streets. In no case shall the name for proposed streets duplicate existing street names, irrespective of the use of the suffix, "street," "avenue," "boulevard," "drive," "place," "way" or "court." Where available, through its index list of street names on file, the board can assist the subdivider in avoiding duplication.

                  (a)  Width. The right-of-way width shall be the distance across a road or street from property line to property line. The minimum right-of-way width shall be 60 feet. 
                  (b)  Grade. A minimum of roadway to be graded shall be 30 feet for 20 feet of pavement. All stumps, rock and other obstructions shall be removed to at least two feet below subgrade. The maximum grade shall not exceed ten percent. Roads to be paved following grading shall be paved with a minimum of two inches of "B" mix. After development activity is complete, or 12 months have elapsed, a minimum of 1½ inches of "E" mix shall be laid. Roads to be paved after development is complete, or twelve months have elapsed, shall be paved with 1½ inches of "E" mix. New subdivision roads leading from existing public or county dirt roads shall meet all standards. All paving shall be in accordance with state department of transportation standards. 
                  (c)  Fill. All suitable material from roadway cuts may be used in the construction of fills, approaches or any other places as needed. The fills shall be spread in layers not to exceed six inches loose and compacted with a sheeps foot roller to a density at least 95 percent of standard proctor density. Fill slopes shall not exceed a two to one slope. 
                  (d)  Subgrade. The subgrade shall be properly shaped, ditch lines sloped and compacted to conform with grade lines and cross sections and shall have a crown of ½ inch per foot. All unsuitable materials shall be excavated and replaced with suitable material compacted to a density at least 95 percent of standard proctor density. Standard proctor density is determined by a laboratory test where a sample of soil is taken from a given site to test for compaction by measuring the dry unit density versus moisture content. 
                  (e)  Base. The base shall be a graded aggregate base course or other approved material. The minimum thickness shall be six inches after being compacted to a density at least 98 percent of standard proctor density. 
                  (f)  Storm drainage. The street and roadway must have adequate drainage, including necessary open ditches, pipe and culverts; drainage structures shall be provided to accommodate all natural water flow and to be of sufficient length to permit full roadway width and slopes. The diameter of pipe shall be based on water flow, and shall be determined by consultation with a registered professional engineer and approved by the public works director. 
                  (g)  Erosion control. All banks, shoulders, ditch slopes and other disturbed areas shall be grassed with an approved vegetative cover to prevent washing. Silt fences, hay bales, mulch and/or other erosion control devices that may be necessary shall be used during construction at all places that pose an erosion problem. All applicable provisions of soil erosion and sedimentation control as referenced in chapter 34 shall be complied with. 
                  (h)  Underground utilities. All underground utilities shall be installed after the grading has been completed but before the base is installed. Location of all utilities shall be shown on subdivision drawings. 
                  (i)  Intersections with state highways. Intersections with state highways must meet all regulations and standards promulgated by the state department of transportation for such intersections. 
                  (j)  Inspection. Roadways are to be inspected during and after construction by the public works director. Test reports of compaction results are to be furnished to the inspector; however, he may require additional testing in areas he may deem unsatisfactory. The board will not accept a street without approval of the inspector.

                  Final approval of street improvements shall be granted and streets accepted for maintenance by the county only in accordance with one of the following provisions: 
                  (1)  The street improvements shall have been completed and in place for a period of one year and shall, upon inspection, following such period of time, be found to be free from defective workmanship or material, free from sinkholes or other settling, and have a satisfactory vegetative cover. 
                  (2)  Following otherwise satisfactory completion of such work, the subdivider shall post with the county a guaranty bond in an amount equal to 25 percent of the street and utility improvement cost for the street for which acceptance is sought. The bond will guarantee the county that the street has been installed in a workmanlike manner, that it is free from defects caused by faulty material or workmanship, and that the street will remain in acceptable condition for a period of at least one year. The board may also authorize cash bonds of 25 percent of the street and utility cost in lieu of guaranty bonds. If at the end of the one-year period the street is found to have settled or be otherwise unacceptable because of faulty workmanship or materials, any defects shall be repaired at the cost of the subdivider; and upon his failure or refusal to do so within 90 days after demand is made upon him by the board, the county shall make such repairs as are reasonably necessary and recover the cost from the subdivider.

                  Sec. 46-228. - Water supply system. 
                  (a)  Water mains within the subdivision must be provided with tap connections to each lot. An exception is if the subdivision will be served by a municipal water system and the municipal water system agrees in writing that it will bore under the pavement to make any future connections. When water service is provided by the City of Hartwell, the minimum diameter of water pipes shall meet its standards. If a municipal water supply, either from a municipality or the county, is not available to the subdivision at the time of development of the subdivision, the developer should provide an adequate water source and an adequate water storage facility. This shall be accomplished by the use of individual wells for each housing unit or by an EPD approved public water system, or by a non-public water system, all meeting requirements of section 46-117. 
                  (b)  Individual wells' adequacy of water flow and water quality are the responsibility of the lot purchaser; however, a public water system shall be permitted and approved by the Environmental Protection Division of the Department of Natural Resources (EPD). Prior to final approval of the plat the developer must submit a letter from EPD approving plans to construct a public water system and the source of the water supply. 
                  (c)  In the absence of a municipal water supply, public or non-public water system, all lots within the subdivision shall be of sufficient size (taking into account slope and other relevant factors) to accommodate both an individual well and an approved septic system per Department of Human Resources Public Health chapter 290-5-26. 
                  (d)  A subdivision, whose entrance is within 1000 feet of a municipal water system, or where it is feasible to access a municipal water system via easement, etc and the distance to the municipal water system is within 1,000 feet, the developer shall connect the subdivision water system, at his expense, to the municipal water system with appropriate size water mains and dedicate the subdivision water system infrastructure to the municipality.

                  Sec. 46-232. - Extraterritorial water and sewer services. 
                  (a)  Prior to initiating the development of water and sewer services in extraterritorial boundaries, the local government proposing the new service will notify the adjacent government of the proposed new service by providing information on location of property, size of area, and existing proposed land use associated with the property. 
                  (b)  Within 15 working days following receipt of the above information, the local government receiving the notice of water/sewer extension will forward to the local government proposing the extension a statement either: (a) indicating that the proposal is compatible with that community's land use plan and all applicable ordinances; or (b) describing its bona fide objectives as why the proposal is inconsistent with the land use plan or ordinances providing supporting evidence and listing any possible stipulations or condition that alleviate the objection. 
                  (c)  If the community proposing the service extension does not receive a response in writing within the deadline, the proposal shall be determined to be consistent with the community's land use plan or land use ordinances and the sending local government is free to proceed and the receiving government loses its right to invoke the dispute resolution process, stop the extension or object to land use changes after the provision of service. 
                  (d)  If the receiving government notifies the sending government that it has a bona fide land use classification objection(s), the sending government will respond to the receiving government in writing within 15 working days of receiving the objection(s) by either: (a) agreeing to implement the receiving government stipulations and conditions and thereby resolving the extension objection(s); (b) agreeing with the receiving government and stopping action on the proposed extension; (c) disagreeing that the receiving government objection(s) are bona fide and notifying the receiving government that they will seek a declaratory judgment in court; or (d) initiating a 30-day (maximum) mediation process to discuss possible compromises. 
                  (e)  If either party initiates mediation, they will each appoint two members to a mediation panel. These four individuals will then select a fifth panel member who is familiar or experienced in land use issues. The Georgia Mountains RDC will provide a list of mediators to the city and county for their selection of a mediator to assist in the process. Any costs associated with the mediation will be shared on a 50/50 basis between the city and the county. 
                  (f)  If no resolution of the receiving government's bona fide land use classification objection(s) results from the mediation, the sending government will not proceed with the proposed extension of services. 
                  (g)  If the parties reach agreement as described in step (d) or as a result of the mediation, they will draft an agreement for execution by the governments within 15 working days from the date of the agreement. 
                  Regardless of future changes in land use or zoning classification, any site-specific mitigation or enhancement measures or site-design stipulations included in the agreement will be binding on the property. The agreement shall become final when signed by the city, the county and property owner(s) and be filed at the courthouse. 
                  This extraterritorial water and sewer services dispute resolution shall remain in force and effect until amended by agreement of each part or unless otherwise terminated by operation of law.

                  (1)  The use of unusual materials in constructing required improvements; or 
                  (2)  A new or untried design concept in the area which appears promising. 
                  (b)  Special attention may be given to experimental subdivisions that are related to low-cost housing design in an effort to provide housing for lower income families. The board shall require the subdivider to provide a written proposal stating the nature of the experiment, and cost-benefit study following the implementation of same. 
                  (c)  If a subdivision is approved as an experimental subdivision by the board, this designation shall be noted on the plat and reference to this section made along with reference to those requirements and their section number(s) that are being waived, varied or modified.

                  (a)  Disturbing the peace. It shall be unlawful to cause, incite, provoke or engage in any fight, brawl or riotous conduct so as to endanger the life, limb, health or property of another, or to disturb the peace and tranquility of any citizen or the public generally, and shall include the use of profane, indecent or obscene language in the presence of another.

It shall be unlawful for any person to be in an intoxicated condition in any public place or within the curtilage of any private residence not his own other than by invitation of the owner or lawful occupant, which condition is made manifest by boisterousness, by indecent condition or act, or by vulgar, profane, loud or unbecoming language. 
                  (d)  Loitering. It shall be unlawful to loiter in a public place. Among the circumstances that may be considered in determining whether alarm for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon the appearance of a law enforcement officer, refuses to identify himself, or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or any object. Unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or immediate concern that would otherwise be warranted by requesting the person to identify himself and explain his presence and conduct.

                  Sec. 62-31. - Findings. 
                  (a)  The Hart County and Town of Bowersville Comprehensive Plan has been prepared, which includes information on population, housing, economic development, natural and historic resources, existing and future land use, community facilities and services, and plan implementation; and this plan has been approved by the Georgia Mountains Regional Development Center and the state department of community affairs as having met the minimum planning standards of the 1989 Georgia Planning Act as set forth in O.C.G.A. § 36-70-1 et seq. 
                  (b)  The compelling logic behind the comprehensive plan is that it is wise for the community to look ahead, to anticipate problems and opportunities rather than simply react, to seek coordination among various activities rather than competition, and to make decisions based on shared community objectives. 
                  (c)  The comprehensive plan contains numerous statements of goals, policies and objectives, which serve as a guide to decision making and indicate how the board of commissioners is likely to act in certain instances and for what reasons. 
                  (d)  The comprehensive plan is the product of a planning process that should continue to evolve, because no single document can pose solutions to all community problems and periodic updates should take place based on changing conditions, the shifting of resources and the reassessment of goals, policies and objectives. 
                  (e)  The comprehensive plan is not and should not be a zoning plan, and it does not zone or rezone land. Furthermore, the plan carries with it no weight of law, and it does not bind the present governing body nor future elected officials as far as specific zoning of land or other actions recommended in the plan although the plan will be considered in making such decisions.

                  Sec. 66-136. - Procedures. 
                  (a)  Roads to be adopted into the county road system must have a completed right-of-way deed that has been signed by all applicable property owners. The public works director or his designee (including but not limited to an affected property owner) will be responsible for obtaining all necessary signatures. The deed shall be given to the county attorney in order to confirm its accuracy. If the county attorney determines the deed to be valid, the deed will be returned to the public works director with a statement certifying to the accuracy of the deed. If the county attorney determines that the deed is invalid, a statement of explanation will be returned along with the deed to the public works director. The public works director will recommend to the board of commissioners the adoption of all roads into the county road system for which completed right-of-way deeds have been obtained. 
                  (b)  Gravel roads proposed for adoption must have a minimum of 40 feet of right-of-way. Paved roads proposed for adoption must have a minimum 40 feet of right-of-way with a minimum pavement width of 20 feet. 
                  (c)  An application designed by the public works director, which contains certain descriptive information regarding a road proposed for adoption by the board of commissioners, must be completed. 
                  (d)  Under no circumstances will driveways be considered for adoption. Driveways are defined as a privately owned road providing access from a public thoroughfare to property owned by a single property owner, whether the property includes a single tract or multiple tracts. 
                  (e)  All roads proposed for inclusion in the county road system and/or proposals for adopting additional right-of-way on existing county roads must be approved by the board of commissioners at an official meeting. Upon official adoption, the county clerk will stamp the deed with a notice indicating the date of adoption by the board of commissioners. 
                  (f)  After official adoption of roads by the board of commissioners, the county attorney shall record the deed in the clerk of superior court's office. The county attorney will return a copy of the recorded deed to the public works director. 
                  (g)  The public works director will forward to the department of transportation a completed local certification acceptance form, a copy of the recorded deed, and a copy of the county road map with the location of the road indicated. A copy of the same material shall also be provided to the tax assessor's office. 
                  (h)  In cases of extreme extenuating circumstances (i.e., immovable structures) that would prevent obtaining the right-of-way width otherwise required by this section, the board of commissioners will consider petitions by affected property owners for a variance to this article.

                  ARTICLE VI. - ROAD MAINTENANCE AND PAVING POLICY 

                  Sec. 66-166. - Procedures. 
                  (a)  In June of each year, the public works director will prepare a list of roads to be submitted to the state department of transportation (DOT) requesting state aide. The request may include aggregate surface course (gravel), striping, and asphalt for paving (first time and/or resurfacing). Unless a variance is granted by the board of commissioners and the DOT, only roads with a minimum 60-foot right-of-way will be considered for paving material request. The public works director will submit this proposed list to the county administrator for review. The list, in turn, will be submitted to the board of commissioners for review and approval. Upon approval, the public works director will forward a copy of the request to the DOT. Additionally, when local funds are available, a paving list may be prepared for roads with 40-foot rights-of-way. 
                  (b)  In determining priority for road work (with the exception of routine maintenance), the public works director shall use a criterion-based ranking system which takes into account such factors as: 
                  (1)  Number of dwellings on the road. 
                  (2)  Number of residents living on the road. 
                  (3)  Length of the road. 
                  (4)  If the road is a postal route. 
                  (5)  If the road is a school bus route. 
                  (6)  If the road is a connector road. 
                  (7)  Traffic count. 
                  (8)  Apparent age of the road. 
                  (9)  County cost per mile. 
                  (10)  Overall condition of the road. 
                  Other relevant factors may also be considered by the public works director. A description of the ranking system should be provided to the county administrator and the board of commissioners for review upon development. Additionally, a summary of the individual road scores should be included with the proposed list submitted to the county administrator and the board of commissioners. 
                  (c)  If in the opinion of the public works director it is not prudent for the county to directly undertake any facet of road construction work that is required, he shall advise the county administrator of the situation. If the county administrator concurs, the public works director will be instructed to solicit bids for the required work. The bids will be opened and considered at an official meeting of the board of commissioners.

The utility owner shall place the necessary barricades, warning signs, signals, lights and, if necessary, guards for the protection of the traveling public, and further agrees by the acceptance of the permit to keep and hold the county harmless from any and all damages caused by negligence on the part of the utility owner, its agents, servants, officers or employees, or contractors, engaged in doing such work, or any injuries or damages suffered by anyone as a result thereof. All traffic safety measures will be in accordance with the state department of transportation's Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices, a copy of which shall be available for inspection at the office of the planning director. 
                  (c)  All facilities shall be installed in accordance with the state department of transportation's Utility Accommodation Policy and Standard where applicable. The document will be maintained on file in the office of the county planning director.

                  Sec. 78-192. - Imposition of tax. 
                  (a)  Imposition and rate of tax. 
                  (1)  There is levied and assessed, and there shall be paid a tax of five percent of the rent for every occupancy of a guest room in a hotel in the unincorporated area of the county. 
                  (2)  The tax imposed by this article shall be paid upon any occupancy on and after March 1, 1993, although such occupancy is had pursuant to a contract, lease or other arrangement made prior to such date. Rent paid, charged or billed shall be subject to the tax to the extent that it covers any portion of the period from March 1, 1993. 
                  (b)  Persons liable for tax; extinguishment of liability. Every person occupying a guest room in a hotel in the unincorporated area of the county is liable for the tax. His liability is not extinguished until the tax has been paid to this county. However, a receipt given to the occupant pursuant to section 78-193(a) from an operator maintaining a place of business in this county or from an operator who is authorized to collect the tax by the county administrator is sufficient to relieve the occupant from further liability for the tax. 
                  (c)  Unlawful advertising regarding tax. It is unlawful for any operator to hold out or state to the public or to any guest, directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part of the tax will be assumed or absorbed by the operator or that it will not be added to the rental of the guest room, or that, if added, it or any part will be refunded. 
                  (d)  Exemptions. No tax shall be imposed under this article upon a permanent resident of a hotel. 
                  (Ord. of 1-26-1993, § 2) 
                  Sec. 78-193. - Collection. 
                  (a)  Collection of tax by operator; receipt to occupant; rules for collection; schedules. Every operator maintaining a place of business in the unincorporated area of the county shall collect the tax at the time of collecting rent from the occupant and on demand shall give to the occupant a receipt. In all cases of transactions upon credit or deferred payment, the payment of tax to the operator may be deferred; and the operator shall be liable at the time and to the extent that such credits are incurred in accordance with the rate of tax owing on the amount. The county administrator shall have the power to adopt rules and regulations prescribing methods and schedules for the collection and payment of the tax. 
                  (b)  Registration of operator; form and contents; execution; certificate of authority. Every person engaging or about to engage in business as an operator of a hotel in the unincorporated area of the county shall immediately register with the county administrator. Persons engaged in such business must so register not later than 15 days after the date of the ordinance from which this section derives, but shall not relieve any person from the obligation of payment or collection of tax on and after the date of imposition, regardless of registration. Such registration shall set forth the same name under which such person transacts business or intends to transact business, the location of his place of business, and such other information that would facilitate the collection of the tax as the county administrator may require. The registration shall be signed by the owner if a natural person; in case of ownership by an association or partnership, by a member or partner; in the case of ownership by a corporation, by an executive officer or some person specifically authorized by the corporation to sign the registration. The county administrator shall, after such registration, issue without charge a certificate of authority to each operator to collect the tax. Each certificate shall state the name and location of the business to which it is applicable and shall be prominently displayed so as to be seen and readily noticed by all occupants and persons seeking occupancy. Such certificates shall be nonassignable and nontransferable and shall be returned immediately to the county administrator upon the cessation of business at the location named, or upon the sale or transfer of such business. Should the county administrator deem it necessary, in order to facilitate initial registration of persons engaged in business, he may prescribe administrative provisions other than those provided in this section. Such provisions shall be made to effect the purposes of this article. 
                  (c)  Determination, returns and payments. 
                  (1)  Due date of taxes. The tax imposed by this article shall become due and payable from the occupant at the time of occupancy of any hotel in the unincorporated area of the county. The taxes collected by any operator shall be due and payable to the county administrator monthly on or before the 20th day of each monthly period. 
                  (2)  Return; time of filing; persons required to file; execution. On or before the 20th day of each monthly period, a return for the preceding monthly period shall be filed with the county administrator in such form as the county administrator may prescribe, by every operator, liable for the payment of tax under this article. 
                  (3)  Contents of return. All returns shall show the gross rent, rent from permanent residents, taxable rent, amount of tax collected or otherwise due for the related period, and such other information as may be required by the county administrator. 
                  (4)  Delivery of return and remittance. The person required to file the return shall deliver the return, together with the remittance of the net amount of tax due to the county administrator at the county courthouse. 
                  (5)  Collection fee allowed operators. Operators collecting the tax shall be allowed a percentage of the tax due and accounted for and shall be reimbursed in the form of a deduction in submitting, reporting and paying the amount due, if the amount is not delinquent at the time of payment. The rate of the deduction shall be the same rate authorized for deductions from state tax under the State Sales and Use Tax Law, O.C.G.A. § 48-8-50. 
                  (Ord. of 1-26-1993, § 3) 
                  Sec. 78-194. - Deficiency determinations. 
                  (a)  Recomputation of tax; authority to make; basis of recomputation. If the county administrator is not satisfied with the return or returns of the tax or the amount of the tax required to be paid to the county by any person, he may compute and determine the amount required to be paid upon the basis of any information within his possession or that may come into his possession. One or more than one deficiency determination may be made of the amount due for one or more than one monthly period. 
                  (b)  Interest on deficiency. The amount of the determination, exclusive of penalties, shall bear interest at the rate of one percent per month, or fraction of a month from the 20th day after the close of the monthly period for which the amount or any portion should have been returned until the date of payment. 
                  (c)  Offsetting of overpayments. In making a determination, the county administrator may offset overpayments for a period or periods against underpayments of another period or periods against penalties and interest on underpayments. The interest on underpayments shall be computed in the manner set forth in subsection (b) of this section. 
                  (d)  Penalty; negligence or disregard of rules and regulations. If any part of the deficiency for which a deficiency determination has been made is due to negligence or disregard of rules and regulations, a penalty of 15 percent of the amount of such deficiency shall be added. 
                  (e)  Penalty for fraud or intent to evade. If any part of the deficiency for which a deficiency determination is made due to fraud or an intent to evade any provisions of this article or other authorized rules and regulations, a penalty of 25 percent of the deficiency shall be added. 
                  (f)  Notice of county administrator's determination; service of. The county administrator shall give to the operator written notice of his determination. The notice may be served personally or by mail; if by mail, such service shall be addressed to the operator at his address as it appears in the records of the county administrator. In case of service by mail of any notice required by this article, service is complete at the time of deposit in the United States Post Office. 
                  (g)  Time within which notice of deficiency determination to be mailed. Except in the case of fraud, intent to evade this article or authorized rules or regulations, or failure to mail a return, every notice of a deficiency determination shall be mailed within three years after the 20th day of the calendar month following the monthly period for which the amount is proposed to be determined, or within three years after the return is filed, whichever period should last expire. 
                  (Ord. of 1-26-1993, § 4) 
                  Sec. 78-195. - Determination if no return made. 
                  (a)  Estimate of gross receipts. If any person fails to make a return, the county administrator shall make an estimate of the amount of the gross receipts of the person or of the amount of total rentals in the unincorporated area of the county that are subject to the tax. The estimate shall be made for the period in which the person failed to make a return and shall be based upon any information that may come into the possession of the county administrator. On the basis of this estimate, the county administrator shall compute and determine the amount required to be paid the county, adding to the sum thus determined a penalty equal to 15 percent. One or more determinations may be made for one or for more than one period. 
                  (b)  Manner of computation; offsets; interest. In making a determination, the county administrator may offset overpayments for a period or penalties against the interest on the underpayments. The interest on underpayments shall be computed in the manner set forth in section 78-194(b). 
                  (c)  Penalty for fraud or intent to evade. If the failure of any person to file a return is due to fraud or an intent to evade this article, a penalty of 25 percent of the amount required to be paid by the person, exclusive of penalties, shall be added in addition to the 15 percent penalty provided in subsection (a) of this section. 
                  (d)  Giving of notice; manner of service. After making his determination, the county administrator shall give the person written notice to be served personally or by mail in the manner prescribed for service of notice of a deficiency determination. 
                  (Ord. of 1-26-1993, § 5) 
                  Sec. 78-196. - Penalty for failure to pay tax. 
                  Any person who fails to pay the tax imposed in this article or fails to pay any amount of such tax required to be collected within the time required shall pay a penalty of 15 percent of the tax, as well as the tax plus interest as set forth in section 78-194(b). 
                  (Ord. of 1-26-1993, § 6) 
                  Sec. 78-197. - Collection of tax. 
                  (a)  Security the county administrator may exact; amount; sale of; notice of sale; return of surplus. 
                  (1)  The county administrator, whenever he deems it necessary to ensure compliance with this article, may require any person subject to this article to deposit with him such security as the county administrator may determine. The amount of the security shall be fixed by the county administrator but shall not be greater than twice the person's estimated average liability for the period for which he files returns, determined in such a manner as the county administrator deems proper, or $5,000.00, whichever amount is the lesser. 
                  (2)  The amount of the security may be increased by the county administrator subject to the limitations provided in this section. The county administrator may sell the security at public auction, with the approval of the board of commissioners, if it becomes necessary in order to recover any tax or any amount required to be collected. Notice of the sale may be served upon the person who deposited the security personally or by mail; if by mail, service shall be made in the manner prescribed concerning service of a notice of a deficiency determination and shall be addressed to the person at his address as it appears in the records of the county administrator. Upon any sale, any surplus above the amounts due shall be returned to the person who deposited the security. 
                  (b)  Action for tax; time for. At any time within three years after any tax or amount of tax required to be collected becomes due and payable and at any time within three years after the delinquency of any tax or any amount of tax required to be collected, the county administrator may bring action in the courts of this state, of any other state, or of the United States in the name of the county to collect the amount delinquent, together with penalties and interest, court fees, filing fees, attorney's fees and other legal fees incident to such action. 
                  (c)  Duty of successors or assignees of operator to withhold tax from purchase money. If any operator liable for any amount under this article sells out his business or quits the business, his successors or assigns shall withhold sufficient of the purchase price to cover such amount until the former owner produces a receipt from the county administrator showing that he has been paid or a certificate stating that no amount is due. 
                  (d)  Liability for failure to withhold; certificate of notice of amount due; time to enforce successor's liability. If the purchaser of a business fails to withhold the purchase price as required, he becomes personally liable for the payment of the amount required to be withheld by him to the extent of the purchase price, valued in money. Within 30 days after receiving a written request from the purchaser for a certificate, the county administrator shall either issue the certificate or mail it to the purchaser at his address as it appears on the records of the county administrator of the amount that must be paid as a condition of issuing the certificate. The time within which the obligation of a successor may be enforced shall start to run at the time the operator sells or at the time that the determination against the operator becomes final, whichever event occurs later. 
                  (e)  Tax credit, penalty or interest paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected. Whenever the amount of any tax, penalty or interest has been paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the county under this article, it may be offset as provided in section 78-194(e). If the operator or person determines that he has overpaid or paid more than once, which fact has not been determined by the county administrator, he will have three years from date of payment to file a written claim stating the specific ground upon which the claim is founded. The claim shall be audited; and if the claim is approved by the county administrator, the excess amount paid the county may be credited on any amounts then due and payable from the person by whom it was paid, or his administrators or executors. 
                  (Ord. of 1-26-1993, § 7) 
                  Sec. 78-198. - Administration of article.

                  (e)  Authority to require reports; contents. In the administration of the provisions of this article, the county administrator may require the filing of reports by any person or class of persons having in their possession or custody information relating to rentals of guest rooms subject to the tax. The reports shall be filed with the county administrator when required by him and shall set forth the rental charged for each occupancy, the dates of occupancy, and such other information as the county administrator may require. 
                  (f)  Disclosure of business of operators; limitation on rule. The county administrator or any person having an administrative duty under this article shall not make known in any manner the business affairs, operations or information obtained by an audit of books, papers, records, financial reports, equipment and other facilities of any operator or any other person visited or examined in the discharge of official duty, or the amount or source of income, profits, losses, expenditures or any particular set forth or disclosed in any return, or to permit any return or copy or any book containing any abstract or particulars to be seen or examined by any person not having administrative duty under this article, except judicial proceedings or other proceedings necessary to collect the tax levied and assessed by this article. Successors, receivers, trustees, executors, administrators, assignees and guarantors, if directly interested, may be given information as to the items included in the measure and amount of unpaid tax or amounts of tax required to be collected.
