                  \PREFACE 
                  This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of Jefferson County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1996 Code, as supplemented through July 13, 1998, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1996 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

               --- (1) --- 
               Editor's note— Printed herein is 1984 Ga. Laws, page 3627, which provided for a board of commissioners of the county. Amendments to the act are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original act. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. 
               
               Section 1. - Establishment; powers. 
               There shall be a board of commissioners of Jefferson County which shall be the governing authority of Jefferson County and which shall have, in addition to such other powers as may be granted by other laws, the powers of a judge of the probate court when sitting for county purposes as provided by O.C.G.A. § 36-5-1. 
               Editor's note— 1987 Ga. Laws, page 1482, repealed provisions codified as O.C.G.A. §§ 36-5-1 through 36-5-8. 
               Section 2. - Composition. 
               The board of commissioners shall consist of a chairman and four other members. 
               Section 3. - Eligibility for office; commissioner districts. 
               (a)  No person shall be a member of the board if that person is ineligible for such office pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 45-2-1 or any other general law. 
               (b)  In order to be elected as a member of the board from a commissioner district, a person must be a resident of that district prior to election thereto. Each member shall be elected by the electors voting within the respective commissioner district and not at large and must receive the number of votes cast for that office as required by general law. Only electors who are residents of that commissioner district may vote for a member of the board for that district. At the time of qualifying for election as a member of the board from a commissioner district, each candidate for such office shall specify the commissioner district for which that person is a candidate. A person elected as a member of the board from a commissioner district must continue to reside in that district during that person's term of office or that office shall thereupon become vacant. 
               (c)  The member of the board who is chairperson of the board may reside anywhere within Jefferson County and must receive the number of votes cast for such office as required by general law in the entire county. The chairperson must continue to reside within Jefferson County during that person's term of office or that office shall thereupon become vacant. 
               (d)  Those members of the board of commissioners of Jefferson County who are serving as such immediately prior to the effective date of this Act and any person selected to fill a vacancy in any such office shall continue to serve as such members until the regular expiration of their respective terms of office and upon the election and qualification of their respective successors. On and after the effective date of this Act, the board of commissioners of Jefferson County shall consist of five members all of whom shall be elected from commissioner districts described in subsection (e) of this section except for the member who is chairperson and who is elected at large as provided in this Act. 
               (e)  For purposes of electing members of the board of commissioners, other than the chairperson, Jefferson County is divided into four commissioner districts. One member of the board shall be elected from each such district. The four commissioner districts shall be and correspond to those four numbered districts described in and attached to and made a part of this Act [inserted at the end of this section] and further identified as Plan Name: jeffwkl Plan Type: Local User: Tara Administrator: Jefferson. 
               (f)  When used in such attachment, the terms 'Tract' and 'BG' (Block Group) shall mean and describe the same geographical boundaries as provided in the report of the Bureau of the Census for the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. The separate numeric designations in a Tract description which are underneath a 'BG' heading shall mean and describe individual Blocks within a Block Group as provided in the report of the Bureau of the Census for the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. Any part of Jefferson County which is not included in any such district described in that attachment shall be included within that district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. Any part of Jefferson County which is described in that attachment as being in a particular district shall nevertheless not be included within such district if such part is not contiguous to such district. Such noncontiguous part shall instead be included within that district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. Except as otherwise provided in the description of any commissioner district, whenever the description of such district refers to a named city, it shall mean the geographical boundaries of that city as shown on the census map for the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. 
               (g)  Commissioner Districts 1, 2, 3, and 4, as they exist immediately prior to the effective date of this Act, shall continue to be designated as Commissioner Districts 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, but as newly described under this Act, and on and after the effective date of this Act, such members of the board serving from those former commissioner districts shall be deemed to be serving from and representing their respective districts as newly described under this Act.

                  (b)  The style of all ordinances shall be: "Be it ordained by the Board of Commissioners of Jefferson County, as follows:…."

                  (b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code that have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
                  (c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified Code. For example, the codifier may: 
                  (1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
                  (2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles; 
                  (3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers; 
                  (4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _____ to _____" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); 
                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; 
                  but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

                  (b)  The phrase "violation of this Code" does not include the failure of a county officer or county employee to perform an official duty, unless it is provided that failure to perform the duty is to be punished as provided in this section or it is clear from the context of this Code that it is the intent of the county to impose the penalty provided for in this section upon the county officer or employee. 
                  (c)  Except as otherwise provided in this Code a person convicted of a violation of this Code shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000.00, imprisonment for a term not exceeding 90 days, or work on the streets or public works for a period not exceeding 90 days, or any combination thereof.

                  (f)  Each day any violation of this Code or other ordinance shall continue shall constitute a separate offense.

                  (h)  The imposition of a penalty does not prohibit equitable relief. 
                  (i)  The imposition of a penalty does not prohibit revocation or suspension of a license, permit, or franchise or the imposition of other administrative sanctions. 
                  (j)  If it is deemed by a court of competent jurisdiction that a punishment imposed under this Code conflicts with state law, the punishment shall be the maximum permitted by such law.

                  Sec. 2-207. - Objectives. 
                  (a)  Program objectives are essential to the implementation and administration of a meaningful, viable, and successful purchasing program. Program objectives spell out in words what is expected of the program and of the individuals who administer and participate in it. Program objectives also serve as a set of guidelines to be used by management, operating personnel and the purchasing agent in reaching responsible and intelligent decisions relative to the day-to-day administration of the program. Over the long run, program objectives provide management with a set of general standards against which to gauge the effectiveness and success to the program. 
                  (b)  The primary objectives of the purchasing program are to: 
                  (1)  Establish an ongoing centralized purchasing function capable of providing daily service and support on an organization-wide basis. 
                  (2)  Introduce a greater measure of responsibility and accountability over implementation of the annual budget, specifically as related to the procurement of commodities, contractual services, and capital outlay items. 
                  (3)  Assure realization of the principles of competitive purchasing and the best buy at the least cost. 
                  (4)  Assist management at all levels in reaching responsible cost-efficient decisions in the procurement of quality supplies and services for county use. 
                  (5)  Formulate policies and procedures designed to systematize and enhance the efficiency of the county procurement process and assure procurement in a timely and proper manner.

                  (7)  Promote the realization of equal opportunity policies through procurement relations with vendors. 
                  Sec. 2-208. - Centralized purchasing. 
                  It shall be the policy of the county to maintain a centralized purchasing process by creating and maintaining the position of purchasing agent whose responsibility it is to administer purchasing polices, institute reports necessary to permit analysis of purchasing performance, negotiate and make recommendations for term contracts in concert with county departments, consolidate purchases of like or common items, analyze prices paid for materials and equipment, and generally define how to obtain savings and coordinate purchasing procedures. 
                  Sec. 2-209. - Sources of supply. 
                  (a)  The purchasing agent shall select sources of supply in concert with the appropriate department. This shall be accomplished with the view toward creating good vendor relations and promoting the best interest of the county. 
                  (b)  The county recognizes that frankness and fair dealing comprise the cornerstones to strong and lasting relationships with suppliers. As a general policy, purchases shall be awarded on the basis of availability, best price, delivery and quality taking into consideration the reputation and performance of the suppliers. 
                  (c)  While recognizing the need to follow the dictates of subsections (a) and (b) of this section for the use and maintenance of sources of supply, the board of commissioners recognizes the need to "keep taxpayers' money in the county." 
                  (d)  Positive consideration for any bid or proposal will be made when a vendor is located in the county if that vendor's bid or proposal is no more than three percent greater than the next lowest, and if that vendor would otherwise meet the requirements of being the successful bidder. 
                  Sec. 2-210. - Commitments. 
                  (a)  The purchasing agent, in concert with county departments, shall conduct and conclude all negotiations affecting vendor selection, prices, terms, delivery, etc. In order to be valid, all commitments shall be stated by contract, letter or purchase order signed by the purchasing agent or county administrator. Negotiations leading up to or likely to conclude in, contract arrangements shall not be conducted without the knowledge of the purchasing agent and county administrator. 
                  (b)  No one other than the purchasing agent and the county administrator shall commit the county to any purchase, vendor, or product, or give any information concerning price or competitive performance. 
                  Sec. 2-211. - Interdepartmental relations. 
                  (a)  A central purchasing system cannot function properly without the cooperation and assistance of all department heads. It shall be the policy of the county to promote an intelligent and harmonious relationship between the purchasing agent and other county departments relative to procurement. 
                  (b)  The purchasing agent has the duty and the authority to request reconsideration of specifications or quality of material if, in his opinion, it appears that the interest of the county may be better served. 
                  (c)  To enable the purchasing agent to develop the best source of supply, requisitions should be submitted as far in advance of the required date as possible. Useful information obtained by the purchasing agent from salesmen's interviews and direct mail should be forwarded to the appropriate county departments. Using departments are encouraged to reciprocate by following useful information on materials and suppliers to the purchasing agent. 
                  Sec. 2-212. - Vendor relations. 
                  The purchasing agent will promote a program of fairness and friendship with all vendors. Salesmen will be received by the purchasing agent as promptly and courteously as time permits. 
                  (1)  Salesmen will be received in other departments only after approval has been given, or arrangements have been made by the purchasing agent. 
                  (2)  The purchasing agent will arrange interviews between vendor representatives and department heads when it appears to be to the advantage of the county or when such an interview is requested by an appropriate county employee. 
                  (3)  No county employee is required to place his time at the disposal or discretion of salesmen. However, if any interview is to be denied, such will be acknowledged promptly, a reason given for not granting the interview, and the suggestion offered to see the purchasing agent. 
                  (4)  The purchasing agent will handle all correspondence with suppliers except when technical or other details make it necessary or appropriate to assign such correspondence to another department. 
                  (5)  The purchasing agent will advise unsuccessful bidders as to the disposition of their quotations or bids at the request of the unsuccessful bidders. 
                  (6)  Prices and other specific information received from vendors shall be considered confidential. During negotiations, quotations received from one supplier will not be divulged to another. The contents of the bid or proposal will only be released in accordance with provisions of the Jefferson County Open Records Act Policy and the county's personnel policy. 
                  (7)  Vendor representatives who are unavailable at the time the purchasing agent calls to request information of the status of an order or other inquiry, are requested to return the call by the end of the working day on which it is made. 
                  (8)  Salesmen calling on the county should be prepared to advise the purchasing agent on the status of existing county orders with their company. 
                  Sec. 2-213. - Conflict of interest. 
                  (a)  Employees who are in a position to influence actions and decisions regarding any county purchasing activity shall refrain from relations, which may adversely affect the exercise of independent judgment in dealing with suppliers. 
                  (b)  An outside personal economic relationship, which affords present or future financial benefits to an employee, his family or individuals with whom he has business or financial ties are prohibited in accordance with the Jefferson County Personnel Policy. 
                  Sec. 2-214. - Acceptance of gifts or gratuities. 
                  No employee shall accept gifts, gratuities of loans from organizations, business concerns or individuals with whom he has official relationships with the county. The limitations are not intended to prohibit the acceptance of articles of negligible value which are distributed generally or to prohibit employees from obtaining loans from regular lending institutions. 
                  Sec. 2-215. - Performance bonds. 
                  The county shall require a performance bond before entering a bid-based contract, in such an amount as shall be found necessary to protect the best interest of the county. 
                  Sec. 2-216. - Bidders list. 
                  The purchasing agent shall, with the aid of other department heads, compile and maintain a bidders list. Vendors desiring to be listed shall advise the purchasing agent, in writing, of the following: 
                  (1)  Type of business. 
                  (2)  Name of officers, owners, or partners. 
                  (3)  Persons authorized to sign bids, offers, and/or contracts.

                  The board of commissioners will award bid-based contracts upon the recommendation of the county administrator and the purchasing agent. The award will usually be to the lowest and best responsible bidder. When an award is not to be made, or not to the lowest bidder, a full and complete statement of the reasons shall be prepared by the purchasing agent and shall be filed along with other papers relating to the transaction. 
                  Sec. 2-218. - Employee bidding. 
                  No county employee, constitutional officer, elected official, or county commissioner, will be eligible to bid on county contracts, supply items, or any construction of any type.

                  State Law reference— Purchasing preferences for local government contracts, O.C.G.A. § 36-84-1; certain county purchases prohibited, O.C.G.A. § 36-1-14; local political subdivision purchases, O.C.G.A. § 50-5-100 et seq. 

                  Sec. 2-245. - Purpose and intent. 
                  These procedures outline the county's purchasing procedure and the forms system designated to complement it. The procedure outlined below is designed to take full advantage of a centralized purchasing system. 
                  Sec. 2-246. - Purchase requisition. 
                  (a)  The purchase requisition initiates the procurement cycle. The receipt of a purchase requisition with the necessary information and required signature gives the authority for each specific purchase. A purchase order will not be issued unless authorized by a proper requisition. The purchase requisition makes the purchasing agent accountable for filling the needs as stated on the requisition. The signature of the department head is required on all purchase requisitions. 
                  (b)  The purchase requisition shall be used for the following: 
                  (1)  To request the purchase of supplies or services (except engineering and other professional services). 
                  (2)  To change or cancel an existing purchase requisition. 
                  (3)  To request price and delivery information on possible requirements. 
                  (c)  The purchase requisition will be a single part form available from central supplies. The completed form is to be forwarded to the purchasing agent who will review the purchase requisition for the purpose of assuring that all required information is provided, that the price indicated is the "best price," that budget compliance/variance is known, and that contract compliance be discussed directly with the requisitioner. 
                  (d)  A purchase requisition shall include all of the following information: 
                  (1)  Date the purchase requisition is prepared. 
                  (2)  Complete ship-to address. 
                  (3)  Expenditure code number, line item of account. 
                  (4)  Indication whether the purchase is budgeted or unbudgeted. 
                  (5)  Proper numbers of fund, program, and expenditure chart of account. 
                  (6)  Project number (or name) if applicable. 
                  (7)  A definite date for completion should always be given. Terms such as "emergency" and "rush" may be used, but also include a firm date. The term "a.s.a.p." should not be used. 
                  (8)  If known, one or more suppliers should be recommended. If the requisitioner feels a particular supplier should not be used, it should be so stated along with the purchase requisition with a brief explanation. 
                  (9)  The quantity requested should clearly identify measurable units such as pieces, sheets, pounds, gallons, feet, etc. 
                  (10)  Descriptions should be complete and detailed. Specifications should be written so that no guess work is required. If a specification such as color is not important, it should be so stated on the purchase requisition. If known, the manufacturer and part number should be shown. 
                  (11)  The unit price or an estimated unit price. 
                  (12)  The requisitioner should include on or attached to the purchase requisition any useful information whatsoever that will assist in making the best possible buy on the needed supplies or services 
                  Sec. 2-247. - Vendor selection. 
                  Vendors will be selected on a competitive basis. Bids, quotations, and proposals will be solicited by newspaper advertising, direct mail, requests of prospective suppliers and by telephone, as appropriate. Purchase orders or contracts will be awarded to the lowest and best responsible vendor. (Exception: When a local qualified vendor submits a bid that is up to three percent greater than a vendor from outside the county, the bid will be awarded to the local vendor). All bids may be rejected if it is in the public interest to do so. In determining the "lowest and best responsible vendor" or "qualified vendor" in addition to price, the following will be considered: 
                  (1)  The ability, capacity, and skill of the vendor to perform the contract or provide material or services required. 
                  (2)  Whether the vendor can perform the contract or provide the material or service promptly or within the time specified without delay or interference. 
                  (3)  The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience, and efficiency of the vendor. 
                  (4)  The quality of performance of previous contracts, orders, or services. 
                  (5)  The previous and existing compliance by the vendor and laws and ordinances relating to the contract, order or service. 
                  (6)  The sufficiency of the financial resources and ability of the vendor to perform the contract, fill the order, or provide the service. 
                  (7)  The quality, availability and adaptability of the supplier, or contractual services to the particular use required. 
                  (8)  The ability of the vendor to provide future maintenance and service of the use of the subject of the contract. 
                  (9)  The number and scope of conditions attached to the bid. 
                  Sec. 2-248. - Invitation for bids and request for quotations. 
                  (a)  The invitation for bid will include: 
                  (1)  A general description of the items to be purchased; 
                  (2)  The bid deposit and performance bond required, if any; 
                  (3)  Place where bid blanks and specifications may be secured; and 
                  (4)  The time and place for opening bids. 
                  The purchasing agent may also solicit sealed bids from responsible prospective suppliers by sending them a copy of such notice. Sealed bids will be opened in public at the time and place stated in the invitation for bid. A tabulation of bids can be obtained from the purchasing office after the opening. 
                  (b)  Purchases of less than $500.00 will be made in the open market without necessary resort to invitation for bids or request for quotations. 
                  (c)  Purchases of $501.00 to $1,000.00 must have three bids which may be solicited either by telephone or written at the discretion of the purchasing agent. However, in those instances where the purchasing agent cannot secure at least three bids within a time frame of five working days, then two or less bids shall be considered adequate. 
                  (d)  Purchases of $1,001.00 to $5,000.00 require a written bid. Purchases over $5,000.00 require a written bid and must be approved by the commissioners' finance committee. All purchases over $7,500.00 require a written bid and must be approved by the full board of commissioners even if the purchase was on the approved annual budget. 
                  (e)  Purchases made from state contracts require no further bids. 
                  Sec. 2-249. - Negotiation. 
                  (a)  The invitation for bid method of formal advertising and to lesser extent the request for quotation method, involves the inflexible process of sealed bids, public opening, and award to the appropriate bidder as indicated above. Negotiation, on the other hand, usually involves after receipt of quotations, the process of bargaining with suppliers or offerors proffering the best deal to the county. 
                  (b)  Notwithstanding county procurement by negotiation, like procurement by formal advertising requires the observation of impartiality toward all offerors. 
                  (c)  While negotiation procedures are more flexible than advertised procedures, such flexibility demands a greater degree of care to ensure that all competitive offerors are treated equally. Negotiation, as a purchasing technique, shall be used only after authorization by the board of commissioners. 
                  Sec. 2-250. - Purchase orders. 
                  (a)  This procedure will deal with all formal orders. The purchase order is basically a legal contract. It represents a meeting of the minds between the buyer and seller. All formal purchase orders will be prepared, and issued by the purchasing agent. No purchase order will be issued without a properly processed purchase requisition. 
                  (b)  All purchases, except purchases of less than $200.00 whether for single or multiple items, will require a purchase order. 
                  (c)  The purchase order will be a numbered, three-part form. After the purchase order is executed, it will be issued as follows: 
                  (1)  White copy—Mailed to the vendor. 
                  (2)  Yellow copy—Maintained in the purchasing department. 
                  (3)  Pink copy—Accounting department. 
                  Sec. 2-251. - Purchase order log. 
                  The purchasing agent will maintain a purchase order log that will contain the following information: 
                  (1)  Purchase number. 
                  (2)  Date of purchase order. 
                  (3)  Department. 
                  (4)  Name of individual submitting purchase request. 
                  (5)  Dollar amount of purchase. 
                  Sec. 2-252. - Charge account procedures. 
                  (a)  The purchasing agent will issue purchase orders to selected vendors establishing charge accounts. This method of buying is intended to expedite the procurement of frequently needed low dollar value supplies. These blanket purchase orders will have $1,000.00 cumulative limit and no single purchase may be over $200.00. Department heads will forward a list containing the names and signatures of all personnel proposed to be authorized to sign for supplies under these agreements. Any changes to the name/signature list should be made in writing and filed with the purchasing agent. Any exceptions to this procedure will be authorized only upon receipt of an authorization signed by the county administrator or the chairperson of the finance committee or the chairperson of the board of commissioners. 
                  (b)  When charging supplies, the vendor's invoice must be signed by the authorized county personnel receiving the material. Department heads will immediately forward these signed invoices to the purchasing agent. The purchasing agent must have all signed invoices in order to verify the accuracy of the vendor's monthly bills. Invoices signed by unauthorized personnel will not be paid. 
                  Sec. 2-253. - Emergency purchases. 
                  Emergency purchases may be approved by the county administrator upon the request of the appropriate department head and recommendation of the purchasing agent. The board of commissioners' finance committee will be notified as soon as practicable by the county administrator after an emergency purchase has been made. 
                  Sec. 2-254. - Receipt and inspection. 
                  The ordering agency shall ultimately be responsible for the receipt, inspection, and acceptance of the incoming supplies and equipment in compliance with the following procedure: 
                  (1)  When any or all items on the purchase order have been received, inspected, and accepted, the delivery receipt shall be signed and forwarded to the purchasing agent. 
                  (2)  When received items are acceptable, the receiving agency shall forward to purchasing agent a receiving report with the reason for rejection stated thereon. The purchasing agent will then arrange for the return and replacement of the defective items, or take other action as required. In the case of defective supplies, the receiving report will also be used as a rejection report. 
                  (3)  When items that have already been accepted are subsequently found to be defective, the using department shall notify the purchasing agent in writing. The following information, when known, is required: 
                  a.  Name of supplier. 
                  b.  Purchase order number item was purchased on. 
                  c.  Date defective item was received. 
                  d.  Nature of defect. 
                  e.  Action requested (return for credit, for replacement, etc.). 
                  (4)  When items are to be received by or delivered to someone or someplace other than the suing agency, the above procedures shall be modified only to the extent that: 
                  a.  Someone other than a using department employee may sign the delivery receipt, but must notify the suing agency of receipt of the order. 
                  b.  Someone should satisfy themselves regarding the condition of the items, and check the items delivered against the machine copy of the purchase order. 
                  Sec. 2-255. - Payments. 
                  Most vendors offer a cash discount if their invoices are paid promptly.

                  DIVISION 4. - INVESTMENT POLICY 

                  Sec. 2-286. - Generally. 
                  It is the policy of the board of commissioners to invest public funds in accordance with state and local statutes governing the investment of public funds and meet the daily cash flow demands of the government in a manner which will provide the highest investment return with the maximum security. 
                  Sec. 2-287. - Scope. 
                  This investment policy applies to all assets of the county except as follows: 
                  (1)  Any funds that are restricted from investment by law, statute, regulations or contract. 
                  (2)  Investment activities by constitutional officers holding various trust and agency funds are not subject to the provisions of this policy. This does not prevent the transfer of fiduciary responsibility to the board of commissioners for investment activities. 
                  (3)  Investment activity by asset managers for retirement funds and deferred compensation funds are managed under a separate agreement. 
                  (4)  Paying agent funds and debt service reserve funds are managed under a separate agreement. 
                  Sec. 2-288. - Primary objectives. 
                  The primary objectives, in priority order, of the county investment program are: 
                  (1)  Legality. All investments shall comply with the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 36-83-4 and in accordance with local statutes. Investments related to bond issues which have specific investment policies contained within the bond ordinances and official statements will be adhered to and are not in conflict with the terms of this policy. 
                  (2)  Safety. Investments shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. To attain this objective, diversification is required in order that potential losses on individual securities do not exceed the income generated from the remainder of the portfolio. The objective will be to mitigate credit risk and interest risk. 
                  (3)  Liquidity. The investment portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable the county to meet all operating requirements which might be reasonably anticipated. Investments will be managed with a "buy and hold" philosophy. 
                  (4)  Yield or return on investment. The investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the county's investment risk constraints and the cash flow characteristics of the portfolio. 
                  Sec. 2-289. - Delegation of authority. 
                  Management responsibility for the investment program is retained by the board of commissioners. The county administrator is delegated with the responsibility to establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program consistent with this investment policy. Such procedures shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction except as provided under the terms of this policy and the procedures established by the county administrator. The county administrator shall be responsible for all transactions undertaken and shall establish a system of internal controls to regulate the activities of subordinate officials. 
                  Sec. 2-290. - Prudence. 
                  (a)  Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the primary objective of safety as well as the secondary objective of obtaining market rates of return. 
                  (b)  The standard of prudence to be used by investment officials shall be the "prudent person" standard and shall be applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio. Investment officers acting in accordance with written procedures and the investment policy and exercising due diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or market price changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments. 
                  Sec. 2-291. - Ethics and conflicts of interest. 
                  Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could conflict with proper execution of the investment program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees and investment officials shall disclose to the county administrator any material financial interests in financial institutions that conduct business within this jurisdiction, and they shall further disclose any large personal financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the county's portfolio. Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of Jefferson County, particularly with regard to the time of purchases and sales. 
                  Sec. 2-292. - Investment instruments. 
                  (a)  The county is empowered by O.C.G.A. § 36-83-4 to invest in the following type of securities:

                  (a)  Collateral securities for certificates of deposit and other investments shall be delivered to the government's depository bank for safekeeping, unless the certificate of deposit was purchased from that bank. In that event, collateral securities will be delivered to a third party bank with which the government has a fully executed and approved safekeeping agreement. 
                  (b)  Securities purchased under a repurchase agreement must be delivered to the government's depository bank for safekeeping, unless the repurchase agreement is executed with that bank. In that event securities will be delivered to a third party bank as provided for in subsection (a) of this section. 
                  (c)  Special requirements for repurchase agreement investments: 
                  (1)  Purchased securities will be "marked to market," i.e., current market value of securities purchased must meet or exceed cost of investment plus anticipated interest earnings. 
                  (2)  Margin of two percent to five percent of market value will be required in excess of cost of security plus interest. 
                  (3)  Market value will be reviewed monthly during term of investment, and additional securities may have to be delivered in order to maintain margin. 
                  (4)  No substitute of securities will be allowed during term of investment. This reinforces the concept that a repurchase agreement is a purchase-and-sell transaction. 
                  (5)  Payment for repurchase agreement investments will be made on a "delivery versus payment" basis, i.e., funds will not be wired from the depository bank until confirmation of the securities' delivery is received from the safekeeping bank.

                  Sec. 2-294. - Safekeeping and custody. 
                  All investment securities which can be physically delivered shall be held in safekeeping by the government's depository bank. Securities purchased on a book entry basis shall be conducted on a "delivery versus payment" basis. This ensures that securities are deposited in the eligible financial institution prior to the release of funds. 
                  Sec. 2-295. - Competitive selection of investment instruments. 
                  (a)  Competitive "bid" process shall be conducted for the investment of funds when appropriate and cost effective except those incorporated into the depository banking services agreement. If a specific maturity date is required, bids will be requested for instruments which meet the maturity requirement. If no specific maturity (within required time limitations) is required, a market trend (yield curve) analysis will be conducted to determine which maturities would be most advantageous. 
                  (b)  Bids will be requested from qualified financial institutions for various options with regard to term and instrument. The government will select the bid which provides the highest effective rate of return within the maturity required and within the parameters of this policy. 
                  (c)  The commissioner's office will maintain records of the bids offered, the bids accepted, and a brief explanation of the decision made regarding each investment selection. 
                  Sec. 2-296. - Authorized broker/dealers and financial institutions.

In addition, the finance department will conduct at least annually an evaluation of the firm's credit worthiness. Such evaluations may entail securing a private report from any one or more of several industry research organizations. 
                  (d)  Security dealers not affiliated with banks must provide at least quarterly financial reports and be classified as reporting dealers affiliated with the New York Federal Reserve Bank, as primary dealers. Dealers covered by and subject to the regulations of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) insurance program are preferred. 
                  (e)  Any financial institution or broker/dealer on the approved list must be registered in the state and maintain a full service office in the state.

Once the check has been processed, the check along with his financial transaction report, will be forwarded to the chief counselor. A copy of the check and a copy of the transaction report will be transmitted to the deputy warden to be placed in a permanent file maintained on a fiscal-year basis. The inmate's account will be closed out but will not be deleted from the computer files. 
                  Sec. 2-331. - Processing of checks. 
                  All checks will require two individuals to sign each check. These individuals will be preauthorized, in writing by the warden to sign these checks. Authorized signature cards will be on file at the bank. These signature cards will be updated as the staff changes dictate. 
                  Sec. 2-332. - Generating scheduled activity reports. 
                  On the last day of each month the computer operator will generate an inmate account balance report then place the report in a permanent file maintained on a fiscal-year basis in the computer operator's office.

                  Sec. 2-352. - Policy. 
                  (a)  The board of commissioners (the board) and staff of Jefferson County (the County) recognize the desirability of stated financial policies to assist in meeting the county government's basic objectives: 
                  (1)  The policies will assist the county in the objective of being publicly accountable and assist users of the financial statement to assess that accountability.

                  (b)  The county recognizes that the process of developing policies and supporting procedures to implement the policies is a dynamic process that must be continually reviewed. Accordingly, the county expects these policies to become a significant part of its system of internal control and provide the following benefits: 
                  (1)  Reduce misunderstanding, duplication of effort, errors and inefficiency. 
                  (2)  Provide a comprehensive, consistent methodology for similar transactions.

                  Sec. 2-371. - Purpose. 
                  The County is committed to preparing financial reports which are in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), standards set by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB), and laws of the State of Georgia. 
                  (Policy of 4-16-2014) 
                  Sec. 2-372. - Policy. 
                  (a)  The county shall produce interim reports as needed to ensure budgetary control of operations and capital programs. 
                  (b)  The county's accounting and financial reporting systems will be maintained in conformance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and standards of the Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB).

                  Subdivision 3. - Revenue 

                  Sec. 2-391. - Purpose. 
                  The county shall attempt to maintain a diversified and stable revenue system to shelter it from short-run fluctuations in any single revenue source. The revenue mix shall combine elastic and inelastic revenue sources to minimize the effect of an economic downturn. 
                  (Policy of 4-16-2014) 
                  Sec. 2-392. - Policy. 
                  (a)  The county will estimate its annual revenues by an objective analytical and conservative process utilizing trend, judgmental, and statistical analysis as appropriate. 
                  (b)  Each existing and potential revenue source will be re-examined annually. 
                  (c)  The county will aggressively seek public and private grants, contracts, and other outside sources of funding projects when appropriate. 
                  (d)  The county shall follow an aggressive policy of collecting revenues. 
                  (e)  User fees will be adjusted annually to recover the full cost of services provided, except when the county commission determines that a subsidy from the general fund is in the public interest. 
                  (f)  One-time revenues will be used for one-time expenditures only. 
                  (Policy of 4-16-2014)

                  Subdivision 4. - Reserves/Governmental Funds 

                  Sec. 2-411. - Purpose. 
                  The accumulation of reserves protects the county from uncontrollable increases in expenditures, extraordinary losses, unforeseen reductions in revenues, or a combination of these items. It also allows for prudent replacement and financing of capital construction and replacement projects. With the implementation of GASB Statement No. 54, Fund Balance Reporting and Governmental Fund Type Definitions, the overall definitions and classifications of governmental fund balances have changed. 
                  (Policy of 4-16-2014) 
                  Sec. 2-412. - Policy. 
                  Fund equity in the governmental fund financial statements is classified as fund balance. Generally, fund balance represents the difference between current assets and current liabilities. In the fund financial statements, governmental funds report fund balance classifications that comprise a hierarchy based primarily on the extent to which the county is bound to honor constraints on the specific purposes for which amounts in those funds can be spent. 
                  (Policy of 4-16-2014) 
                  Sec. 2-413. - Classifications. 
                  (a)  Nonspendable — (Inherently nonspendable). Fund balances are reported as nonspendable when amounts cannot be spent because they are either (a) not in spendable form (such as inventory or prepaids) or (b) legally or contractually required to be maintained intact (such as the principal of an endowment fund). 
                  (b)  Restricted — (Externally enforceable limitations on use). Fund balances are reported as restricted when there are limitations imposed on their use either through the enabling legislation adopted by the county or through external restrictions imposed by creditors, grantors, contributors, or laws or regulations of other governments or imposed by law through state statute. 
                  (c)  Committed — (Self-imposed limitations set in place prior to the end of the period). Fund balances are reported as committed when they can be used only for specific purposes pursuant to constraints imposed by formal action of the board through the adoption of a formal policy. Only the Board may modify or rescind the commitment. 
                  (d)  Assigned — (Limitation resulting from intended use). Fund balances are reported as assigned when amounts are constrained by the board's intent to be used for specific purposes, but are neither restricted nor committed. Authorization to assign fund balance remains with the board. 
                  (e)  Unassigned — (Residual net resources). Fund balances are reported as unassigned when the balance does not meet any of the above criterion. The county reports positive unassigned fund balance in the general fund only. Negative unassigned fund balances may be reported in all governmental funds. 
                  (Policy of 4-16-2014) 
                  Sec. 2-414. - Flow assumptions. 
                  When both restricted and unrestricted amounts of fund balance are available for use for expenditures incurred, the county shall use restricted amounts first and then unrestricted amounts as they are needed. For unrestricted amounts of fund balance, the county shall use fund balance in the following order: 
                  •  Committed 
                  •  Assigned 
                  •  Unassigned 
                  (Policy of 4-16-2014) 
                  Sec. 2-415. - Minimum fund balance. 
                  The county will make every feasible effort to maintain a general fund unassigned fund balance of not less than 25 percent of the annual operating budget. This minimum fund balance, which may only be used as required by authority of the board, is to provide for operating contingencies in either revenues or expenditures, and to provide adequate funds to operate without short-term borrowing. In the event the unassigned fund balance falls below the minimum amount, the county administrator will present a plan to the board as part of the subsequent fiscal year's annual budget to replenish the fund balance to the established minimum level in a reasonable time frame, generally one to three years. Budget surpluses will first be used towards replenishment, followed by the use of non-recurring revenues. 
                  (Policy of 4-16-2014) 
                  Sec. 2-416. - Contingency. 
                  A contingency amount shall be appropriated annually as part of the budget within the general fund, and other funds as deemed necessary, and shall be used for paying unexpected or unanticipated expenditures of an operational nature during the fiscal year. Within the general fund, this amount should approximate one to two percent of the general fund budget. 
                  (Policy of 4-16-2014)

                  Subdivision 5. - Budget Preparation 

                  Sec. 2-431. - Purpose. 
                  The budget serves as an important management tool providing information essential to improving the efficiency of program operations and as an accountability document providing information that citizens can use in assessing county activities and operations. 
                  (Policy of 4-16-2014) 
                  Sec. 2-432. - Responsibility. 
                  The county administrator prepares the budget and is responsible for coordinating the work of his or her staff as well as the budget activities of the department managers. 
                  (1)  By March 1, the county administrator shall prepare a budget calendar and distribute budget preparation information to all departments. Included shall be actual or estimated budget information for the current and prior years. Guidelines showing the limits with which the budget requests should be prepared shall be included. 
                  (2)  The county administrator shall be responsible for seeing that the calendar is met at each stage of approval. He or she may adjust the calendar as necessary to the extent it does not violate statutory requirements. 
                  (Policy of 4-16-2014) 
                  Sec. 2-433. - Policy. 
                  (a)  The fiscal year for the county shall begin July 1 and end June 30 of each year. 
                  (b)  The operating budgets originally adopted may be amended throughout the year by the board subject to provisions of Georgia state law and as herein contained. 
                  (c)  The county shall finance current expenditures with current revenues. 
                  (d)  All revenues which are reasonably expected to be unexpended and unencumbered at the end of the fiscal year shall be anticipated as "fund balance" in the budget of the following year. 
                  (e)  The budget shall provide for adequate maintenance of capital equipment and facilities and for its orderly replacement. 
                  (f)  All funds except trust and agency funds and the sheriffs federal and state condemnation funds are subject to the annual budget process 
                  (g)  The budget must be balanced for all budgeted funds. Total anticipated revenues must equal total estimated expenditures for the general, special revenue, and capital project funds. 
                  (h)  All budgets shall be adopted on a basis of accounting consistent with generally accepted accounting principles. Revenues are budgeted when they become measurable and available. Expenditures are charged against the budget when they become measurable, a liability has been incurred, and the liability shall be liquidated with current resources. 
                  (i)  The budget shall be adopted at the legal level of budgetary control which is the fund/department level. Expenditures may not exceed the total for any department within a fund without the approval of the board. 
                  (j)  The county shall include a line item in the general fund for unforeseen, emergency operating expenditures. The amount of this contingency is detailed in the fund reserve policies. 
                  (k)  The county shall maintain a budgetary control system to ensure adherence to the budget and will have available timely monthly financial reports comparing actual revenues, expenditures, and encumbrances with budgeted amounts. 
                  (l)  The budget shall reflect both fixed and variable costs whenever practical. 
                  (Policy of 4-16-2014) 
                  Sec. 2-434. - Budget amendments. 
                  (a)  Transfers within departments may be authorized by the county administrator. 
                  (b)  Transfers between departments or funds shall be by authority of the board. 
                  (c)  Increase or decrease in the total fund appropriation shall be by authority of the board. 
                  (d)  Increase or decrease in salary appropriation within any department shall be determined through the annual budget process. 
                  (e)  Appropriation of fund balances shall be by authority of the board. 
                  (Policy of 4-16-2014) 
                  Sec. 2-435. - Budget increases. 
                  Funds must limit expenditures to current year revenues except in the following instances: 
                  (1)  Prior year encumbrances. Prior year open purchase orders act as a reserve against fund balance and will reduce fund balance when paid. 
                  (2)  Unanticipated revenue. Unanticipated revenue shall first be committed to satisfy revenue reserve requirements and then may be appropriated for current year nonrecurring expenditures. 
                  (Policy of 4-16-2014) 
                  Sec. 2-436. - Budget decreases. 
                  Where economic conditions dictate, budgets may be decreased to levels below adopted appropriations. The county administrator shall notify departments of the anticipated level of reductions detailing the order of preference in reductions. Amounts decreased from specific line items in each fund shall be entered as a line item entitled "frozen appropriations". This does not automatically decrease appropriations, but prevents expenditures until such time as budget amounts are available for appropriation. 
                  (Policy of 4-16-2014) 
                  Sec. 2-437. - Lapsing of appropriations. 
                  Unexpended appropriations at the end of the fiscal year shall lapse into the fund balance. Those amounts cannot be spent unless re-appropriated in the succeeding fiscal year with certain exceptions: 
                  (1)  Capital projects, excluding equipment. Appropriations for capital projects do not automatically lapse at the end of the fiscal year. However, carryover must be budgeted by the department for the following fiscal year and re-appropriated by the board. 
                  (2)  Grant funds. Appropriations funded by state or federal grants lapse only at the expiration of a grant or completion of the project.

                  Sec. 2-451. - Purpose. 
                  The county shall seek to maintain and, if possible, improve its current municipal bond rating so that borrowing costs are minimized and access to credit preserved. 
                  (Policy of 4-16-2014) 
                  Sec. 2-452. - Policy. 
                  (a)  The county shall develop adequate reserves to avoid the necessity of short-term borrowing to finance operating needs. In the interim, financing in anticipation of a definite fixed source of revenue, such as tax anticipation notes, is acceptable. 
                  (b)  The issuance of long-term debt shall be limited to capital improvements or projects which cannot be financed from current revenues or resources. 
                  (c)  Every effort shall be made to limit the long-term debt maturity schedule to no longer than the estimated useful life of the capital projects or improvements to be financed. 
                  (d)  When the county utilizes either long-term or short-term debt it shall insure that the debt is financed soundly by: 
                  (1)  Conservatively projecting the revenue sources which will repay the debt. 
                  (2)  Financing the improvement over a period not greater than the useful life of the improvement for long-term debt, or December 31 of the calendar year for short-term debt. 
                  (3)  Determining that the cost benefit of the improvement, including interest and any other costs, is positive. 
                  (e)  The county shall limit the total of its general obligation long-term borrowing to ten percent of its net assessed property value. Short-term borrowing shall be limited to 75 percent of the source of revenue expected to repay the loan. 
                  (f)  Capital leases may be used to finance equipment purchases when the total cost of the equipment purchases exceed three percent of the budget for the fund in which they originate. 
                  (g)  The county shall maintain a debt service fund which is equivalent to the amount of general obligation debt maturing in the subsequent year. 
                  (h)  Whenever possible the county will finance capital projects by using self-supporting revenue bonds since revenue bonds assure the greatest degree of equity because those who benefit from a project and those who pay for a project are most closely matched. 
                  (i)  General obligation debt shall not be used for enterprise activities. 
                  (Policy of 4-16-2014) 
                  Sec. 2-453. - Debt planning policies. 
                  When the county is considering a possible bond issue, the county administrator shall develop information and present its findings to the board concerning the following categories:

The county shall follow a policy of full disclosure. Significant financial reports affecting or commenting on the county will be forwarded to the rating agencies. 
                  (b)  The county will continue to improve communications with other jurisdictions with which a common property tax base is shared concerning collective plans for future debt issues.

                  (7)  Any transferred proceeds penalty. 
                  (b)  Financial and policy objectives. The county may undertake a refunding to achieve debt service savings, eliminate restrictive bond/legal covenants, or restructure the stream of debt service payments. 
                  (c)  Financial savings/results. 
                  (1)  The refunding should achieve a minimum net present value savings (savings net of all issuance costs and any cash contribution that may be required) of no less than three percent to five percent or $1,000,000.00. This test can be applied to the entire issue or on a maturity-by-maturity basis. 
                  (2)  Federal law permits an issuer to conduct one advance refunding over the life of a bond issue. As such, a higher savings threshold may be required when evaluating an advance refunding candidate. 
                  (3)  In certain circumstances, lower savings thresholds may be justified. Such instances include when a refunding is being conducted primarily for policy reasons, interest rates are at historically low levels, or the time remaining to maturity is limited making future opportunities to achieve greater savings not likely. 
                  (d)  Bond structure. When bonds are issued, the county should anticipate the potential for refundings in the future. Careful attention should be paid to the bond structure to address features that may affect flexibility in the future.

The term does not include sake, known as Japanese rice wine.

Failure to provide proof that the applicant complied with state law during the previous license period will automatically deny the applicant the right to have his or her beer and wine license renewed in his or her name or any other person's name at the location of the establishment. All applications for renewal of an existing license shall be filed in writing between November 1 and December 1 of each year and shall furnish such information as the commissioners may require and shall be accompanied by the license fee [as] set forth in section 4-50 hereof. The renewal license shall be granted unless the commission has reason to believe that good cause exists for denying the renewal, in which event the applicant shall be given notice in writing setting forth the grounds upon which the license renewal may be denied.

In all other respects, the same procedures and requirements shall govern the granting or denial of the renewal license as set forth in sections 4-58, 4-59, and 4-60 [of this article].

                  The owner of a building, structure or service system, or his duly authorized agent, may appeal a decision of the building official to the construction board of adjustment and appeals whenever any one of the following conditions are claimed to exist: 
                  (1)  The building official rejected or refused to approve the mode or manner of construction proposed to be followed or materials to be used in the installation or alteration of a building, structure or service system. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this chapter do not apply to this specific case.

The construction board of adjustment and appeals, when so appealed to and after a hearing, may vary the application of any provision of this chapter to any particular case when, in its opinion, the enforcement thereof would do manifest injustice and would be contrary to the spirit and purpose of this chapter or the technical codes or public interest, and also finds all of the following: 
                  (1)  That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the building, structure or service system involved and which are not applicable to others. 
                  (2)  That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the action or inaction of the applicant. 
                  (3)  That granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other buildings, structures or service systems. 
                  (4)  That the variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the building, structure or service system. 
                  (5)  That the grant of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of this chapter and will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  Conditions. In granting the variance, the board may prescribe a reasonable time limit within which the action for which the variance is required shall be commenced or completed or both.

If the cost to repair, improve, or alter such structure is more than half the value of such structure exclusive of foundation and lot after the improvements have been made, the order may find that such structure be vacated and removed or demolished within a specified time frame. If the dwelling, building, or structure can be repaired, altered, or improved at a cost that is less than half the value of such structure exclusive of foundation and lot after improvements have been made, the order may find either that the structure be rendered fit for human habitation or current commercial, industrial, or business use within a specified time, or shall be vacated and closed and secured against entry. 
                  b.  An enumeration of conditions that render the dwelling, building, or structure unfit for human habitation or other uses and an enumeration of remedial action necessary to correct each of the conditions. 
                  c.  If the order finds that the dwelling, building, or structure should be removed or demolished, a statement that the owner and/or parties in interest shall be afforded an opportunity to repair the same and shall specify the standards of repair necessary to comply with this article if they so elect. If the owner and/or parties in interest elect to undertake the necessary remedial action, the public officer shall establish: 
                  1.  A specific period of time, reasonably established in relationship to the remedial action, during which such action must be commenced, including, if necessary, separate commencement dates as to separate defects or work; and 
                  2.  A specific period of time after the required commencement date of such remedial action, reasonably established in relationship to the necessary undertakings, within which such action shall be completed, including, if necessary, separate reasonable deadlines as to separate defects of work. 
                  d.  Provisions that if the owner and/or the parties in interest do not notify the public officer of the intent to comply within 15 days of service or publication of the order for corrective action for a building, dwelling, or structure that can be repaired at half or less of its value, the public office shall subsequently commence and complete the vacating and closing of the dwelling, building, or structure; or in case of a building or dwelling that cannot be repaired at half or less of the value, to commence and complete the vacating and removal or demolition of the building, dwelling, or structure. 
                  e.  A statement that failure to respond to or comply with the order within the required time above set forth is in violation of this article and shall subject the parties and property to the remedies of this article. A failure to respond to or comply with an order within the time specified above in this section or in the order shall create a presumption that the party to whom the order is directed or required of has not acted in good faith and has abandoned any rights or remedies pursuant to this article. Where a condition exists regarding any property that constitutes an immediate danger to persons or adjacent property, the public officer may shorten the time periods specified in this section.

The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (i)  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition.

The statement of the public officer shall be transmitted within 90 days of completion of the repairs, demolition, or closure. It shall be the duty of the appropriate county tax commissioner, who is responsible or whose duties include the collection of taxes, to collect the amount of the lien using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. ch. 4 of tit. 48; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply.

The county tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of whose lien is being collected. 
                  (l)  Enforcement of liens pursuant to this article may be initiated at any time following receipt by the county tax commissioner of the final determination of costs in accordance with this article. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes.

Redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81.

                  (o)  Where the abatement action does not commence in the Superior Court of Jefferson County, review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29. 
                  (p)  In addition to the procedures and remedies provided herein, the governing authority may designate public officers to issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted by ordinance, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and seek to enforce such citations in a court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this article.

                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 001-13, §§ 2—7, adopted Jan. 15, 2013, amended Art. II in its entirety to read as set out herein. Former Art. II, §§ 14-23—14-28, pertained to emergency management agency and derived from the Code of 1996, §§ 26-28—26-31; Res. of April 7, 1976, §§ II—VI; Ord. of Aug. 6, 2001, §§ I, VI. 

                  Sec. 14-23. - Emergency management and response powers. 
                  (a)  Declaration of local emergency. 
                  (1)  Grant of authority. In the event of an actual or threatened occurrence of a disaster or emergency, which may result in the large-scale loss of life, injury, property damage or destruction or in the major disruption of routine community affairs, business or governmental operations in the county and which is of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant extraordinary assistance by federal, state and local departments and agencies to supplement the efforts of available public and private resources, the chair of the board of commissioners may declare a local emergency for Jefferson County. The form of the declaration shall be similar to that provided in subsection (b) of this Code section. 
                  (2)  Request for state assistance. Consistent with a declaration of local emergency, the chair may request the governor to provide assistance, provided that the disaster or emergency is beyond the capacity of the county to meet adequately and state assistance is necessary to supplement local efforts to save lives and protect property, public health and safety, or to avert or lessen the threat of a disaster. 
                  (3)  Continuance. The declaration of local emergency shall continue until the chair finds that emergency conditions no longer exist, at which time, the chair shall execute and file with the clerk of the board of commissioners a document marking the end of the state of emergency. No state of local emergency shall continue for longer than 30 days, unless renewed by the chair. The board of commissioners may, by resolution, end a state of local emergency at any time. 
                  (4)  Effect of declaration of emergency. 
                  a.  Activation of emergency operations plan. A declaration of emergency by the governor or a declaration of local emergency by the chair shall automatically activate the county emergency operations plan and shall be the authority for deployment of personnel and use of any forces to which the plan applies and for use or distribution of any supplies, equipment, materials, and facilities assembled, stockpiled or arranged to be made available pursuant to the Georgia Emergency Management Act or any other laws applicable to emergencies or disasters. 
                  1.  The Jefferson County Emergency Management Agency/Office of Homeland Security ("EMA/OHS") Director shall have the legal authority to exercise the powers and discharge the duties conferred upon the emergency management agency, including the implementation of the emergency operations plan, coordination of the emergency responses of public and private agencies and organizations, coordination of recovery efforts with state and federal officials, and inspection of emergency or disaster sites. 
                  2.  In responding and conducting necessary and appropriate investigations, the director or his/her designee is authorized to enter at a reasonable time upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigating and inspecting sites involved with emergency management functions. The director is authorized to execute a right of entry and/or agreement to use property for these purposes on behalf of the county; however, any such document shall be later presented for ratification at a meeting of the board of commissioners. 
                  3.  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the county who requests entry for purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials. Nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while that individual is in the process of carrying out his or her official duties. 
                  (b)  Emergency powers. Following a declaration of emergency and during the continuance of such state of emergency, the chair is authorized to implement local emergency measures to protect life and property or to bring the emergency situation under control. In exercising this authority, the chair may cause to become effective any of the following sections of this article as appropriate: 
                  Section 14-26 (registration of building and repair services) to become effective if the governor declares a state of emergency; and section 14-27 (closed or restricted areas and curfews). If any of these sections are included in a declaration of local emergency, the same shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the board of commissioners and shall be in effect until the declaration of local emergency has terminated. 
                  (c)  Authority to waive procedures and fees. Pursuant to a declaration of emergency, the board of commissioners is authorized to cause to be effective any of the subsections of section 14-24 as appropriate. The implementation of such subsections shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the board of commissioners. 
                  (d)  Additional emergency powers. The chair of the board of commissioners shall have, and may exercise for such period as the declared emergency exists or continues, the following additional emergency powers: 
                  (1)  To direct and compel the evacuation of all or part of the population from any stricken or threatened area, for the preservation of life or other disaster mitigation, response or recovery; 
                  (2)  To prescribe routes, modes of transportation and destinations in connection with evacuation; 
                  (3)  To suspend or limit the sale, dispensing or transportation of alcoholic beverages; 
                  (4)  To make provision for the availability and use of temporary emergency housing, emergency shelters and/or emergency medical shelters. 
                  (5)  To transfer the direction, personnel or functions of any county departments and agencies or units thereof for the purpose of performing or facilitating emergency services; 
                  (6)  To utilize all available resources of the county and subordinate agencies over which the county has budgetary control as reasonably necessary to cope with the emergency or disaster; 
                  (7)  To utilize public property when necessary to cope with the emergency or disaster or when there is compelling necessity for the protection of lives, health and welfare; and/or the property of citizens; 
                  (8)  To suspend any law, Code provision or regulation prescribing the procedures for conduct of county business, or the orders, rules or regulations of any county agency, if strict compliance with any ordinance, resolution, order, rule or regulation would in any way prevent, hinder or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency or disaster, provided that such suspension shall provide for the minimum deviation from the requirements under the circumstances and further provided that, when practicable, specialists shall be assigned to avoid adverse effects resulting from such suspension; 
                  (9)  To provide benefits to citizens upon execution of an intergovernmental agreement for grants to meet disaster-related necessary expenses or serious needs of individuals or families adversely affected by an emergency or disaster in cases where the individuals or families are unable to meet the expenses or needs from other means, provided that such grants are authorized only when matching state or federal funds are available for such purposes; 
                  (10)  To perform and exercise such other functions, powers and duties as may be deemed necessary to promote and secure the safety and protection of the civilian population, including individuals with household pets and service animals prior to, during and following a major disaster or emergency. 
                  (b)  Form of declaration of local emergency.

The declaration shall state the nature of the emergency or disaster, the conditions that require the declaration and any sections of this chapter which shall be in effect.

                  (c)  Contracts with municipalities. In addition to the normal agreements embodied in the county's emergency operations plan for mutual emergency assistance, the board of commissioners may contract with any municipality for the administration of an emergency response program.

                  (a)  County business. Upon declaration of an emergency or disaster by the governor or chair of the board of commissioners, the affairs and business of the county may be conducted at places other than the regular or usual location, within or outside of the county, when it is not prudent, expedient or possible to conduct business at the regular location. When such meetings occur outside of the county, all actions taken by the board of commissioners shall be as valid and binding as if performed within the county. Such meetings may be called by the presiding officer or any two members of the governing body without regard to or compliance with time-consuming procedures and formalities otherwise required by law. 
                  [Note: Local legislation should be reviewed to determine whether there are restrictions upon moving the meeting location if it is only a locally-declared emergency and not a state of emergency declared by the governor.] 
                  (b)  Public works contracts. Upon declaration of an emergency or disaster by the governor or chair of the board of commissioners, the board of commissioners may contract for public works without letting such contract out to the lowest, responsible bidder and without advertising and posting notification of such contract for four weeks; provided, however, that the emergency must be of such nature that immediate action is required and that the action is necessary for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare. Any public works contract entered into pursuant to this subsection shall be entered on the minutes of the county as soon as practical and the nature of the emergency described therein in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 36-91-22(e). 
                  (c)  Purchasing. Upon declaration of an emergency or disaster by the governor or chair of the board of commissioners, the purchasing ordinances, regulations or policies may be suspended. County officials shall continue to seek to obtain the best prices during the state of local emergency. 
                  (d)  Code enforcement. Upon declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor or the chair of the board of commissioners, the board of commissioners may temporarily suspend the enforcement of the ordinances of the county, or any portion thereof, where the emergency is of such nature that immediate action outside the code is required, such suspension is consistent with the protection of the public health, safety and welfare, and such suspension is not inconsistent with any federal or state statutes or regulations. 
                  (e)  Fees. Upon declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor or the chair of the board of commissioners, the board of commissioners may temporarily reduce or suspend any permit fees, application fees or other rate structures as necessary to encourage the rebuilding of the areas impacted by the disaster or emergency. The term "fees" include fees or rates charged by the county for building permits, land disturbance permits, zoning applications, special land use permits, temporary land use permits and other fees relating to the reconstruction, repair and clean up of areas impacted by the disaster or emergency. The term "fees" does not include fees collected by the county on behalf of the state or federal government or fees charged by the county pursuant to a state or federal statute or regulation. 
                  (f)  Temporary dwellings. Upon the declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor or chair of the board of commissioners, the board of commissioners or its designees may issue temporary mobile home, trailer, recreational vehicle or other temporary dwelling structures or parks in any zoning district, even though not otherwise permitted by development code, while the primary dwelling is being repaired, provided that such temporary dwellings or parks are designed by an engineer and the plans are approved by the county health department and development services. The temporary permit shall not exceed six months in duration. In the case of a continuing hardship, and in the discretion of the board of commissioners or its designee, the permit may be extended for a period of up to an additional six months. Upon expiration of the temporary permit and/or extension, the temporary dwelling must be removed.

                  (a)  In accordance with O.C.G.A. § 38-3-56, before building, constructing, repairing, renovating or making improvements to any real property, including dwellings, homes, buildings, structures or fixtures within an area in the unincorporated area of the county designated in a declared emergency or disaster, any person, firm, partnership, corporation or other entity must register with the Jefferson County Building Department and secure a building permit that is posted at the worksite. Each day any such entity does business in the unincorporated areas of the county without complying with this section constitutes a separate offense. 
                  (b)  The cost of registration fees in a declared emergency or disaster is fixed at $20.00 per annum. Registration is nontransferable. The cost of the emergency building permit shall be equal to the cost for a building permit under existing regulations. The permit shall only be authorized for repairs. 
                  (c)  When registering, any person, partnership, corporation or other entity making application must, under oath, complete an application, providing the following information:

Toward that end, the following rules shall apply during any state of emergency declared by authorized state, city, or county officials: 
                  (1)  Essential employees shall be required to report to work at their regular shift unless called in early by their immediate supervisors or the emergency management director, the board chairperson, or the county administrator. 
                  (2)  The board of commissioners, in consultation as necessary with county department heads and county emergency management officials, shall decide whether to open county offices and other county work facilities. It shall be the board's responsibility to notify county officers if all or some of such facilities are to be closed. If county offices and facilities are open, all employees in all open offices and facilities are expected to report for their assigned shift. If county offices and facilities are not opened for business at the regular opening hour, all employees are required to check in periodically for updates. Employees will not be paid for regular hours that they are absent and their assigned office or facility is not in operation unless otherwise provided by the county.

                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the federal Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register, as follows:

                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this Code. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
                  Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum to which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced. 
                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced after December 17, 2010, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.

                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA flood maps. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle that is built on a single chassis, 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. 
                  (1)  The term "actual start" means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. 
                  (2)  The term "permanent construction" does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets or walkways; excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; or the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. 
                  (3)  For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, or a gas or liquid storage tank.

                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the start of construction of the improvement. 
                  (1)  The market value of the structure should be the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement or, in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. 
                  (2)  The following provisions apply to the definition of the term "substantial improvement": 
                  a.  The term "substantial improvement" includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  b.  Substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  c.  The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement officer, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project or any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
                  d.  The term "substantially improved" when applied to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations.

                  Sec. 16-20. - Authority. 
                  The state has delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. 
                  (Ord. No. 001-10, art. 1, § A, 8-10-2010) 
                  Sec. 16-21. - Findings of fact. 
                  The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. No. 001-10, art. 1, § B, 8-10-2010) 
                  Sec. 16-22. - Purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  (1)  Protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  Ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  Sec. 16-196. - Minimum standards. 
                  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection (9), a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts, except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 16-195(c); 
                  (15)  Buffers shall be maintained in conformity with section 16-197.

                  Sec. 16-197. - Buffer specifications. 
                  (a)  Except as provided in subsection (c)(3) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. 
                  (b)  As used in this section, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream that, under normal circumstances, has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; has the channel located above the groundwater table yearround; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. 
                  (c)  Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to the Metropolitan River Protection Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq., shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection (c). The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  (1)  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer, and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; 
                  (2)  The buffer shall not apply to the following: 
                  a.  Land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented; 
                  b.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  c.  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (3)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action along the banks of any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq., except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to land-disturbing activities for stream crossings for water lines or sewer lines provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and include adequate erosion control measures incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented.

                  O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 requires that certain minimum standards shall be adopted by local governments to protect groundwater recharge areas. This article conforms to these minimum standards and also the minimum standards of the rules for environmental planning criteria in Ga. Admin. Code ch. 391-3-16. 
                  (Ord. of 10-12-1999(01), § 1.0) 
                  Sec. 16-376. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the county and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that the county and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water. 
                  (b)  Groundwater resources are contained within aquifers, which are permeable rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. 
                  (c)  Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized. 
                  (Ord. of 10-12-1999(01), § 1.2) 
                  Sec. 16-377. - Objectives. 
                  The objectives of this article are: 
                  (1)  Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas; 
                  (2)  Protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development; and 
                  (3)  Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality.

                  Sec. 16-378. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Aquifer means any stratum (rock layer) or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well. 
                  Groundwater recharge area is synonymous with aquifer recharge area and means an area of the earth's surface where water infiltrates the ground, thereby replenishing the groundwater supplies within an aquifer. 
                  Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of groundwater to pollution from chemical spills, leaching of pollutants from dump sites, animal waste from agricultural operations or pollution generated by other human activities. 
                  Pollution susceptibility maps means maps prepared by the state department of natural resources (DNR) that show the relative susceptibility of groundwater to pollution. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas of high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential. 
                  Significant groundwater recharge area means an area mapped by DNR in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology (chemical nature and form of the rock), soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts, geologic structure, presence of karst topography (sinkholes, caves and fissures associated with limestone and other carbonate rocks), and potentiometric surfaces.

                  DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

                  Sec. 16-503. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The wetlands within the county are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within this state. 
                  (b)  Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
                  (c)  It is therefore necessary for the county to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities that may adversely affect wetlands. 
                  (Ord. of 10-12-1999(02), § 1.1) 
                  Sec. 16-504. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this article is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this article is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic nature and wildlife habitat.

                  Sec. 16-505. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Functions means the beneficial roles that wetlands serve, including: storage, conveyance and attenuation of floodwater and stormwater; protection of water quantity and reduction of erosion; habitat for wildlife, including rare, threatened and endangered species; food chain support for a wide variety of wildlife and fisheries; educational, historical and archeological value protection; and scenic, aesthetic and recreational amenities. 
                  Generalized wetland map means a map showing the general locations of wetlands within the jurisdiction of the county. 
                  Hydric soils means soils that form as a result of saturated soils conditions. A list of these soils is maintained by the soil conservation service. 
                  Hydrophytic vegetation means macrophytic plants tolerant of or dependent on saturated soil conditions. 
                  Jurisdictional determination means an official, written statement or map signed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or, in the case of coastal marshlands, the state department of natural resources. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland means a wetland area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  Temporary emergency permit means a temporary permit that may be issued in certain circumstances specified in this article. 
                  Wetland means an area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and distribution sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, commonly known as hydrophytic vegetation. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. 
                  Wetland delineation means the establishment of wetland boundaries by a representative of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or an authority designated by the Corps. 
                  Wetland protection district means all wetlands within the jurisdiction of the county and shown on the generalized wetland map.

                  Sec. 16-506. - Boundaries; generalized wetland map. 
                  (a)  Wetland protection district boundaries. The generalized wetland map is a general reference document, and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers and landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer or landowner to seek U.S. Army Corp of Engineers guidance as to whether a section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. 
                  (b)  Limitations of generalized map. The generalized wetland map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the county and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, (Public Law 95-217, codified as 33 USC 1344). Any local government action under this article does not relieve the land owner from federal or state permitting requirements.

                  Assessors and boards of assessors shall consider wetland regulations in determining the fair market value of land. Any owner of an undeveloped wetland who had dedicated an easement or entered into a conservation program with the government or a nonprofit organization restricting activities in a wetland shall have that portion of land assessed consistent with those restrictions. Such landowner shall also be exempted from special assessment on the wetland to defray the cost of municipal improvements such as sanitary sewers, storm sewers and water mains.

                  Sec. 16-575. - Activities to comply with site plan. 
                  All development activities or site work conducted after approval of the site plan shall conform to the specifications of the site plan. The site plan may be amended only with the approval of the county. The county may require additional information deemed necessary to verify compliance with the provisions of this article or to evaluate the proposed use in terms of the purposes of this article.

                  Sec. 16-576. - Subdivision design options. 
                  Any subdivision that includes jurisdictional wetlands shall be allowed and encouraged to use the following options: 
                  (1)  Lot size averaging. Lot size averaging is encouraged in single-family detached subdivisions as a means to work around wetland areas. The board of commissioners or its designee may allow a reduction in lot size provided that the same number of lots in the same subdivision are oversized by an equal or greater area. The maximum permissible reduction shall not exceed 25 percent of the minimum required lot area. The number of lots with areas reduced shall not exceed 25 percent of the total number of lots in the subdivision. The board of commissioners or their designee shall require no more than a 25 percent adjustment of rear, side and front setbacks for each affected lot. 
                  (2)  Cluster development. Clustering of residential development is encouraged. When considering subdivision approval, the county will allow incorporation of wetland or other significant natural areas as open space in the subdivision plan. Such plans should designate at least 25 percent of the gross land area as open space. Density shall be calculated by subtracting from the total acreage of a parcel all land dedicated or in use for private or public roads, including all vehicular rights-of-way. The resultant acreage will then be divided by the minimum allowed lot size of the district to derive the number of lots permissible.

                  Buffer means a natural or enhanced vegetated area located adjacent to a protected river and containing flora native to that area. 
                  Hazardous material means any substance defined as hazardous material by the state department of natural resources pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-8-60 et seq. 
                  Hazardous waste means any solid waste which has been defined as a hazardous waste in regulations promulgated by the administrator of the federal Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the federal act, which are in force and effect on February 1, 1988, codified as 40 CFR 261.3. 
                  Land-disturbing activity means any operation that involves excavation or filling of land, clearing of vegetation, and construction, rebuilding, or alteration of an existing structure. Land-disturbing activity does not include ordinary maintenance and landscaping activities, yard and grounds maintenance, individual home gardens, repairs or minor modifications to a single-family residence, or the cutting of firewood for personal use. 
                  Natural vegetated area means an undeveloped area largely free from human disturbance where naturally occurring vegetation is allowed to remain undisturbed or is enhanced and maintained by human intervention. Activities specifically allowed in such an area include: 
                  (1)  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, shellfish, and other wildlife. 
                  (2)  Outdoor recreational activities, including hunting, fishing, trapping, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, swimming, canoeing, skeet and trap shooting, education, scientific research and nature trails. 
                  (3)  Maintenance or repair of lawfully located roads, structures and utilities used in the service of the public, provided that the work is conducted using best management practices to ensure that negative effects on the previous nature of the land shall be minimized. 
                  (4)  Limited excavating, filling and land disturbance necessary for the repair and maintenance of structures necessary to the uses permissible in the area as above. 
                  Nonconforming use means a land-use activity, building or structure legally established prior to adoption of this article, or subsequent amendment to it, that would not otherwise be permissible under the provisions of this article. 
                  Overlay district means a district that applies supplementary regulations to land previously classified as belonging to a specific zoning district or land-use category.

                  (2)  The 100-foot buffer shall be measured horizontally from the uppermost part of the river bank, usually marked by a break in slope. Although not within the measured 100-foot wide buffer, the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river shall be treated by local governments in the same manner as the river corridor and shall be included within the river corridor protection plan. 
                  (3)  Because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering, river bank erosion, and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time. For the purposes of these standards, the river corridor shall be considered to be fixed at its position at the beginning of each review period for local comprehensive plans. Any shift in the location of the protected river after the start of the review period will require a revision of the boundaries of the river corridor at the time of the next review by the department of community affairs. 
                  River corridor protection plan means that part of the local comprehensive plan which deals with the river corridor protection requirements specified herein.

                  Sec. 16-642. - Protection district and plan; purpose. 
                  The Ogeechee River has been designated as a protected river by the state department of community affairs and an Ogeechee River corridor protection plan has been adopted by the county. This article establishes the Ogeechee River corridor protection district for the purpose of establishing measures to guide future growth and development in the areas adjacent to the Ogeechee River.

                  (a)  The Ogeechee River corridor protection district is hereby designated and shall comprise all land inclusive of islands in the area of a protected river and being within 100 feet, horizontally, on both sides of the river as measured from the river bank, as well as the area between the river's edge and the bank. 
                  (b)  The boundary shall be set at places readily identifiable on the county zoning map. 
                  (c)  The district establishes measures to guide future growth and development in areas adjacent to the Ogeechee River. Because these protective measures allow some latitude with land uses and because the district is not intended to prescribe a specific land use, but rather to define a range of acceptable land uses, the district is designated as an overlay district. Within the range of land uses which can be located within the district, there are established in this article protection criteria which apply to development within the district.

                  (a)  The board of commissioners may from time to time, amend, supplement or change the regulations set forth in this chapter or the boundaries of the zoning districts established on the zoning map. 
                  (b)  No amendment shall become effective unless it shall have been initiated by either the board of commissioners or the planning and zoning board, the property owners, or an individual who has the owners' power of attorney authorizing him to act, or a request signed by 60 percent of the property owners who hold not less than 60 percent of the affected land. 
                  (c)  All proposed amendments shall first be submitted to the planning and zoning board, which shall conduct a public hearing and shall make a written recommendation to the board of commissioners. The power to approve and enact an amendment rests solely within the legislative discretion of the board of commissioners. 
                  (Ord. of 7-13-1999(02), art. XXI, § 21-1(a), (b)) 
                  Sec. 20-122. - Definitions. 
                  As used in this article, the term "amendment" shall mean both a change to the official map and a change to the text of this chapter unless otherwise indicated.

                  Sec. 20-123. - Application procedure. 
                  (a)  All proposed amendments shall be initiated by an application with the zoning administrator on forms provided by the county. A standard fee shall be paid with the application in the amount of the advertising costs for the required public hearing. Application for amendment of these regulations may be in the form of a proposal for amendment of the text of regulations or a proposal for amendment of the zoning map. 
                  (b)  Within 15 days after receiving the application, the zoning administrator shall in writing inform the applicant of the date on which a public hearing will be held to consider the zoning change. 
                  (c)  No application will be accepted from any person regarding any property that is in violation of this chapter. If the property, at the time of application, which is the subject of an amendment or any other action of the board of commissioners, is found to be in violation of this chapter, then the board of commissioners will not accept or process any application from that applicant until the applicant voluntarily removes or changes the cause of the violation or ceases to be in violation. The applicant must then notify the zoning administrator that he is no longer in violation and obtain a release from the zoning administrator as to the violation. Once released, the board of commissioners will then accept the application for amendment of this chapter. 
                  (d)  Upon receiving an application for a map amendment and establishing the date of the public hearing concerning the petitioned request, the zoning administrator shall erect in a conspicuous place on the property in question or on the right-of-way of the nearest public road, if the property does not front a public road, a sign giving notice of both the existing zoning district in which the property is located and the requested change and the scheduled date and place for the public hearing. 
                  (e)  After acceptance of an application for amendment, the zoning administrator shall transmit a copy thereof to the planning and zoning board. The board will study the proposed amendment and determine if it meets the standards as enumerated in this division. 
                  (f)  Once the public hearing has been conducted in accordance with this division, the planning and zoning board shall make a written recommendation to the board of commissioners stating its approval or disapproval of the requested zoning change. Such recommendation shall be made by the planning and zoning board within 30 days of the public hearing or the requested zoning change shall be deemed to have been recommended for approval by the planning and zoning board.

                  (a)  The exercise of the zoning power of the county shall constitute an effort to balance the interest of the community in promoting the public health, safety, morality and general welfare against the right of property owners to the unrestricted use of their property. 
                  (b)  The factors set forth in this subsection (b) shall be considered by the planning and zoning board when reviewing and making its written recommendation and the board of commissioners when making a decision whether to approve or deny the requested amendment. The following factors are determined to be relevant in balancing the interest in promoting the public health, safety, morality and general welfare against the right to the unrestricted use of the property: 
                  (1)  Whether the proposed amendment would allow a use that is generally suitable for the site compared to other possible uses and the uses and zoning of adjacent and nearby properties; 
                  (2)  Whether the proposed amendment would adversely affect the economic value or the uses of adjacent and nearby properties; 
                  (3)  Whether the property to be affected by the proposed amendment can be used as currently zoned; 
                  (4)  Whether the proposed amendment, if adopted, would result in a use which would or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, schools, sewers, water resources, police and fire protection or other utilities; 
                  (5)  Whether there are other conditions or transitional patterns affecting the use and development of the property sought to be rezoned, if applicable, which give ground for either approval or disapproval of the proposed amendment. 
                  (c)  The county planning and zoning board and the board of commissioners shall consider any proposed amendment properly initiated in light of the factors set forth in this section. In evaluating the factors, it shall be the policy of the county to exercise its zoning power in conformity with the policy and intent of the county comprehensive plan insofar as that plan is current in its application to the specific property that is the subject of the proposed amendment. 
                  (d)  It is further the policy of the county to exercise the zoning power for purposes of assuring the compatibility of use of adjacent and nearby properties and the preservation of the economic value of adjacent and nearby properties while enabling a reasonable use of all property.

                  (d)  The planning and zoning board shall prescribe the rules of order for its deliberations on matters with which it is charged under this chapter, and said rules of order shall be consistent with the general requirements and purposes set forth in this chapter and state law concerning conduct of proceedings of public commissions, bodies and governmental units.

                  (2)  The person speaking will be allowed two minutes to express opinions and make points on each separate element of the proposed zoning revisions which he wishes to address; provided, however, that no person shall speak longer than an aggregate of ten minutes. 
                  (3)  Any remark amounting to an attack on the character or personal integrity of another individual, or a comment not factually supportable, or a comment in the form of an emotional outburst, shall be not germane to the purpose of any hearing and may be ruled out of order. 
                  (4)  Additional persons will be recognized in accordance with the procedure set forth above for the purpose of addressing additional issues and making additional points, but no speaker shall be allowed to address points which have already been thoroughly discussed.

                  (2)  No point of ingress/egress shall be allowed within 35 feet of the right-of-way line of any street intersection; 
                  (3)  An ingress/egress driveway shall be located not closer than 30 feet to another such driveway on the same street.

                  Sec. 20-403. - Access to arterial roads. 
                  When a subdivision is proposed with frontage along an existing arterial road, or state numbered highway, every attempt must be made to provide an access road or frontage road for direct access to the proposed lots. The planning and zoning board shall evaluate this requirement in an attempt to reduce the number and frequency of curb cuts along arterial roads and state numbered highways.

                  Sec. 20-404. - Street right-of-way widths. 
                  Street rights-of-way are designed and developed to serve several functions: to carry motor vehicle traffic, and in some cases, allow on-street parking; to provide a safe and convenient passageway for pedestrian traffic; and to serve as an important link in the county's drainage system. In order to fulfill these objectives, minimum street right-of-way widths shall be as follows: 
                  (1)  Curb-and-gutter type of construction. 

                   
                  (2)  Shoulder lane type of construction.

                  (a)  Grades on arterial, collector and industrial streets shall not exceed seven percent; grades on commercial streets shall not exceed ten percent; grades on residential streets shall not exceed 13 percent; all curbed and paved raised edge streets shall have a minimum grade of one percent. 
                  (b)  All changes in grade shall be connected by a vertical curve so constructed as to afford a minimum sight distance, said sight distance being measured from the driver's eyes, which are assumed to be 3¾ feet above the pavement surface, to an object six inches high on the pavement.

                  (a)  Where a deflection angle of more than ten degrees in the alignment of a street occurs, the radius of curvature of the centerline of said street shall be not less than as follows: 

                   
                  (b)  A tangent of at least 100 feet in length shall be introduced between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets. 
                  (c)  Right-of-way lines at street intersections shall have a radius of curvature of not less than 20 feet. Wherever necessary to permit the construction of a curb having a desirable radius without curtailing the sidewalk at a street corner to less than normal width, the street right-of-way line at such street corner shall be rounded or otherwise set back sufficiently to permit such construction.

                  Sec. 20-428. - Purpose. 
                  Improvement guarantees shall be provided to ensure the proper installation and maintenance of required streets, utility and other improvements. The nature and duration of the guarantee shall be structured to achieve this goal without adding unnecessary costs to the developer of a proposed subdivision.

                  Sec. 20-429. - Application. 
                  (a)  Before recording the final plat, or as a condition of final site plan approval, the planning and zoning board may require and shall accept in accordance with the requirements of this chapter the following guarantees: 
                  (1)  The furnishing of a performance guarantee in an amount not to exceed 120 percent of the cost of installation of improvements; 
                  (2)  The provision for a maintenance guarantee for a period not to exceed two years after final acceptance of the improvement, in an amount not to exceed 15 percent of the cost of the improvement. In the event that other governmental agencies or public utilities automatically will own the utilities to be installed, or the improvements are covered by a performance guarantee or maintenance guarantee to another governmental agency, no performance guarantee or maintenance guarantee shall be required by the planning and zoning board for such utilities or improvements. 
                  (b)  The time allowed for installation of the improvements for which the performance guarantee has been provided may be extended by the planning and zoning board by resolution. 
                  (c)  Upon substantial completion of all required improvements, the developer may notify the planning and zoning board in writing of the completion or substantial completion of improvement and it shall send a copy to the building inspector. The building inspector shall inspect all improvements of which such notice has been given and shall file a detailed report, in writing with the planning and zoning board indicating either approval, partial approval or rejection of such improvements with a statement of reasons for any rejection. The cost of the improvements as approved or rejected shall be set forth. 
                  (d)  The planning and zoning board shall either approve, partially approve, or reject the improvements on the basis of the report of the building inspector and it shall notify the developer in writing of the contents of the report and the action not later than 30 days after receipt of the notice from the developer of the completion of the improvements. Failure of the planning and zoning board to provide notification within 30 days after receipt of the notice from the developer of the completion of the improvements shall be held to constitute approval of the improvement and the obligor as well as the surety, if any, shall be released from all liability pursuant to such performance guarantee for such improvements. 
                  (e)  Where partial approval is granted, the developer shall be released from all liability except for that portion of improvements not yet approved.

                  The performance and maintenance guarantees shall be provided by a variety of means including, but not limited to the following: 
                  (1)  Security bond. The applicant may obtain a security bond from a surety bonding company authorized to do business in this state. 
                  (2)  Letter of credit. The applicant may provide an irrevocable letter of credit from a bank. 
                  (3)  Escrow account. The applicant shall deposit cash or other instruments readily convertible into cash at face value, either with the county, or in escrow with a bank. 
                  (4)  Subdivision improvement agreement. An applicant may provide as a guarantee a Subdivision Improvement Agreement between the lender, applicant and the county. 
                  (5)  Cash bond. A cash bond in the amount of $1,000.00 will be required of all timber harvesting operators using county-maintained roads.

                  Sec. 20-484. - Generally. 
                  Some zoning districts permit certain uses only upon approval of the planning and zoning board. These uses are identified in this chapter as conditional uses and such uses may be allowed under special conditions. The granting of a conditional use does not constitute a permanent change in zoning or use. The conditional use may be forfeited if it does not meet the criteria provided in this article. Generally, a conditional use shall be compatible with the applicable zoning district under special conditions. 
                  (Ord. of 7-13-1999(02), art. XII, § 12-2) 
                  Sec. 20-485. - Approval. 
                  Conditional uses shall be permitted subject to an approval by the planning and zoning board according to procedures established in this chapter. The required review shall determine whether the uses conform to the standards set forth in this article.

                  Sec. 20-486. - Conditional use standards. 
                  The conditional use shall be approved if it meets all the following factors: 
                  (1)  A rezoning to a more intensive zoning district, which contains that use as a use by right, would not be appropriate for the property. 
                  (2)  The location and character of the conditional use shall be compatible with the community development pattern and consistent with the needs of the neighborhood. 
                  (3)  The conditional use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of the natural environment or of other property in the immediate vicinity, or diminish and impair property values within the surrounding neighborhood. 
                  (4)  The conditional use will not increase state or local expenditures in relation to the cost of servicing or maintaining neighborhood properties.

                  Sec. 20-487. - Additional conditions and development standards. 
                  (a)  The planning and zoning board may impose any additional conditions and development standards, along with the grant of the conditional use, as may be necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of surrounding landowners, neighborhoods and workers. The planning and zoning board may require as part of its approval, the following conditions: 
                  (1)  Planted or screen buffers to reduce adverse or potentially adverse effects on adjoining properties. 
                  (2)  Limitation of street accessways, parking areas, and loading docks. 
                  (3)  The rearrangement of structures on the development site. 
                  (4)  Increases in maximum building height. 
                  (5)  Increases in the district requirements for lot size and building line setbacks, but not a reduction of these requirements. 
                  (6)  Limitations on the hours of business operation when it can be shown that proposed operational times would cause an adverse effect on adjoining existing uses. 
                  (7)  Specified distances from existing residential, public, or institutional developments. 
                  (b)  In no case, however, shall the planning and zoning board exempt any conditional use from meeting the minimum lot and structure requirements of the zoning district in which the proposed use is to be located.

                  (a)  The planning and zoning board shall hear and decide applications for variances from the requirements of this chapter, but only in individual cases of practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship. These include: 
                  (1)  Exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific piece of property, which at the time of adoption of this chapter, was a lot or plat of record; or 
                  (2)  Where, by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary or exceptional conditions of a piece of property, the strict application of the development requirements of this chapter would result in practical difficulties to, or undue hardship upon the owner of such property. 
                  (b)  However, the planning and zoning board shall not be authorized to grant a density variance or a use variance to permit a use in a district in which the use is prohibited.

                  No variance shall be granted unless the planning and zoning board finds that all of the following conditions exist: 
                  (1)  The special circumstances or conditions applying to the building or land in question are peculiar to the land involved and do not apply generally to other land or buildings in the vicinity; 
                  (2)  The strict application of the provisions of this chapter to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship by depriving the applicant of any reasonable use of his land. Mere loss in value shall not justify a variance from this chapter. There must be a deprivation of the beneficial use of land; 
                  (3)  The condition from which relief of a variance is sought did not result from action by the applicant; 
                  (4)  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of this chapter; 
                  provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited in a given district by this chapter.

                  The planning and zoning board when granting a variance, may establish reasonable conditions concerning the use of said property and may establish a time period for said variance so that the purpose of this chapter will be served and to provide adequately for the maintenance of the integrity and character of the zone in which such permit is granted.

                  When necessary, the planning and zoning board may require guarantees, in such form as it deems proper, to insure that conditions designated in connection therewith are being or will be complied with. Where any condition under which a request has been granted appears to have been violated, the planning and zoning board may hold a public hearing thereon to determine whether or not the permit granted shall be terminated.

It shall be unlawful for the zoning administrator to approve the plans or issue a building permit for any excavation or construction until he has inspected such plans in detail and found them to be in conformity with this chapter. To this end, the zoning administrator may require that every application for a building permit for excavation, construction, moving or alteration shall be accompanied by a plan or plat drawn to scale and showing the following in sufficient detail to enable the zoning administrator to ascertain whether the proposed excavation, construction, moving or alteration is in conformance with this chapter. The plat shall include: 
                  (1)  The actual shape, location and dimensions of the lot to be built upon. 
                  (2)  The shape, height, use and location on the lot, building or structures to be erected or altered.

                  (8)  Such other information concerning the lot or adjoining lots as may be essential in determining whether the provisions of this chapter are being observed. 
                  (b)  If the proposed excavation, construction, moving or alteration as set forth in the application for a building permit is in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, the zoning administrator shall issue a building permit for such excavation, construction, moving or alteration. 
                  (c)  If the application for a building permit is not approved, the zoning administrator shall state in writing on the application the cause for such disapproval. Issuance of a permit shall, in no case, be construed as waiving any provision of this chapter, and building permits shall be void after six months from date of issue unless substantial progress on the project has been made by that time.

                  (a)  The zoning administrator shall have the authority to issue a temporary use permit allowing a modular office, manufactured home or travel trailer to be placed on an individual lot for a nonresidential use where the applicant for such permit shows that it is necessary to use such modular office, manufactured home or travel trailer as an office or work area for the preparation and completion of a construction project. 
                  (b)  The planning and zoning board may authorize the zoning administrator to issue a temporary hardship permit for medical reasons for a manufactured home or travel trailer in a situation where the unit will be used as an accessory dwelling by a member of the property owner's family. The medical disability must be certified by a physician and the member must be an immediate member of the property owner's family. Also, it must be shown by the applicant that the permit is necessary and the dwelling must be located nearby because the family member requires continuous observation.

                  Sec. 20-641. - Residential-Agricultural District (R-A). 
                  The R-A district is established to provide for rural farm or non-farm residences in areas where intensive land development is unlikely to occur. 
                  (Ord. of 7-13-1999(02), art. XV, § 15-1.1) 
                  Sec. 20-642. - Low Density Residential District (R-1). 
                  The R-1 district is established to provide for low-density, non-farm residential uses of land and structures where intensive land development is unlikely to occur. The R-1 district is designed to serve as a transition between the R-A and R-2 districts. 
                  (Ord. of 7-13-1999(02), art. XV, § 15-1.2) 
                  Sec. 20-643. - General Residential District (R-2). 
                  The R-2 district is established to provide for the development of medium density single-family and two-family residential uses. 
                  (Ord. of 7-13-1999(02), art. XV, § 15-1.3) 
                  Sec. 20-644. - High-Density Residential (R-3). 
                  The R-3 district is established to provide for medium-density to high-density single-family, two-family and multifamily residential developments. This district includes: multifamily residential dwellings such as townhouse residential units at a density of not greater than eight units per gross acre and apartment residential units at a density of not greater than 14 units per gross acre. 
                  (Ord. of 7-13-1999(02), art. XV, § 15-1.4) 
                  Sec. 20-645. - Neighborhood Commercial District (C-1). 
                  The C-1 district is established to provide decentralized areas for the retail sales of goods and for personal services which provide the everyday necessities and conveniences of local residents. This district is intended to permit only those nonresidential commercial uses of land and structures which blend smoothly into the character of adjoining residential areas. It is further intended to exclude all activities which generate perceptible light or noise or attract traffic from outside the immediate neighborhood. 
                  (Ord. of 7-13-1999(02), art. XV, § 15-1.5) 
                  Sec. 20-646. - General Commercial District (C-2). 
                  The C-2 district is established to provide for both highway commercial and planned commercial shopping or service centers. This district is intended to be utilized by those commercial uses which cater to community and regional shoppers as well as the traveling public. These commercial uses occupy relatively large sites and require access to major thoroughfares. It is intended that this district be located at major road intersections as provided by the county's development plan. 
                  (Ord. of 7-13-1999(02), art. XV, § 15-1.6) 
                  Sec. 20-647. - Heavy Commercial District (C-3). 
                  The C-3 district is established to provide areas for distribution, sales, service or storage activities involving goods or equipment requiring extensive indoor or outdoor spaces, large or specialized handling equipment or significant truck or rail transportation. These uses generate limited emissions and noise which make them incompatible with other commercial or residential uses. 
                  (Ord. of 7-13-1999(02), art. XV, § 15-1.7) 
                  Sec. 20-648. - Light Industrial District (M-1). 
                  The M-1 district is established to provide areas for industry in locations which lie near residential areas or which are served by major transportation facilities and adequate utilities, but are not feasible or highly desirable for conventional industrial development because of proximity to residential, recreational, retail or related developments. The regulations of this district are intended to encourage development compatible with uses of residential property adjoining or surrounding the district, with suitable open spaces, landscaping and parking area.

                  Sec. 20-649. - General Industrial District (M-2). 
                  The M-2 district is established to provide areas for manufacturing, assembling, fabricating, warehousing and related activities. These uses generate some emissions and have some adverse effects on surrounding properties and are not compatible with primary commercial, institutional and residential uses. 
                  (Ord. of 7-13-1999(02), art. XV, § 15-1.9) 
                  Sec. 20-650. - Professional District (P-1). 
                  The P-1 district is established to provide for the development of structures for professional services which do not generate large volumes of traffic, noise or other harmful effects on adjoining residential areas. It is intended that this district serve as a transition between more intensely developed commercial districts and residential districts.

                  Sec. 20-651. - Planned Unit Development District (PUD). 
                  (a)  The intent of the PUD district is to permit greater flexibility and consequently more creative and imaginative design for the development of residential, commercial and industrial areas than is generally possible under conventional zoning regulations. It is further intended to promote more economical and efficient use of the land while providing a harmonious variety of housing choices, a high level of amenities, and preservation of natural qualities of open spaces. 
                  (b)  Within the planned unit development a variety of housing types and land uses may be permitted in an orderly relationship to one another and to existing land uses, as well as with due regard to comprehensive planning within the county. It is intended that this district be permitted only in areas where public water, sewer and other urban services are available.

                  Sec. 20-652. - Planned Development District (PDD). 
                  (a)  The intent of the PDD district is to serve as a transition between more intensely developed commercial districts and single-family residential areas along major growth corridors. Special consideration shall be given to traffic safety, off-street parking and how the proposed development relates to and is buffered from existing homes. 
                  (b)  Major growth corridors are areas designated by resolution of the board of commissioners where intense growth is projected and where major road improvements are planned, in progress, or have been completed.

                  (1)  Unless otherwise indicated, the district boundaries are lot lines, the centerlines of streets, railroad rights-of-way, streams, or such lines extended. Where district boundaries cut a block transversely or longitudinally, the line shall not cut through a lot, but shall coincide with the appropriate lot lines. 
                  (2)  Where the district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the corporate limit, such corporate limit line shall be construed to be such boundary. 
                  (3)  Zoning district boundary lines not coinciding with lot lines, the centerlines of streets or alleys or such lines extended, railroad right-of-way lines, the centerlines of creeks or streams, or the corporate lines of any incorporated places in the county as it existed at the time of the enactment of this chapter shall be determined by use of the scale of the official zoning map of the county, unless actual dimensions are noted.

                  (a)  If in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, changes are made in the district boundaries or other information portrayed on the official zoning map, changes shall be made on the official zoning map by the planning and zoning board promptly, after the amendment has been approved by the board of commissioners. 
                  (b)  No amendment to this chapter which involves matter portrayed on the official zoning map shall become effective until after such change and entry have been made on said map. 
                  (c)  Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the official zoning map which may from time to time be made or published, the official zoning map, which shall be located in the office of the county tax assessor's office, shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of land in the county.

                  (a)  Business with own dumpster. The owner of a commercial business which has its own dumpster will be exempt from paying the solid waste maintenance fee if the owner has completed a request for solid waste maintenance fee exemption form. If the commercial business has more than one owner, the owners may decide which owner gets the exemption. In any case only one exemption from payment will be granted. This exemption is not good for other family members, employees or neighbors or club members. 
                  (b)  Manufactured home park with leased dumpster. A manufactured home park that has a dumpster leased from the county or a commercial carrier will be exempt from paying the solid waste maintenance fee. The park must have at least one dumpster for every ten connections. One dumpster will be required for each ten units or part thereof. If it is subsequently found that the dumpster or dumpsters have been removed after the request for exemption has been granted, the manufactured home park owner will be assessed the solid waste maintenance fee for an entire year as if it had just opened. 
                  (c)  Uninhabited manufactured home. 
                  (1)  If a manufactured home owner files a request for solid waste maintenance fee exemption because the manufactured home is uninhabitable, a member of the tax assessor's office or other appointed individual will inspect the unit. If the unit is deemed to be uninhabitable by the county, the unit will be exempted from the solid waste maintenance fee. 
                  (2)  If such manufactured home is to be utilized as a storage building, it will be transferred from personal property to real property on the tax digest. The owner of the manufactured home is to be immediately notified of this change. The owner will be required to affix a county-provided decal on the storage building (manufactured home), on the right side of the front door, indicating that the building is no longer designated a manufactured home but is a storage building.

                  (2)  The club must have at least one dumpster for every ten service connections. A dumpster will be required for each subsequent part of ten units.

                  (3)  If an individual pays the solid waste maintenance fee at their primary residence in the unincorporated portion of the county or in the City of Avera, his service connection in a hunting club will be exempt from the fee requirement after submittal of the request for solid waste maintenance fee exemption form. Their exemption within the park will affect the number of units within a park requirements, (the exempted connection will not count against the ten-unit limitation for one dumpster requirement). 
                  (e)  Residents of Avera or unincorporated areas of the county. Those citizens whose residence is in the unincorporated portions of the county or in the City of Avera who have their solid waste collected by a city within their service area or collected by a commercial solid waste hauler will be exempted by completing the request for solid waste maintenance fee exemption form. 
                  (f)  Churches. All buildings owned by a recognized church will be automatically exempt from paying the solid waste maintenance fee.
